       "'Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I\\'ll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\\'s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\\'am. Thank you, Keith, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s First Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2012. With me are Agilent\\'s President and CEO, Bill Sullivan; as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian; and the Presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis Groups, Guy Sene, Nick Roelofs and Mike McMullen.  You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please check -- click on the link for Financial Results, where you will find revenue breakouts and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. For any non-GAAP financial measures, you will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.  Before turning the call over to Bill, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its annual Analyst Meeting in New York City on March 8. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent Investor Relations website 2 weeks prior. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Agilent\\'s Q1 orders of $1.62 billion were flat versus last year. Q1 revenues of $1.64 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 per share, and operating margin was 19%. We generated $150 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in net cash. Our Q1 performance was a solid start to fiscal year 2012. Electronic Measurement revenues were $778 million, up 1% over last year. Operating margin was 21% of revenue, a 58% increment for the quarter. We saw strength in Aerospace and Defense, up 5%; industrial, computer and semiconductor markets were up 6%, with strength in the industrial subsegment partially offset by continued weakness in computer and semiconductors. We also saw an unexpected decline in the communications markets, down 8% year-over-year. The causes were twofold. First, there was the decline in wireless infrastructure or base stations for global network equipment manufacturers. This was coupled with a substantial decrease in demand from Chinese infrastructure vendors. Second, there was a significant decrease in investment in RF component supply chain. This decline overwhelmed our double-digit growth in handset test. While we believe this is a pause, we are taking a conservative position in our guidance. In our bioanalytical measurement businesses, you\\'ll recall that a year ago, we experienced some revenue delays from the Varian integration. This resulted in easier compares for our first quarter in fiscal year 2012.  Chemical Analysis revenues of $396 million were up 14% year-over-year. Operating margin was 22%. Life Sciences revenues of $461 million were up 14% over a year ago. Operating margin was 14%. All key markets remained strong. Environmental revenue was up 16% year-over-year, food was up 14%, and petrochemical grew 14%. Pharma and biotech was up 18%, while academic and government grew 7%. We made a number of announcements in the first quarter. First, with our continued focus on maximizing Agilent\\'s operations and improving gross margins, we named Ron Nersesian to the position of Chief Operating Officer. Ron led the recent transformation of our Electronic Measurement business. Under Ron, we also centralized Agilent\\'s order fulfillment operations. The new global organization should better enable us to leverage our worldwide scale and scope in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. For example, we have started shipping NMR sample loading automation and carry UV-Vis spectroscopy products out of Penang. Second, we have registered Agilent Infinity 1200 LC and 6000 MS instruments as Class 1 medical devices with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is an important step for Agilent\\'s strategic initiative in the diagnostics market.  Third, we announced 4 acquisitions in the first quarter. These include Halo Genomics, which expands our SureSelect portfolio and BioSystems Development, which expands our Life Science capabilities and sample prep.  Finally, in January, we announced that Agilent would initiate a quarterly cash dividend. This is a reflection of Agilent\\'s financial strength and continued growth opportunities and underscores our commitment to enhance shareholder value and return.  For the second quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.72 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year remains unchanged. This outlook assumes several factors. One, Electronic Measurement will grow approximately 2% for the remainder of the year; two, we will see continued solid performance in Chemical Analysis and Life Science, resulting in overall Agilent growth rate of approximately 5%. Revenue growth will be back half loaded, and we will have easier year-over-year comparisons. And finally, we will continue to deliver market-leading products while we make progress in optimizing our order fulfillment operations.  Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As always, my comments will refer to non-GAAP figures. Agilent first quarter results reflected the soundness of our operating model. Revenues adjusted for the changes in exchange rates since last quarter were at the low end of our guidance, while EPS of $0.69 was at the high end of the range, as operating expenses were well-managed. Indeed, the first quarter year-over-year operating margin incremental of 39% was at the high end of our 30% to 40% operating model of expectations.  Let me start with Q1 orders and revenues. Orders of $1.62 billion were flat from one year ago and down about 1 point in constant currency. Segment orders adjusted for currency reflected a 6% decline in EMG, while LSG and CAG grew 4% and 3%, respectively. Regional order growth rates in constant currency were 6% growth in the Americas, a 2% decline in Europe, 3% growth in Japan and a 7% decline in the rest of Asia Pacific.  Revenues of $1.64 billion increased 7% from one year ago, both at current and constant exchange rates. Both CAG and LSG revenues grew 14% or 13% at constant currency. Adjusted for last year\\'s Varian revenue delays mentioned by Bill, CAG grew 7% and LSG grew 11%. EMG revenues increased 1% versus the strong prior-year comparison and were flat on a currency-adjusted basis. EMG\\'s excess backlog due to capacity constraints has now been shipped. Regional revenue growth rates in constant currency were 3% growth in the Americas, 4% growth in Europe, 10% growth in Japan and 12% growth in the rest of Asia Pacific. Our regional breakdown of revenue was largely consistent with prior periods, with 35% coming from the Americas, 26% from Europe, 28% from Asia less Japan and 11% from Japan.  Now moving to the income statement. As I have noted in the past, while currency does impact each P&L line, it has minimal impact on our operating margin performance as a result of our geographic diversification and systematic hedging program.  Gross margin of 54.9% was essentially flat versus last year, while operating expenses were well controlled and increased only 2% year-over-year. Consequently, our Q1 operating margin of 19.2% was up 150 basis points versus the same period last year. By segment, EMG\\'s operating margin of 20.6% improved 30 basis points over year-over-year. CAG\\'s operating margin of 22.2% increased 350 basis points year-over-year, and LSG\\'s operating margin of 14.3% was up 240 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income of $244 million or $0.69 per share compared to $212 million and $0.60 per share one year ago, an EPS increase of approximately 15% year-over-year. Turning to the cash flow and our net cash position. Total quarterly cash generated from operations was $150 million, up $30 million compared to the same period last year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at a cost of $34 million. Our net cash position at the end of January was $1.6 billion, an increase of $135 million from the prior quarter and $1 billion higher than one year ago.  Now turning to the guidance of fiscal year 2012. As always, our guidance assumes exchange rates as of the last day of the reported quarter. Although the just-released IMF worldwide GDP growth outlook of 3.25% is 25 basis points lower than the assumption in Agilent\\'s previous revenue guidance, we are not revising the midpoint of our revenue guidance, except for the currency impact.  We believe the most likely economic scenario is indeed a soft first half, followed by a stronger second half. We are projecting a fiscal year \\'12 revenue range of $6.92 billion to $7.02 billion, which is based on exchange rates as of the end of January. At midpoint, our guidance corresponds to a 4% growth in the first half, followed by a 6% growth in the second half, and for the full year, corresponds to a 5% year-over-year revenue growth or 6% in constant currency.  For EPS, we are maintaining the midpoint of our prior fiscal year \\'12 guidance and narrowing the range to $3.13 to $3.23 based on $355 million diluted shares. The midpoint of our EPS guidance at $3.18 reflects 8% growth over our fiscal year \\'11 EPS of $2.95, which is consistent with a year-over-year operating margin incremental in the middle of our 30% to 40% operating model range.  Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we expect Q2 revenues of $1.70 billion to $1.72 billion and EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. Year-over-year currency adjusted revenue growth at the midpoint will be approximately 2%, while the midpoint of our EPS guidance is essentially flat year-over-year after adjusting for the onetime benefit of the non-GAAP tax rate adjustment made in Q2 last year.  Bill, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail around the communications end market. I think that was a bit of a surprise to us as well. Could you talk about some of the different pieces in there? Maybe geographically, what might be leading to your belief that this is more of a temporary slowdown as opposed to something more structural? Right. Yes, it\\'s a great question. And as you said, the -- we were surprised on the reduction in investment for test equipment, both the base station development as well as the component that go into the radio that eventually ends up into the phone. Our overall one-box tester that we use for cellphone testing was fine. So needless to say, Ron and Guy have done a lot of analysis, and I\\'m going to turn it over to Ron and Guy to give their color or commentary of what they\\'re seeing and what they\\'re expecting for the rest of the year. Ron? Thanks, Bill. As Bill had mentioned, the first part of the decline was due to the base station infrastructure build-out. And we saw the decline not only in the global suppliers, but also in the suppliers that are local manufacturers within China. This, we believe, is a pause in the marketplace as we have seen rapid growth over the last 2 years. But there has been a pullback during this most recent quarter. The second part of the slowdown is due to RF components, which get fed into the whole supply chain. And as you know, Agilent has a very, very strong position in base stations and a very, very strong position in RF components. And in both of those, our market positions are stronger in those 2 segments than they are in handsets. So that is why we believe it has affected our business. As we take a look at the forecast going forward, the deals that we have in the funnel, the discussions that we have with our customers and the economic outlook, we\\'ve gone to a conservative estimate of 2% revenue growth for the rest of the year, which correlates with the $3.18 that Didier had mentioned earlier. Guy, would you like to add any other comments? Thank you, Ron. I would just add that yes, China has been the place where we\\'ve been exposed the most with this trend on the base station and the suppliers for base stations. Going forward, we believe that base station and ecosystem for this industry will probably stay slow, while the handset R&D and manufacturing and their suppliers should keep going as planned. And I\\'ll put one additional comment on this. And again, for us having a quarter that goes from October to January, any time Chinese New Year is part of this quarter, we can have surprises over the decades. Fortunately, Chinese New Year is only every 4 years. It\\'s the same quarter as Christmas. So maybe Guy, you could comment on what the outlook\\'s like in February since everybody has returned back to work in China and the rest of the Chinese part of Asia Pacific. Yes, Bill. I would just basically restate that we have seen so far February being on track with our expectations. And as I mentioned, base station and the supply chain for base station would probably stay slow for the rest -- at least for a couple of quarters, with the handset part getting back to -- on track. Okay, that\\'s very, very helpful. And maybe Didier, just a quick one on the LSG and CAG side. You\\'ve talked about investing in the Varian business in the past. And at one point, you mentioned it was breakeven. When can we start to see some of that leverage come through and maybe some of those investments start to roll off? Yes. I mean, we -- as you know, we don\\'t anymore present the Varian separate from Agilent. We\\'re just one company. And you\\'ve seen -- you\\'ve heard like the operating margin improvement significant that both CAG and LSG have demonstrated on a year-over-year basis, which were, I would say, spectacular. This is, for a good part, the impact of the work that has happened in Varian. And it -- this -- we still have some way to go. We\\'ve talked about generating $100 million of cost synergies over 3 to 4 years. The first year was mostly around the SG&A. We are now showing the synergies -- starting showing the synergy on the cost of sales. And I\\'m sure we\\'ll get a chance to talk more about the actions that we are taking. And again, as we have said, both Mike and Nick and their teams, we\\'re in the process of essentially turning every platform that we received through the Varian acquisition to ensure that we have not only a platform that is highly competitive from a measurement standpoint, but also will be able to be manufactured at much lower cost. Unfortunately, that can take easily 2 to 3 years to make that transition. Bill or Ron, I should know this, but I\\'d like some perspective on if the RF components related weakness, is that a channel phenomenon, meaning sell in and sell through, or is that a direct piece of business? I\\'m just looking for if -- we\\'ve heard a lot about distributor inventory destocking in China, and I wonder if this is part of that, or is this completely separate? No, this is typically a direct sell through, whether the RF components that are used for handsets or the RF components that are used for base stations. But if there is, in fact, an over inventory situation in the channel, obviously people are not going to put in on additional capacity. And that\\'s the big wild card. By definition, as you manage through any inventory adjustment, people will put in additional capacity on the manufacturing side. How much of it was just a disruption as an artifact to the quarter, how much of it is an oversupply of components in the channel. Because not only are we not talking about power amplifiers, we\\'re talking about filters. We\\'re talking about capacitors. We\\'re talking about PC boards. I mean, there\\'s a whole -- all kinds of bits and pieces that go into a radio module just on the handset. And obviously, there are a lot of similar components that go into the base station. Understood. So Bill, basically this happens when a phone manufacturer takes down their unit forecasts and therefore, they have to work off whatever they -- so basically, excess versus their prior forecast. Is that basically the effect we\\'re talking about? Well essentially, absolutely. The overall demand on the end products is going to affect the supply chain. Typically, as you know in the semiconductor industry, the supplies always tend to get ahead of the overall demand. What has been difficult is we\\'ve had 2 natural disasters over a relatively short recent period, right between earthquake and flooding. And so I think in my own opinion, being an old semiconductor guy, that\\'s why it\\'s been so hard to read the semiconductor supply chain right now. As you know, the SIA forecast and some Varian organizations are believing that we\\'re in a pause period, and we\\'ll improve in the second half. If that\\'s the case, then just like we said, everything will be fine. But the signal and noise ratio right now is pretty high. All right. I appreciate that color. My follow up for Didier, I think you mentioned the -- you burned all of the backlog in the first quarter in EMG, but it looks like the difference between bookings and revenue is only about $20 million, and I thought that number was 50. So any commentary around or color around that would be great. And I just want to make sure, EMG for the second quarter is below 2% growth, is that right? And it basically accelerates in the back half in your guidance? Accelerates a little bit in the back half, yes. But it\\'s -- yes, it\\'s still a positive growth in the second quarter, accelerates slightly for the second half because we are talking about 2% growth for the 3 quarters. Not much -- and not an enormous acceleration in our conservative forecast, as Bill mentioned. So on the first question, Jon, I mean, if you look at our EMG backlog since in the last 3 quarters, it has come down $68 million in the last 3 quarters. And so we believe that we are now -- we have the right level of backlog. There\\'s no more capacity constraint as we have experienced. There\\'s always adjustments. Probably, the hardware component of the backlog will come -- probably come down further, but then the software component will increase. So net-net, I think that the best assumption is that we are now at a level of backlog that is not hampered by any kind of capacity constraints and therefore, anything that had to be shipped has been shipped. Just wondering, either Bill or Didier, if you can give us a little sense of how trends progressed throughout the quarter? Was the communications drop-off largely a trend you saw in December? Or could you just give us a little color as to how things progressed throughout the quarter? That would be helpful. Yes, we did -- the communication drop-off really happened end of December. We -- early December, we were pretty confident on what we were seeing still, and it happened end of December and then across January, with end of January being stronger again. Yes, a point to mention is that a significant portion of the orders were acquired right at the end of the quarter, so we typically see this type of pattern when people are holding on to purchase orders and they\\'re delaying the capital purchases. So the last week of the quarter was a higher percentage of the quarter than we typically see. And is this changing your way in terms of thinking about cost structure at all? In other words, do you have to step up investment here or alternatively pull back a little bit in light of the communications drop-off? Yes. From my opinion, it\\'s too early to tell because right in this period of time, you had a major shutdown similar to what happens here at Christmas. And so I think the signal noise ratio is high enough. We have a very good record, strong record of reacting quickly. But given what our outlook is, the forecasts we have, we can still make our commitments moving forward. And so we\\'re going to not have any major change to our investment strategy. Okay. And then last one. I guess, as we think about kind of your capital deployment strategy, obviously, you announced the dividend. Should we still think about you trying to repatriate some cash this year? I think it\\'s about $500 million later this year. And should we expect you to prioritize Life Sciences within the M&A strategy? Or how do we think about your priorities? They have not changed at all. You should expect the $500 million at the end of the year. You can tell by the 2 of the acquisitions that I highlighted in my comments that Life Science continues to be our #1 focus, and I asked everyone to write their congressmen to hopefully get a change on the way foreign profits are treated by the United States government. And cash repatriation has no bearing on the -- our capacity to make acquisitions. So we are not limited because we -- the cash is here or there. Acquisitions we can fund one way or another. And so cash repatriation would be potentially just in terms of capital return but has no impact on our willingness and our ability to make acquisitions. So I just want to start again on the comms business. Actually, the statements about base stations weren\\'t very surprising. I think it was not too dissimilar from what we heard from Aeroflex, Danaher, and National Instruments as well. But on the RF component side, it\\'s a little surprising. And I\\'m just wondering if you think there\\'s any competitive issue in that market for you. No, I don\\'t believe there is. We\\'re on top of these customers. As a matter of fact, the customers that did not purchase or that declined, we\\'re working on them right now and working on deals that will close as we go forward as opposed to business that has transferred to any other supplier. Great. And we\\'ve talked a lot today about this incrementally weaker outlook in the EMG segment, in comms and RF components. When we look at Q2 coming in a little lighter than I think what the consensus expectation was on the top line, is any of that coming from the other 2 segments, or is that all in EM? We have -- when we take a look at all the segments, we saw aerospace defense come in stronger than we had expected at first, and again, the signing of the bill by Obama at the end of the year has helped us, and we\\'ve seen some money flow up. So that segment appears to be strong. Our industrial segment also appears to be strong. We do take a look at what our order rate is in the previous quarter and what is shippable, so that has an effect on the seasonality of the revenue that goes -- that comes out the following quarter. I appreciate that. What I was really going for is, are either the LSG or CAG segments incrementally weaker for the quarter relative to the back half? Are either of those pausing as well similar to this comps in market? Sorry, sorry. My apologies, Will, sorry -- comments on the Chemical Analysis side, we are right on the -- our order expectations for Q1, and we\\'re right on the outlook for Q2. So we\\'re right on where we want to be. Yes, well, we\\'re seeing some pretty good strengths. Q2 is always a little soft for us. But we saw a lot of strength. As you saw, the Pharma market really pulling strong, as well as academics. So we\\'re not looking for any big pauses. Yes. If there\\'s any message, even though we -- obviously, the guys have an easier compare because of the Varian\\'s miss of $30 million of revenue a year ago, even if you factor that out, our analytical business continues to be very, very strong. The story here of the quarter is we had a surprise in communications. That surprise, based on our forecast, will not have an impact on the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year. So the -- you\\'re looking for 2% local currency growth at EM. Could you remind us what the LSG and CAG outlooks are for the rest of the year, or how you\\'re factoring those in? Yes, so for -- it\\'s about close to 7% for the whole -- for the remainder of the year for BAM. Okay. And I guess your commentary, the academic markets have been strong. Was that still -- is that both U.S. and Europe, or is that mostly -- or is that still mostly Europe as we saw last quarter? Yes. Actually, the strength was pretty good across the board. Europe was a solid number for us, solid single-digit, and we had double-digit growth in general across the board as the LS total and academics mirrored that, obviously, they weren\\'t double-digit, but they mirrored that regional distribution. So we saw pretty good strength. U.S. still a little bit softer than we had hoped, but as most of you guys saw last 48 hours, Obama put through a proposal for a flat \\'13 NIH budget. So a lot of optimism because that was the nervousness. So we\\'ll see how that translates in orders, that 48-hour-old comment. Well, I don\\'t -- I mean, just from -- certainly from our Washington consultants, it doesn\\'t sound like that there\\'s much hope that, that whatever Obama put forth is going to last and survive whatever Congress decides to do with it. So that may be a little optimistic. On the rest of the end [indiscernible] communications, so I mean are there any signs on the industrial that things are coming in a little bit -- are starting to turn there? And/or are you going to be a little bit softer here? Are you getting any hints at all? What I am getting for is that are we potentially looking for a surprise on the industrial side? The industrial side was incredibly strong. It was pulled down, as we said, on the comms and the semiconductor side. The industrial part of our business was well above expectations, and again, I have Ron and Guy make some comments about where we\\'re getting the strength on the industrial side. So on the industrial side, we have a very broad portfolio that plays into the different marketplaces. And that we saw that and we had double-digit growth in that segment this quarter. So things look very, very good in that area. Automotive is a place where we have seen some strength, and I\\'ll let Guy make any other comments. Yes, and I would say our overall industrial computer and semiconductor was up 6% in Q1. We see this ease down, obviously, to -- as we say for EMG, at 2% total for the rest of the year. Some of the very strong business we got, for instance, both test activities were very good in Q1 and also some very good automotive business. The double-digit number I was referring to was just the -- was the industrial sector where you asked the question. Just one kind of clarification. If we think about China, we\\'ve heard from a number of companies within the Chinese area where things seemed to have slowed. I know you had the New Year issue, but how are you thinking about just kind of the overall business in China, and I guess in particular, a little bit more on the EM side since there\\'s a little bit more exposure there? Yeah, I think the best one overall, I mean, I think it\\'s well documented that the electronics side in China has got pressure on it. And the good news is, is that our analytical business both in Chemical and Life Science continues. But I\\'ll have each of the 3 group presidents give a comment of what their outlook -- what they\\'re seeing in China specifically. Guy? Well as you know, China has been very strong for us for the past years. And we see China very related to the comms\\' overall activities, both on the base station and handset. So we will see a slowdown in China compared to what we have seen in the past years. Yes, outside of the discussion earlier about the pause at the end of the quarter because there was nobody in the office for 2 weeks to take orders, the overall markets still remain very robust and strong in Chemical Analysis business from the food marketplace to chemical and energy, environmental and forensics, so very strong demand. And the comment that was made earlier from Guy in terms of the start to the quarter, we\\'re also seeing a very strong start in China as well this year, so -- in Q2. And I\\'m just going to echo Mike\\'s comment. I mean, no real change in trajectory. A lot of investment in Life Science, both the academic and therapeutic levels, and we did see the Chinese New Year effect, and we did see some strength in the last couple of weeks as those orders start coming back in. And then Bill, maybe just a broader question for you. If you think about that Electronic Measurement business, some peers of yours will -- even though they\\'re not seeing things slow at the moment, will look at macro indicators and PMIs, whoever, and will forecast the business just based on that because they know how cyclical or how tight it is to those markets. Is there any -- does it make more sense maybe for you to -- instead of just looking at the current momentum in the business, but maybe to look at some of those macro factors and use that in forecasting your outlook for that business? Well, we do. And it\\'s no secret that our correlation in the past to SIA, which we don\\'t like to talk about as much, and of course PMI, we know exactly what the correlations are in order to do that. But at the end of the day, it is -- we have thousands of sales people that are out there with customers and we know what the overall macro environment is, but there are just deals that are going down. And if we get there first and have a better solution, we can sometimes offset some of the macro trends. But we do exactly as you suggest. And obviously, when Guy goes to Ron with his overall proposal to grow, we know what that macro environment is. We have a very detailed analysis to understand where the competitors are, where the competitors are strong, where they\\'re weak. But at the end of the day, we have to assign orders quotas to thousands of people, and it is very, very bottoms-up detail of what we can do. This is Vijay in for Ross. Could you comment on the strengths seen in Pharma? What is driving that strength? What are you seeing in the HPLC? How sustainable, I guess, is this strength going forward? Yes, Vijay, a really good question. We continue to be on the same theme, which is we see a technology upgrade going on and we see an acceleration of the replacement cycle. We\\'re about halfway through that acceleration of replacement cycle that we\\'ve been seeing and talking about, and that\\'s a big driver. A big surprise in a good way to us was the strength we saw in European pharma. So not only the 18% overall macro, but Europe was very solid. And that speaks to me as being a technology upgrade. We\\'re seeing a lot of mass spec as well as LC going into European pharma. So we think that\\'s a biomolecule investment lends, one quarter of pretty solid results on top of a pretty good secular. Sure. And then maybe -- digging on an earlier question on -- in dividend policy, could you walk us through the rationale behind sort of initiating a dividend policy. What was the thought process? Well, the thought process was very, very straightforward. As you know, we have a substantial amount of cash. Most of that cash is trapped outside the United States. We are absolutely committed to being a high investment-grade company, so we\\'re not going to borrow against that money to return cash back to the shareholders, even though we have a long history of already buying back $8.5 billion worth of stock. Our number one priority continues to be in acquisitions, but we are a conservative company, and we will not make an acquisition that we can\\'t get back our cost of capital. So in this environment, what would it take to attract new investors? There is a growing segment of investors who are demanding to have some sort of dividend being paid for them to be able to invest in a company. 400 of the 500 S&P 500 companies today all pay a dividend. And so as you go through that rationale and environment that I believe will continue to have low interest rates by paying a dividend opens up the potential for investors to buy Agilent stock, and obviously reward the existing shareholders with a dividend and payback that is very measurable and not at the mercy of a buyback. That was very helpful. And maybe if I could squeeze one last one in and apologize if this has been asked. Did the Chinese New Year have any impact in the quarter either on orders or revenues? Yes, we -- well, sure it had. You can\\'t shut down, as Mike said, the last 2 weeks of China and not have an impact. That was in our forecast, right? We knew this. Every 4 years, this event happens in our Q1. The analysis we do just from the surface believes the impact was one point delta, right? But it\\'s hard to tell because behavior changes. If you\\'re going to shut down, why am I going to take the delivery if I don\\'t need it? Do I need the components or -- because we do the same thing in our own factories. And so it\\'s a very difficult event for us to fully quantify. Over the decades, Christmas, you know exactly what happens in the West at Christmas during the December time period. We know what happens on Chinese New Year. When they\\'re both together like that, it\\'s always interesting for us. But given the shift of our business into more countries that celebrate the Lunar New Year, we just have more -- a little bit more volatility when we have this event that shows up every 4 years. Just a question perhaps for Ron. When I look at the EMG piece of the business, and where drops -- we dropped the sales growth expectation from 4 to 2 for the full fiscal year. Is the majority of that or is all of that decline really calculated based on your current expectations for the communications business? As we basically have a very good quarter in general purpose and Mil/Aero, is the outlook for those 2 pieces of the business relatively unchanged? Well, I would just start by saying that one percentage point of the delta is currency related. So volume-wise, you\\'re talking about one percentage point reduction. Go ahead. Although we saw the aerospace defense business being strong, we have not expected it in our forecast to be as strong as it was in Q1, and the same thing with regard to the industrial market. So the other markets we\\'ve left relatively flat or relatively conservatively, and we\\'ve adjusted the communications market as we have spoken. So... I don\\'t think that that\\'s something that I have concrete data on, on the handsets. I know on the base station side, the component side, we\\'re very strong, and we have grown faster than the competitors in the last 2 years. But on the handset side, I think there\\'s a couple of good competitors that we\\'re fighting toe-to-toe with. And it\\'s going to continue that way for a while. Okay. And then just a last question. When I look at the volumes and the expectation for EMG\\'s sales growth for the balance of the year, it\\'s -- are there any significant puts and takes at the margin line? Or is the operating margin for EMG likely to settle in here plus or minus a point, I guess, with sales mix? We\\'re committed to the 30% to 40% incremental model that Agilent has. EMG has been at 40%. And even this quarter with the communications surprise, we delivered a 58% incremental. So we feel very comfortable that we\\'re running the business very efficiently and effectively given the macro situation that goes on. And I don\\'t anticipate any major changes from the path that we\\'re on to deliver to our model. Actually, maybe a follow up to that last one, very specific to fiscal Q2. When I play with my model a bit, if I take my EMG down to levels you described -- my EMG revenue growth down to levels that you described in your prepared remarks, it doesn\\'t -- it looks like you guys are actually building in an incremental that\\'s much lower than the norm. I know over the course of year you\\'re expecting to stay in the normalized range. But I guess what I\\'m getting at is if I take my EMG number down, if I don\\'t take my incremental down in that group, it\\'s -- I have a hard time getting to your EPS number for the quarter. Any chance you could provide your assumption for incremental in EMG for Q2? Yes, I\\'ll take that question, Doug. This is Didier. When Ron talked about committed to the operating model, the operating model does show that below sudden revenue growth, you do have decremental, not incremental. EMG did a fabulous job this quarter delivering stronger operating margins on very small top line increase and huge incrementals. I would consider that to be exceptional. In Q2, there is no doubt that as we envision the 2% revenue growth, the kind of incremental that our model delivers normally, you would have a decremental. We will have an incremental, but it\\'s going to be a very small incremental. And again, totally in line with the operating model. With 2% revenue growth, it\\'s a different story than the 4% to 10% that we had talked about. But -- so there will be a small incremental, but certainly not in the 30% to 40% range considering the -- only a 2% revenue increase. And this is -- I\\'ll add. And we had got a previous question, are we planning any cutbacks? We have quite a few product launches in Q2, particularly on the analytical side. And we have made a decision given the situation in communications and anomaly, how quickly will the -- or how long will the pause be. We\\'re going to continue and stay the course through Q2, get the products out moving forward. As you said, over the year we\\'ll look fine. But I think doing something dramatic in Q2 across the company, and particularly given how strong the analytical business is, wouldn\\'t be a prudent decision. Okay, now that\\'s very helpful. A higher-level guidance question. You\\'ve guided for stronger growth in the second half versus the first half. Is this predicated on improvement in the economy, or is this just largely a function of comparisons? There is no doubt that all the economies that we follow and track do anticipate a small improvement in the second half. If I recall the numbers last that I\\'ve seen on average, the expectation is that the worldwide GDP will grow about 3% for the first half, but more like 3.5% in the second half moving towards 4% in the first half of the following year. So there is a little bit of tailwind coming from the macroeconomic situation. We also have much easier compare. I mean, like all the talk we\\'ve had about communications, for example this quarter, last year, communications improved 45% year-over-year. So our compares vary in Q1. Our compares in Q1 and still Q2 are very challenging. They get much, much easier in the second half. So that\\'s also something to take into account. Okay. And if I could sneak in one more, another question on Lunar New Year. I know it\\'s always tricky for you guys to forecast when this happens when it falls in fiscal Q1. But would -- my guess is you can\\'t quantify the impact exactly, but could you at least say whether this was close to -- whether it came -- whether the impact was close to what you had planned for and how the more favorable comparison in fiscal Q2 comes into play? Yes. And again, like I said, I don\\'t want to use the Lunar New Year as an excuse whatsoever. We knew this was going to happen, we made our forecast and we\\'re off by effectively a point. And now that\\'s shame on us to able to make that happen moving forward. And as we said, it appears things are going back to normal in Q2. I mean, it\\'s our responsibility to forecast that. There -- it\\'s just difficult to know exactly what is going to happen, and then you couple that with well-documented event, particularly in the comms side that there could be a build up of excess component capacity. So how much of that is just purely adjustment of inventory, which has got to be most of it, how much was it just the behavior because you had a major holiday in January. And it\\'s -- quite honestly, it\\'s hard for us to know exactly what the answer is. But we obviously missed what the expectation was based on absolute demand in the component side of RF, as well as the infrastructure. Bill, could you talk about the market for LC/MS, where we are in the conversion rate to high pressure, the color in those markets? Sure, I\\'ll have Nick answer that question. But as you can tell, we continue to do very, very well in this market. Yes. And Paul, just for clarification before I answer, are you talking about LC, or you\\'re about LC/MS because you said LC/MS? Okay, both. Okay. So let\\'s start with LC. Yes, we are seeing tremendous demand for the UHPLC method. And therefore, we\\'re seeing more than 50% of the units going into the market being UHPLC capable. And that, by the way, is both an Agilent statement and a market statement. So while we still see a lot of people on the old methodology, they\\'re buying UHPLC-capable machines, we think this continues to be a really strong technology upgrade vector. It\\'s the comment I was making earlier about technology upgrade in pharma even in Europe going on. So a really strong market. That market is probably growing in the upper-single digits, and we\\'re doing a little bit better than market, so we\\'re pretty pleased with our stronger upper-single digit growth there. In the case of the mass spec market, tremendous technology waves going through not only to Life Science-specific customer sector, but also in the applied markets like food and environmental. And so we\\'re seeing a lot of strength. We had very, very solid double-digit growth in mass spec for the quarter in revenue and really nice momentum going forward. So that also is seeing a technology push at the triple quad and multi-sector end of that market, Q-TOF as well. Yes, sequencing is a great question. We\\'re in that market, not in a box. And right now that\\'s a good thing to be, is not in a box. We are in the reagents that go in front of the sequencers. We think there\\'s a lot of installed sequencing capacity at the gigabase large center world. We see a lot of installing of instrumentation going in the personal sequencer world, and both of those things are really positive for somebody who is in genome partitioning because we think the personal sequencer world is definitely going to be dominated by partitioned genome subsets and kits. And we\\'re seeing the gigabase world start to talk more about exome rather than whole genome. And you\\'ve heard the big box guys make comments just recently on how their new boxes are going do exomes fast. You\\'re starting to see actual data in their marketing speak or from the 2 big CEOs in this space about how they can do so many gigabases or so many exomes. So we\\'re pleased to see that, that terminology is getting into the market. The oscilloscopes play not only into the industrial market, but they also play into the computer market. So we don\\'t give those stats out on a quarterly basis as our competitors eagerly wait for our announcement, but we have a very solid product line in that area. And we\\'re very happy with the share gains that we\\'ve made. We\\'ve done a very good job, and we\\'ve gained share at the low-end and the high-end, if you look at the macro trends over multiple years. In any quarter or any period, someone could claim that they\\'ve done a little better or a little worse depending on what they shipped and what the flow through and what went into distribution. But our gains in oscilloscope market share have been second to none for all the product lines we have in the company. Well yes, I\\'ll take that one. So at constant currency, the Americas in terms of revenue, yes, grew 3%. CAG and LSG had phenomenal growth and EMG had a decline. Interestingly, just to complement also, order-wise, to be precise, EM had a 6% increase in orders for the Americas. So I mean it shows it is sometimes -- things are going to be a little bit lumpy. No, there were 2 areas that were particular. There were base station manufacturers in Europe that we saw some weakness and then obviously, the one in Asia. So primarily, the weakness that we saw in base stations was in Asia followed up by Europe. In fairness, the absolute correlation between where the order gets made and the revenue gets made and delivered, I would tend to look at these as macro trends from the region to deep down by region in the product line is highly problematic given how global procurement is done in this world today. I think the EM and the Life Science product cycle stuff is relatively picked over. So I did want to spend a moment on the diagnostics initiatives you mentioned in the prepared remarks. And specifically, what are some of the next steps that you guys are sort of working on for product development in that area? And then, maybe what kind of investments you need to make at the margin for channel development as you move forward this year? Good. I\\'d have Nick give an update. And again, we\\'re going to go in a lot more detail in our Analyst Meeting next month. But Nick, why don\\'t you kind of give an overview of where we are? Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Isaac. And as Bill said, we\\'ll try to give you a lot of detail on the 8th of March. But yes, basically I remember that this is still a small piece of Agilent where we\\'re just dipping our toe in the water here. We\\'ve registered factories, as you\\'ve heard a couple of quarters ago. We\\'ve now registered a couple of critical product lines with U.S. FDA. We\\'re continuing to produce a few things in the side of genetics area that we\\'re talking to the FDA about as well, and our reagent consumables side. Those will be micro arrays. We do not yet have a big push here. We do not yet have a big significant presence in regulatory or clinical trial management. And so those are elements that we\\'ll need to work through, and those are elements that are gaps not to mention, as you pointed out, how do we get to the customers and how do we educate the doctors, and those that where we\\'re off in reimbursement is something we\\'re also aware of. And as you know in the last 7 years, mostly organically, we have really built up our Life Science capability. That was task number one. During the course of that, we had brought in house the reagents capability, automation capability, the recent announcements that we made this quarter. And so we are putting all the pieces together. As you know, we\\'re inherently an organic growth company. Moving forward, we\\'re obviously going to look at ways to be able to accelerate Nick\\'s success through additional acquisitions. But I believe that our Life Science base is solid, and the diagnostics is the most -- next logical place to put our toe in. Sure. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. If I could just follow up with another thought there. If I put the comment you just made on the acquisition path in context with the dividend and all that, I think we can all agree that some of the diagnostics assets that we\\'ve seen trade in the last couple years have gone at pretty interesting premiums. So is it fair to say that if you guys find assets that you find interesting in diagnostics, you might be willing to take a longer horizon for your return hurdles that you might have also in the business? We will not make a bet that we don\\'t have high confidence that we can get a return in the lifetime of our shareholders. Yeah. So 2 sort of broad areas, I think I\\'m curious about. I think the first is just looking at Electronic Measurement business. And the source of weakness there, I think, one of the areas you highlighted was components in the wireless. So my understanding at the point at which you spun out your Semiconductor Product Group into Avago was that the vast majority of the components business, especially into handsets went out of that business, but you mentioned not just infrastructure components but also power amplifiers, just partly the things like that on your commentary today, I think, or during the Q&A. So can you give us some color as to what is the component percentage of that business right now and what the strategy is? And whether you are actually competing with Avago in that business, or you\\'re still focused on primarily the infrastructure side. So that\\'s the first sort of broad area of questioning. Yeah. Just first of all, we\\'re not making any comments about Avago. Avago does, in fact, supply RF components into the handset market moving forward. We\\'ve been very clear. We believe the handset test market is 25% of the total market. The other 75% is all related to the components that go into base stations and components that go into handsets. That\\'s what we\\'re talking about. The biggest impact is in the smaller components that go into handset. Obviously, when the infrastructure base station people cut back, that\\'s going to be impact to that component supply chain. But the component supply chain going into handset is dramatically bigger, and that is where we saw the impact. Yes, but we are seeing it only from the test side over there. It\\'s not components that you\\'re selling into the market. [indiscernible] we\\'re components business. That\\'s what I thought you were thinking. So we\\'re not competing with any of the guys in this thing. We\\'re not selling components. We are selling test equipments. I know, I got it. Yes, so that\\'s been a -- okay. So it\\'s purely from the supply chain correction over there impacting demand for your test equipment, but there\\'s nothing that you\\'re selling directly into the handset? Okay, got it. So I just wanted to clarify that to ensure that, that wasn\\'t something that I missed out on. The second area is just when you announced the acquisition of Varian and you talked about the delta between the gross margin -- traditional Varian products and the Agilent sort of similar products and where they could be, there\\'s about 1,000 basis points delta there. And you\\'d also identified opportunities for both your Life Science and Chemical Analysis business to shift production into Penang into your facility there, and get benefits from those businesses by doing that shift in production. Could you give us some color as to how much of that delta has been captured and how much more room is there over the next couple of years to improve those margins further and how much of the shift is still left in terms of production over there? All right. Of the $100 million of savings, $35 million is in corporate overhead, and we have completed that. And you can see it in the -- our expense structure. The other $65 million is all in manufacturing. One point -- we will get one point this year. It\\'s going to be back-end loaded. But we are going through and redesigning every one of these products. We\\'re going to do it right. And we\\'ve been very clear it\\'s going to take us at least 3 years to be able to get through this process. I have the highest confidence that we\\'re going to do it, but we\\'re going to do it right. I just wanted to maybe add some comments. We\\'re right on our internal plans in terms of the product transfers and the internal gross margins, but also this -- a comment around the refreshing of the portfolio which will drive not only improved gross margin, but also improved market share. We\\'ve just launched a number of very exciting new products and we just actually finished up a division review with Bill, and these products are exceeding our internal forecasts. So the portfolio strategy is coming together as well. That will be my teaser for the March Analyst Meeting where we\\'ll go in some detail. But we are right on our plans that we put together. And just one example that we had on the AA, we introduced the world\\'s first microwave AA that essentially will allow this instrument to be closer to some of the uses such as in mining, and not have to put it in an infrastructure to provide, for example, Argon gas. And here is an example where you spend money. Varian actually developed the work. They just didn\\'t have the money and the opportunity to do it. We finished that up. It\\'s been easy to tear their cost out, take their existing AA and just transferring it to Penang, but we\\'re not going to take market share over time. That\\'s our strategy. We\\'ve been very, very clear on that, and I have high confidence that we\\'re going to make it happen. Ron? I also want to comment that we\\'ve announced a new OF organization or order fulfillment organization that is focused on getting the absolute maximum leverage out of Agilent. And that includes for instrument products, the building of our products, the logistics and the supply chain. And that is something that\\'s brand new, and we\\'ll be updating folks on March 8 at the Analyst Meeting. So it\\'s fair to look at -- based on your commentary from the gross margins on the Electronic Measurement side that there is a potential for negative leverage as things go down, that the vast majority of sort of the efficiencies that when you gain by improving cost on the Electronic Measurement side are behind us, but for the Life Science and Chemical Analysis side, there is still very significant runway for margin expansion by reducing cost. Is that fair? So just a few quick ones just to clarify some things. First, following the comment that was just made about NMR, I think it\\'s an interesting question there as it relates to kind of the margin trajectory at BAM at least versus my model. It was actually surprisingly strong, and we think about CA and what\\'s going on at LS between the NMR investments, the Varian cost savings and the incremental targets. It\\'d be great if you could kind of walk through how you think about how the year progresses in light of the costs and I would say kind of below the COGS line? And I\\'ve got a follow up to that. Yes, there\\'s lots of parts to your question. So let me -- I think the easiest is just for me to give an example of what we\\'re going to do then turn over to Mike and Nick to be able to -- how we balance the portfolio. Nick\\'s example in NMR, Varian invented the technology, underinvested. The other guy\\'s done a very, very good job. We\\'re systematically going through and redesigning the console. It\\'s already transferred to Penang, redesign the probes, try to optimize the magnet manufacturing. These are all the things, and Nick\\'s -- in his past life was an expert in this space. And those are the type of things we\\'re going to do. And so we have that impact to his operating profit number, and it\\'s substantial. On the other hand, we know we can fix this. This is where the expertise of our Electronic Measurement Group comes in since it\\'s an RF measurement. And we will do that and spend the time to be able to make that through. So Nick\\'s getting an incremental, even though he\\'s making this investment in NMR based on the benefit of the growth he has in the other products. So that\\'s the example of things that we\\'re trying to work through and that is consistent with our operating model that we have displayed, and we\\'ll give an update next month. But again, we\\'re really quite pleased with the progress we\\'ve made in terms of driving the top line growth, as well as making these ongoing investments, as well as the impact of the acquisitions which again, it\\'s small numbers, but are non-trivial. So I\\'ll have Mike and Nick give some comments. Yes, Daniel, since that kind of gave the NMR an example, let me go ahead and give you one more layer of detail. I\\'ll let Mike do the subsequent comment. Just to think about this, to redesign a product, you also move the supply chain, and you redesign the new product to include a supply chain that\\'s based and leveraged. And it goes back to what we\\'re trying to do here, Ron talked about and we\\'ll talk about a lot more when we see you guys in March, centralizing order fulfillment centralizes our supply chain. I get the R&D team to design a new NMR probe or a new NMR magnet or a new NMR console and at the same time, we leverage the supply chain of a $7 billion company that\\'s heavily Asia based and rapidly Asia moving. That\\'s gets up front in the design. So all of these pieces interweave to really drive that gross margin element and the target is not to take the 10-point gap that was existent between Varian and Agilent and close that gap. The target is to take where Agilent will be in 2 years and drive Varian to that point, which will be better than where Agilent was by itself 2 years ago. Well -- and if I could just hop in for a sec, I guess that speaks to the kind of the real crux of the question, which is when we look at the incremental targets that you guys have provided by segment, it certainly seems like at least given what we saw in BAM in 2Q -- or excuse me, in fiscal first, the run rate actually looks, all things considered, like you guys are kind of above plan overall. And if -- it would be wonderful, Didier, if you could kind of speak to the overall run rates. When we look at R&D on a sequential basis versus 4Q, I mean, that number has basically stayed flat for a while now, and SG&A barely budged. So I guess when investors think about the flexibility that you\\'ve obviously demonstrated, right, with EMG having a very strong incremental in the quarter, how do these numbers directionally move through the rest of the year? Well, so -- and you can reconstruct that from the overall guidance I\\'ve provided. But yes, you will see as you do that, that BAM will have some really nice incrementals in the second half of the year. I mean, obviously, Didier, with the integrations behind us, we\\'re in pure execution mode, and lots of things are going on relative to supply chain transformation. As Nick talked about the portfolio transformation, and in few quarters, you\\'re going to continue to see -- if you look back, you\\'re going to see these reflected as it flows through the systems in terms of continued improvement to our gross margins, so pure execution mode. And I have -- and again to remind everyone, the call is at -- we have moved the company over the last 7 years to have a higher and higher percentage of variable cost, variable spending. And as we entered into 2012, we\\'ve raised the bar. Our goal is to have 21% of return on invested capital, now it\\'s 25%. We have set the pay for all the executives at a higher growth rate than what we just said. So that obviously builds into the system lower expenses as we go forward. And that\\'s factored in our guidance and factored into our confidence of why we believe that we can -- under the scenario that we gave, we can hit the mid-range of our EPS guidance. Yes. I mean it\\'s -- when -- to give a high-level view, and you can do reverse engineering of all the numbers I have given you. But on the midpoint of our revenue guidance, which is a 5.2% revenue growth, would generate for the company 36% incremental, which if you know our operating model, 36% corresponds to 8% revenue growth. So what is happening, a lot of the Varian cost synergies are starting showing up along with the benefits of the new organization. So this is a thing that adds fuel to the fire and explains why we are meeting the mid-range of our incremental guidance even on lower revenue. That really was kind of the heart of the question. It certainly does seem like the savings are showing up and investors can actually see the leverage that you guys have talked about. And if I could ask one last follow-up, I think -- obviously, given all the focus that we\\'ve spent this call talking about comms, the various end markets, it\\'s interesting because if we go back to quarter, we were all talking about the regional outlook and what was going on in Europe and how things were shaping up in the U.S. as it relates to academic and government. In this quarter, if my math is correct, it looks like Japan actually accelerated. Europe was a positive surprise, but the U.S. and China were a little bit weaker than expected. So how do investors think about the overall volatility given there is obviously kind of product and market noise, and then now it certainly looks like there\\'s a regional overlay that is hard to kind of reconcile when you build it all up? As I said, there is no lack of signal-to-noise ratio in this quarter. We have lots of good news, couple of surprises in there, different regional shift and again, I\\'m sure each of us on this call has a different opinion what\\'s going on. But this is the challenge that corporate America corporations around the world have and trying to navigate a pretty complex set of markets by region and submarkets that we have. And then, of course, the performance of the company itself. So again, it\\'s -- I don\\'t envy the investors in trying to sort out exactly what\\'s going on. Yes, I think everybody has to go, so we probably need to close this off for now. So, Keith, I\\'m going to go ahead and just close and thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please of course give us a call and thanks again. Bye-bye. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\\'s conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Caris, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]   As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to hand the call over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s Third Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2012. With me are Agilent\\'s President and CEO, Bill Sullivan, as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian, and the presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis Groups, Guy Sene, Nick Roelofs and Mike McMullen. Also joining is Lars Holmkvist, President and CEO of Dako. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor. agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results, where you will find revenue breakouts, historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations and an investor presentation. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. For any non-GAAP financial measures, you\\'ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia and hello, everyone. Agilent\\'s Q3 orders were down 1% and Q3 revenues were up 2% over last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 per share and operating margin was 20.3%. Agilent\\'s performance in the fiscal third quarter did not meet our revenue and EPS guidance. This was due to a softening of shippable orders, as well as a much higher-than-normal push-out to delivery from our customers at the end of the quarter. While we are not seeing outright order cancellations, we\\'re seeing all the classic signs of a slowdown. Deals are taking longer to close and customers are delaying shipments. We felt the full effect of this phenomenon in July, the last month of Agilent\\'s third fiscal quarter. The biggest headwind was in the aerospace and defense sector, where revenue was down 11% year-over-year. While U.S. government spending was stable, it was offset by decline in defense contract business. We would normally see an uptick at the end of the year, but we expect Q4 to be lower than normal due to fears of automatic spending cuts. The second headwind was in the industrial segment, which declined 10% amid deteriorating economic conditions. We saw more conservative demand from our customers in distribution channels across the industrial markets. A third headwind was in the environmental markets, which declined 6% amid lower government spending. Finally, Academic and Government research was down 6% while we saw continued softening due to budget concerns. The declines in these submarkets were offset by positive results in other areas. Communications revenues were up 7% over a year ago, reflecting strong wireless manufacturing test demand. Wireless manufacturing growth was driven by smartphone capacity expansion, primarily for devices but also for component manufacturers. Forensics Markets revenues were up 17%. Strength was driven by increased demand for screening and identification of abused prescription pharmaceuticals and designer drugs. Pharmaceutical and food safety markets also experienced modest growth. Finally, we saw strong growth in diagnostics, where our acquisition of Dako closed near the end of June. As part of Agilent, Dako\\'s currency adjusted revenue was up 14% over the same period a year ago, and business reported the strongest July in its history. The integration of Dako is proceeding well. Net result of this market, give-and-take, is that we ended up with 2% revenue growth for the third quarter. Even with Q3\\'s disappointing revenue, our teams continued to leverage the power of Agilent\\'s operating model. Agilent has a number of variable cost mechanisms that we are able to exercise doing economic cycles. In addition, we are continuing our ongoing process to reduce manufacturing costs throughout the enterprise. Agilent\\'s global fulfillment organization had several initiatives underway to consolidate manufacturing sites, streamline logistics and reduce manufacturing costs. We\\'ve been able to react very quickly to the economic uncertainties and we will continue to act conservatively moving forward. Looking ahead, we believe we\\'re entering a slow growth environment. As a result, we have lowered our Q4 guidance. We remain well positioned to react quickly to business opportunities anywhere in the world. We continue to introduce innovative technologies and solutions, supplemented by bolt-on acquisitions. For example, earlier this month, we introduced an integrated 1 box tester and multi-port adopter. This reduces the number of tests for smartphones and tablets that contain multi-format and multi-band technologies. We also finalized our acquisition of Test System division of AT4 wireless. This acquisition expands our offerings in wireless R&D, particularly in LTE. We recently introduced the 1290 Infinity quaternary LC system, the first ultra high-performance quaternary system that delivers the accuracy and precision of binary systems. And our other recent introduction, product introductions including the microwave plasma, ICP, Triple Quad and GC/Q-TOF are exceeding expectations. Our SureFISH Pro has also continued to do well. We have dramatically increased the number of customers evaluating this new technology. In addition, we have released our first translocation FISH probe that addresses the cancer market. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As always, my comments will refer to non-GAAP figures. Since last quarter\\'s conference call, worldwide GDP growth has slowed significantly to 3.1%, and the purchasing manager\\'s new order index has dropped to a 39-month low of 47.2, indicating a significant contraction in the worldwide manufacturing sector. In this context, our orders and revenues were below expectations, but we executed as per our operating model and delivered an operating margin of 20.3%, slightly higher than in the same quarter last year. I\\'ll now cover Q3 orders. At $1.66 billion, orders declined 1% from 1 year ago. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and currency, orders were down 2%. By segment, the 2% core order decline is the following: EMG, minus 3%; CAG, minus 4%; LSG, plus 1%; and DGG, plus 8%. The breakdown of the core order growth by region is Americas, plus 8%; Europe, minus 5%; Japan, minus 10%; and the rest of Asia Pacific, minus 6%. Moving to Q3 revenues. At $1.72 billion, revenues increased 2% from 1 year ago. Dako contributed $40 million to this quarter\\'s revenue. The core revenue growth, after adjusting for acquisitions and currency, was also 2%. By segment, the 2% core revenue growth is the following: EMG, flat; CAG, plus 3%; LSG, plus 5%; and DGG, minus 2%. Core revenue growth by region was 9% in the Americas, flat in Europe, minus 7% in Japan and minus 3% in the rest of Asia Pacific. Moving to the income statement and on cash flow. Cost control measures initiated last quarter, coupled with the automatic cuts from our significant variable cost structure and reduced variable pay related to the Dako acquisition, resulted in our achieving an operating margin of 20.3%. To put it in a different perspective, compared to the midpoint of our guidance, excluding Dako, revenues were lower by $97 million, while operating profit was down only $26 million. In a tough macroeconomic environment, we\\'ve delivered strong financial performance and continued to demonstrate the power of our operating model. Non-GAAP net income of $278 million or $0.79 per share compares to $276 million and $0.77 per share 1 year ago. Total cash generated from operation was $240 million, down $12 million compared to the same period last year, when we received $31 million from the unwinding of an interest rate swap. Now turning to the guidance for Q4. As always, our guidance assumes exchange rate as of the last day of the reported quarter. We are projecting a Q4 revenue range of $1.76 billion to $1.78 billion. At the midpoint of $1.77 billion, our guidance corresponds to a flat core growth for the quarter and for the full year, to a core growth of close to 3%. Our Q4 EPS guidance is $0.80 to $0.82. At the midpoint of the guidance, full year EPS would reach $3.07, a 4% increase over last year. I was wondering if you could make some comments on this Pharma end market, and I\\'d be particularly curious about NMR demand there. Sure. Pharma end market. Pharma continues to be a decent market for us. We see mid single-digit growth in terms of the orders and revenue in that marketplace. NMR and Pharma is a place that has been somewhat soft. Basically, they\\'re relocating a lot of facilities. And so, they have yet to buy large capital equipment in the chemical molecule space. And NMR tends to be more traditionally a chemical screening tool, so it\\'s relatively flat and flatter than the overall market. Great. And then just a follow-up. Are there any updates to the outlook for the Dako synergies in 2013, revenue synergies in particular? So for our forecast for Q4, Dako\\'s revenue is forecasted to be at $85 million. They\\'re coming off a very strong Q3, and we have not given a forecast for FY \\'13 yet, but we will do that in Q4 earnings. But Lars, maybe you could share on some of your views for the quarter and how the integration is going. Yes. Certainly, Bill. I think they\\'re making progress. I mean, a couple of factors that I\\'d like to point out. Number one, the advanced staining market remains strong, funding remains in place. We see robust volume and value growth across our regions. And secondly, and more importantly, Dako is making good progress. So we see sequentially, our business growing and coming up from a fairly low growth rate prior year. This is not a straight line commitment to say that we\\'re going to continue every quarter to deliver this growth rate. There will be some fluctuations as we move forward, but certainly Dako is making significant progress in our base business improvement program. Our investment into the Americas market, as well as the Asia Pacific emerging territories is bearing fruit and we see a very significant uptick of our business. New technologies are also picking up and taking good traction right now. Okay, so we can assume the synergy targets that were laid out when the deal was announced are still essentially in place. Well, I referred to Bill\\'s comments. Basically, what Bill said for the fourth quarter is in place and we\\'re going to come back with the specific revenues in this portfolio for \\'13. So I guess just big picture, Bill, maybe you can just -- maybe you can just talk about kind of how the quarter progressed, a little bit more detail. And maybe, as you sit here today, what continues to make you feel a little bit more uncomfortable within your business versus where are you feeling a little bit better? Well, the big surprise at the end of July was our inability to ship $50 million of revenue due to customers\\' unwillingness for delivery acceptance. And if we have shipped that $50 million, we would have beaten our guidance with Dako. And so, obviously, that was disappointing. It\\'s very classical in a slowdown that people will begin to push out deliveries. As I said in my prepared remarks, there have been -- there has been no evidence of cancellations during the quarter, but that\\'s the reality of it. So for our guidance in Q4, we assume the same order and revenue pattern from Q3 going into Q4. I think it\\'s prudent. We\\'re not assuming that this $50 million of revenue that was pushed out is somehow going to show up in Q4. And so we are taking a conservative position in terms of our revenue expectation, hopefully. Again, that there will not be continued deterioration for Q3. We are not planning for our seasonally high Q4 growth rate, so we\\'ll assume a flat Q3 in our core business, as Didier said. And then, we, of course, will get the benefit of the Dako acquisition in Q4 and that\\'s how we determined our EPS range. And with that $50 million, was it more weighted towards -- I know you talked about weakness in aerospace and industrial and chemical, but was it more weighted towards one particular either industry or segment? The delivery delays were very consistent to where we saw the slowdown of business. And again, the slowdown we\\'re seeing and I think, has been well documented in the newspapers and whatnot in terms of issues with prime contractors in the U.S. in particular and some issues inside the industrial segment. The environmental, which is still a large part of our business, again, is very much dependent on local government funding. And obviously, a lot of jurisdictions are in -- particularly in Europe and the U.S., under enormous spending pressures. Okay. And if I can, just 2 other quick ones. One just on Dako, just so I\\'m clear, that plus 17%, was that just July or was that a quarterly growth rate year-over-year? It was from the time we acquired Dako, so towards the end of June, a little bit over 1 month. And Dako, was that -- has Dako introduced any new products, I kind of -- what was -- those kind of new, more automated products have yet to be introduced, is that right? So Lars, why don\\'t you talk a little bit about why the quarter, I think, in total was a record, I mean, in terms of absolute terms in July, as well as very strong organic growth? And maybe you could describe some of the drivers. Sure. I mean, again, as I said, the market remains strong. We can see the reports from the industry and that confirms that the funding is in place and I think fundamentally, Dako is making good progress, and I refer to the base business improvement program that includes us upgrading our instrumentation base and us adding more sales people in front of the customers. We are yet to see the impact of a new automated stainer. And as I referred to that in the earlier call, we are hard at work at that. We are a couple of months away from market release, and we expect to see that hitting the market during 2013. And obviously, that\\'s going to be the incremental impact of the way they\\'re going to position that stainer. But fundamentally, the market remains strong and Dako is making good progress here, and this is across the regions that we see. Okay, that\\'s helpful. Then last one, though conceptually here just kind of following along on the Dako. I\\'ve got lot of questions, given the weaker environment in your -- the more flexible cost structure that you have, as your ROIC declines and you have less of a variable payout. Can you maybe conceptually just talk about how that plays out, say in an environment in which you\\'re planning on the ROIC hit because of Dako but then, let\\'s say, the environment is just a lot worse than you anticipate as well. Can you maybe just talk about how that -- how does that flexibility play out in that environment? So we have targeted, in terms of variable pay, 10% variable pay based on the overall salaries. And so that\\'s the base. And I think, roughly our total salary is about $1.3 billion. And so at the beginning of the year, we had moved the target at the 10% from a 21% return on invested capital to 25%. And so depending on the Dako obviously lowered for a short period of time, the overall return on invested capital, but any performance less than target, it automatically adjusts the Agilent variable pay. And we calculate that in terms of payout, the Q3 plus the Q4. And so roughly in Q3, our return on invested capital in total was at 18%. So  I mean, it\\'s a pretty linear extrapolation from a 25% target at 10% variable pay. It slides down very linearly along that vector. So it\\'s pretty easy to determine what an 18% return on invested capital would end up as a variable pay component. Does that make sense? Bill, so you guys have done a pretty good job, I think, over delivering on the core operating model, I guess up until the fourth quarter here. Obviously, with the revenue below. How -- at what point do we start taking structural cost actions, kind of in preparation or assuming this environment on the core revenue side continues? Well, I think, again, what we\\'re forecasting is, and I\\'ve been very clear on this, is kind of a muddle go-forward business environment. And if in fact that we are able to growth flat core plus the benefit of Dako, we are going to maintain a 20% operating profit without any major restructuring, and that\\'s our first order goal. Ron and the team have taken a lot of action to ensure that we can maintain our margins moving forward. We\\'re not anticipating another 2009. And again, there\\'s obviously issues with the euro still hanging out there. But right now, we\\'re forecasting a flat growth environment, and we believe that we can maintain our 20% operating margin with the existing head count. And again, I mean the one caveat is that Ron and the team and again, are working to drive out manufacturing costs. We are looking at site consolidations. So there will, in fact, be some impact in terms of streamlining our order fulfillment. But again, it\\'s not a major restructuring of the company. Got it. So Didier, are you willing to give the operating profit of Dako in the fourth quarter? And also, I don\\'t know if I missed this, but can you give kind of the core growth assumptions by division for the fourth quarter? That will be great as well. Basically, what we\\'re expecting is that a slight year-over-year deterioration in the core growth for EMG between Q3 and Q4, and also for the CAG in about the same core growth for LSG. And DGG, Bill already said that we are assuming $85 million of revenue for Dako. The overall operating profit on Dako is around the 15% operating profit. This is after restating from ISFR to GAAP. Of course, where R&D can be capitalized in ISFR also includes the investment that we are putting into Dako to beef up R&D and to be able to expand into Asia moving forward. But what\\'s interesting here is that the slowdown is in segments across all of the business. We\\'re not seeing what we saw in 2009 where the electronic business crashed. We\\'re seeing softness in academic and research, environmental, aerospace and defense and industrial. So as a result of it, as Didier said, it\\'s a lot of give and takes that end up with roughly a low core growth rate. Okay. So just to make sure, Didier, Electronic Measurement you said, so slightly worse than flat. Did I understand that correctly in the fourth quarter? Yes, exactly. I mean, overall, for Agilent, we are going from a 2% core growth in Q3 to flat in Q4. And so you see about the same kind of -- it\\'s homeostatic for by business or with EMG and CAG a little bit under the average and LSG a little bit better than the average. Bill, it sounds like Asia was exceptionally weak in the quarter and it seems like there was a falling off a cliff towards the end of the quarter. Could you talk about the country-by-country trend? Maybe give us a little bit of color around the China environment? Is this something you expect to be persistent? Is there a reset in your expectations? I know in the past, Didier has been relatively confident around the base trends there. Is there any change on that front? Didier noted the Japan being down 10% and again, I\\'ll have Didier explain exactly how we demonstrate orders versus revenue. But in ship to country, China\\'s business was up 23% year-over-year. This was all driven by the wireless business in EMG. Chemical Analysis and Life Science business were in mid single-digit growth rates. And Didier, why don\\'t you again, explain in terms of how we know regional revenue versus how the orders are necessarily placed? So we -- in all the reports that we provide and all the regional information that we provide, orders and revenues are consistently computed on the basis of where the order is taken. So if an order is taken in the U.S., it impacts both the U.S. -- the regional, the Americas order growth rate and the Americas revenue growth rate. The number that Bill gave you by country, we are able to track on a ship-to basis. So there might be an inconsistency between -- there is, obviously, between the number that Bill gave you, 22% growth or 23% in China on a ship-to basis, and the Asian overall, Asia-Pacific excluding Japan growth rates. But just because we want to report orders and revenues the same way by -- based on where the order is taken. Sorry for the -- it might add a little bit of complexity but it provides a little bit more information to do it those 2 ways. Okay. I guess, if you\\'ll fundamentally the view the demand environment in China, Bill, how would you sort of look at that outside of the dynamics of that order there disregarded et cetera but what does the fundamental situation there are look like? Is it sequentially worse? Did you do see a similar sort of falling off in July? And what\\'s the view going forward? We\\'ve seen some other competitors have commented on China being weaker than expected, and the recovery likely pushed out into \\'13. So could you give that sort of fundamental color from an Agilent standpoint? Yes. Overall, China is slowing, showed up in our numbers. The big swing factor in China will be wireless manufacturing because 85% of the cell phones in the world are manufactured in China. The rest of our businesses is in the mid single-digit growth rate, which is half of what it was a year ago. It\\'s not going negative, but there is no doubt that China is slowing down as a result of issues particularly in Europe and what we\\'re starting to see in the United States. Okay. And I also wanted to ask you about the investment, the thought process behind investments in the business. In the past, you\\'ve talked about academic and government, just the whole end market being a higher growth potential market for Agilent. And therefore, the investments were higher and we were to expect lower incrementals in the near term. Given all of the challenges we have seen with funding and a slowdown there, has your view changed on sort of the return on investments in that space? And is that a part of the cost savings that you\\'re talking about? Or are the cost savings basically focused on EMG again? Again, the cost savings that we are targeting are in manufacturing. They\\'re not in EMG. EMG has the best gross margins in the company. The focus continues to be on chemical analysis and life science; predominantly, the Varian product lines. And that is what we are focusing on. I\\'ve been very clear. We need to get 5 points of gross margins improvement, and both Mike and Nick through Soon Chai\\'s organization are working on to be able to make that happen. At this point in time, we are not changing our investment portfolio. A company cannot instantaneously jerk a company around for a momentary slowdown. If in fact there\\'s a financial crisis in Europe next year, then we\\'ll deal with that. But we are absolutely committed to continue to invest in research and development, committed to academic and research, committed to ensure that Dako is successful, continue our investment in life science, and of course, be competitive across all the applied markets and electronic markets. Again, we\\'re a company that\\'s been around since 1939, and we will continue to provide our customers the best measurement solutions in the world. So I\\'m trying to get a sense, piggybacking off of what some of the other folks asked. Just on sort of where do you think we are kind of in the contraction and demand? I mean, when we look at sort of the macro, I mean, we\\'ve been seeing PMIs come in for a while. You\\'ve seen guys across the tech space on the customer side sort of have inventory issues and go through a lot of the demand pain and a lot of the high end CapEx guides leveraged Asia, it\\'s been pretty bad. Q3 is -- but we\\'re seeing the market and others sort of imply that we\\'re going to see sort of another side of it. That we\\'ve kind of come down, we followed this path the last few summers and then things sort of get better in the fall, winter. Now I guess I\\'m just trying to get in the context of what\\'s implied in Q4 and vis-à-vis, the reaction you saw from the customers, how you sort of characterize this versus other examples, whether it\\'s regionally or by division and just get a sense for, \"all right, so this is bad but we knew the economies were slowing.\" And so was it that much worse than you would have expected given all the data we saw? And what are we looking for to sort of see the other side of this if we actually could see an improvement in growth at some point? Clearly, that\\'s what the market in and of itself is sort of implying. Well, first of all, the big surprise is that we had a delta change of $50 million of revenue delivery that customers didn\\'t want. Now having been in the industry for a long, long time, this doesn\\'t surprise me whatsoever that when people get nervous about the macroeconomic environment, they slow down spending. 70% of the company is in capital equipment. It\\'s the easiest thing to stop and so that\\'s exactly what happened in the markets that we had outlined. In my opinion, the fundamental issue is that you have economic and political uncertainty in Europe and in the U.S. That\\'s why this is so different in what we\\'ve seen in the past. It\\'s not supply and demand, it\\'s not a normal rescission. But given the issues of the euro and what\\'s going to happen and then you have this financial cliff in the U.S. in January, complete political disagreement in Washington, people are really nervous. And I think that depending on, quite honestly, if you would -- if somebody agreed tomorrow to say that Europe is going to do a euro bond and the U.S. was not going to have a financial cliff in January, you would have a different outlook. I think it\\'s as simple as that. And of course, China, where their number 1 trading partner is Europe, is just going to see the second order effect of what\\'s going on in Europe and the U.S. And I think it\\'s that, and that\\'s why it\\'s so hard to predict what\\'s going to happen. Didier? I would just add that the slowdown, even though it was expected, everybody expected the Q3, Q4 -- Q2, Q3 GDP worldwide to be lower than in Q1, it was more pronounced. I mean when we guided in May, the PMI new order index was at its highest for some -- for awhile, and then it dropped to being the lowest since 2009. So it was fairly sudden because of the factors that Bill has mentioned. And it\\'s not something that even though we are conservative and we are careful -- and on top of that, to date, people say, \"well, worldwide GDP is going to be 3.1% growth for Q2, Q3.\" From our standpoint, when you look at our models and our correlations to GDP, it feels a lot more than 2.5% and 3.1%. So I\\'m not even sure that the numbers that people are expecting will really, really materialize. I think they are probably going to be revised down in the next few weeks. So I guess, do you think to some degree on a relative basis in your peers, in terms of how the performance just aesthetically looks, obviously you have an exposure to a couple areas that they don\\'t, like on aerospace, defense, which was weaker. But on the sort of traditional tools businesses, do you think the function of the timing of the quarter in that July was net worse and we\\'ll see this sort of play out in 3Q more broadly from a demand perspective? Or were there other things sort of specific to some of the product lines or some of the end markets where you touched that you saw sort of an exaggerated -- sort of delta versus expect relative to everyone else. I think you outlined the 2 issues. First of all, we had the extra month. So if you believe the macroeconomic environment is slowing greater than in July versus June, then that would impact us differently than our peers who are typically on a calendar quarter. And secondly is that if you do a weighted average growth of our peers, we grew slightly less than them. But we have much higher exposure to aerospace and defense and industrial. A lot of them have much greater exposure to academic and research, but the industrial and aerospace and defense is 18% of the company. So the areas where we\\'ve had strong market positions clearly, we saw the most headwinds in Q3. Okay. And I guess just last point, I just want to get this clear on Dako because I feel like there\\'s a lot of a bit of cross nets [ph] here. In terms of how you\\'re thinking about sort of the revenue opportunity there from the synergies perspective versus the original, are we sort of in the same place? Or are we moderately worse? I guess, it isn\\'t clear to me kind of in terms of how you\\'re thinking about the total return equation there, kind of what the all in sort of conclusion is, having owned this now for a couple months. Well, we\\'re not going to overplay. We\\'re off to a great start. July was the best month in Dako\\'s history. And as Lars said, there are going to be ups and downs. The data and the forecast is that we are at or above what we told everyone to justify the acquisition. On the other hand, we are only at the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do. And the good news is it wasn\\'t bad news, which often happens in an acquisition, but we won\\'t be bragging about it until we get a couple years into leveraging the capability of Dako and Agilent together. That\\'s really where the proof in the pudding is going to be, to be able to get the return on the investments we had made. But we\\'re off to a very, very good start. I appreciate some of the color you\\'ve given on guidance. As we think about cash flow, though, can you, Didier, maybe update us on how you think about cash flow guidance for the remainder of the year? Do you still think you can do north of $1 billion for the year? Yes. No chance, $1.1 billion is our operating cash flow minus about $200 million of CapEx, so $900 million net. Okay. And then, Bill, relative to your own expectations for the quarter, can you help us think about how much of the delta was Europe versus Asia relative to your own internal expectations? It was mostly market segment just as we had defined. Again, we tend to look at business by company and by market, because most of the companies are so multi international. And then as Didier said, we sort of add it up at the end about what region got what orders and what revenue. But again, the surprise was the slowdown in orders and the unwillingness of customers to take delivery. I mean, that was the issue. And again, you add in $50 million back into our revenue number, we wouldn\\'t be having this conversation. And it all showed up at the end of July. And again, as any capital equipment company, all the shipments tend to be biased to the last month of the quarter and we could not get customer acceptance. Okay. And then as we think about kind of the diagnostics in genomics business, I think Dako was more or less in line with our estimates overall, because that division was a little bit late light relative to what we were expecting. Did you see a slowdown in genomics? And can you kind of comment on some of the underlying trends there? Yes. The quarter for the genomics was slightly below expectation in Q3. However, they\\'re going to be able to make that up in Q4. So again, I think we\\'re going to be in fine shape. It\\'s just the seasonality of the quarter on how deliveries are being done there. Obviously, they\\'re impacted the most by academic and research. They had some negative. The continue -- there\\'s a fair amount of pressure on the gene partitioning. It had a sequencing. On the flip side of it is, as I said, the acceptance of our new probe technology has been great. I mean, the number of customers has increased dramatically moving forward. We\\'re introducing this technology through the Dako sales team, and so we\\'re really quite reasonably optimistic as we move into Q4 in terms of our new growth -- our new group diagnostics and genomics group. We\\'re quite optimistic. And lastly, can you talk on price? Are you able to kind of hold price in this environment with some of the delays? Or do you have to see some slippage across the board on price? In this environment, there is a lot of pricing pressure across every one of our segments moving forward. And that\\'s why, as we had outlined, we are very aggressive on moving after manufacturing. We\\'re not signing it up. It\\'s following all the bottom line, because quite frankly, a lot of that work that Ron\\'s team is focusing on is going to offset some of the pricing pressure that we\\'re seeing. Bill, I guess we\\'re really trying to sort out what the earnings will be like this time around versus \\'08, \\'09 and the start of that. Within this pie chart showing industrial computers and semis is 20% of Agilent in the quarter, is most of that now industrial? And how do you think that industrial market will be this time around? Like what was it like in \\'09? Will industrial have a lower trough compared to your semiconductor computer that you saw in \\'09? Yes. The difference between today and \\'09, I mean, are not the same. Because in \\'09, there was lack of liquidity, there was lack of cash and people just stopped spending capital equipment. Right now, people are starting to be conservative because, first of all, 2009 is very real in their memory. And two, all you have to do is read the newspaper every day, and the lack of progress in Europe, the lack of progress in Washington causes people to not want to spend. If you look at the consumer savings rate, it\\'s gone up 1 point in the United States already. So if there is a euro crash of some sort, you will see, in my opinion, a replay of 2009. Right now, there is no evidence of a replay of 2009 at all. It\\'s a very hard one to call because I think people are just waiting to see what happens because of the lack of clear government policy. And I guess that gets to the cyclicality issue. Again, is it more industrial that you see in that sector? Or is it also the computer semiconductors? I wanted to understand the lab environment a little bit better and how the labs are thinking about the consumables that you\\'re selling to them versus the capital equipment. Can you talk a little bit about the product lines that were hit the biggest and how consumables played out in the quarter? So first, I mean, for my comment, then I\\'ll turn this over to Mike for his consumables comment, but for my comment, the LC business was pretty soft. We had a situation in LC where the overall growth in revenue was negative although the orders were positive, but that business was pretty soft quarter-over-quarter. Mass spec continues to be positive both on orders and revenue. So it is more that routine replacement subset that we\\'re seeing some softness in. And the rest of the businesses where it\\'s a technology upgrade, we\\'re still seeing strength. And that\\'s true, obviously more for pharma than academic. The academic problem was pretty regional. It was very much U.S. and Europe, not rest of world. And, Mike, if you want to talk about the consumable piece. Yes, sure, Nick. And just to continue the similar dialogue here. As Nick pointed out, on the LC side, replacement cycle, we saw a similar phenomena on the Gas Chromatography side in terms of replacement. But as we pointed out, some of the new higher end products are really continuing to grow quite well. Relative to consumables, we\\'re still seeing interest in the ongoing operations of funding those by our customers and saw growth in our consumables business in line with our peers. And as a follow-up, when you talk about China LSG and CAG growing mid single digits, do you think that mid single digit gets worse going forward? How do you think that plays out in Life Sciences for China going forward? Yes,. I think the market in China for life science continues to be a market that\\'s going to grow above their GDP rate, and that\\'s because it\\'s a place that they\\'re investing in their 5-year plan, so I think the market macro looks pretty decent. And you just have to look at their GDP and add a bit. We obviously are seeing a lot of competitors and we\\'re big in China, so we\\'re adjusting our footprint and our behavior to make sure that we stay at or above the market rate, and that\\'s a challenge for us. But the market itself looks pretty good. So just to tease out that last piece, is it completion that had the bigger impact this quarter? Or is it macro? Which 1 of the 2 for China life sciences? Relative to the CAG side, as Bill pointed out in his comments, we had solid single digit revenue growth for the quarter. And we would not expect to see a slowing from that growth rate as we move forward. What we did see in the quarter was really some level of uncertainty in the customer base, obviously, from some of the economic concerns that we\\'ve been talking about today. But also, in the run up to the leadership changes that we\\'ll be trying later this year. And our competitive position in terms of share remains very solid. A couple questions on the EMG piece of the business. The Communications piece is up 7%. Did we see any broadening of the strength there outside of the handset test business? Or was all of the strength kind of concentrated there? Have we see anything come back on the base station side or... So to answer this, we did not see changes on the base station in infrastructure compared to what we said last quarter, so this is staying at the low side. We have seen strength of our costs to overall wireless manufacturing segment and also the R&D part of the wireless handset. But you also saw, Guy, negative growth on the optical test side, which was quite substantial. That was really the big news buried in the numbers, is a very substantial cutback in optical test. Okay. And then just one maybe longer-term question, but there\\'s been an announcement, big service provider here in the U.S. talking about kind of phasing out their legacy 2G network. This is out to the 2016, \\'17 timeframe. But I\\'m curious, does that suggest an accelerated spend then in LTE and -- or what would you expect to be the impact on phasing out the legacy 2G spend but then accelerating impact on the LTE? Is that generally speaking a positive for sales and margins acceleration or... I don\\'t know if Guy of Ron have a different opinion. My view on this, and we went through the whole change from analog to G2, G3, G4, that the market doesn\\'t move that fast. And so at least based on the last 10 years data, one wouldn\\'t see an abnormal change in overall investment. But, Guy, Ron? Yes. I would really concur with what you said, Bill, is that the CapEx that we\\'re going to invest is not really changing. It\\'s just shifting, okay? Shifting. It is more -- I would say the positive is at the R&D side, because obviously, more investment going into additional LTE investment in designing. And potentially for LTE-Advanced, so there\\'s more and more need for what they call carrier aggregation to make the most of the network and the bandwidth they have, so that\\'s where I would see the positive signs. Again an EMG. So what are you seeing as far as comm orders going into 4Q? Did you see a hit there in 3Q? Or are you seeing kind of a steady-state continuation of the kind of mid high single-digit growth? Well, going forward, I would say there, the sequential, especially on the manufacturing side, we expect this to moderate slightly in Q4. As you know, there are cycles for some of this production and the time where some of these devices go to market. So that\\'s probably the comment I could do for Q4. Okay. It bounces along the bottom. And then can you comment on the -- you mentioned that there was weakness in the distribution channel. Do you have a view of sell-in versus sell-through, amount of de-stocking versus in demand there and where you think inventories are? Yes. We are very rigorous on managing our distribution inventory. And we track that very well. And so, there\\'s no evidence -- Ron, correct me if I\\'m wrong, of any build up in our distribution division channel. And, yes, we take credit when we ship to them in revenue, but we watch the sell-through very well just to ensure that we\\'re not exposed. I guess, first, for Didier, a question on gross margin. If we look at wireless manufacturing test tools kind of be at elevated levels as a portion of mix, and if we look at the $50 million in orders that haven\\'t really shipped in the quarter and then we take into account inventory being somewhat elevated, should we expect inventory to be worked through in the coming quarter? And consequently, expect some margin pressure perhaps with gross margin declining sequentially? No. You would expect we had a strong wireless manufacturing test business in Q3. And as you noted, it comes with a lower gross margin than the average. In Q4, you would expect a sequential increase in gross margin. And by the way, also a slight sequential increase in operating margin also. And I do believe there\\'s some opportunity to reduce inventory, but most of the inventory growth sequentially is the result of the inclusion of Dako. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And I guess, you discussed aerospace and defense being a little bit weak. You discussed that you\\'re seeing a little bit of, I guess, order softness you think because of the worry about a fiscal cliff. But as you guys sit here and you kind of do your roundtables and you look at the aerospace and defense business and you think about, I guess a range of expectations that could happen with sequestration, how do you look at that business playing out in 2013? I realize it could be a wide range but if you could kind of just give us a thought process of potential outcomes. I have been very public about this that one of the big risk factors to Agilent is aerospace and defense segment of the business, which at that time, is 10% of the company. Now it\\'s down to 8% of the company. We are coming off a record high investment over the last number of decades in aerospace and defense. With awards winding down, the desire to cut an additional $50 billion. The sequestering, as you said, is another $50 billion. If that happens, I believe that Agilent is going to be impacted. The only offsetting can be what type of programs are still funded. The issue is that once there\\'s that magnitude of a cut, everything just comes to a screeching halt until people decide what programs they are going to fund moving forward. Guy and the team, of course, are trying to get more business outside of the United States. We\\'re shipping into operational surveillance. We obviously continue to focus on radar systems and guidance. But if the financial cliff happens in January, I think that you\\'re going to see a major impact to U.S. defense spending. And as we said in our notes, the government spending hasn\\'t changed much, not too surprisingly. It\\'s the prime contractors that are already cutting back in anticipation of a major cut in defense spending. That\\'s what we saw and it happened faster than we had anticipated. And Bill, as you kind of look at the big picture, there any businesses outside of aerospace and defense, maybe getting into academia and government that you think could also see some of the negative impact of those potential outcomes? Every one of our segments that have high government spending are at risk of having pressure. Start with the local governments, no money, go to state level, state-by-state, go to countries, anything that we touch. And we saw it in this last quarter. aerospace and defense and environmental testing was below expectation. We know what the number is overall. I mean we\\'ve never provided that level of detail. But I think Mike and the team, and Guy\\'s team know exactly where the opportunities are in each -- by country, by region, province and by state. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And I guess just one more, maybe for Didier. As you kind of move into this sluggish macro environment and you kind of are in the process of digesting Dako, how should we think about your willingness to lever your balance sheet? Are we in kind of a cash replenishment cycle? Are you guys still actively looking for the right opportunity? Or do you think that your product portfolio is in essence where you need it to be at this point? Well, we\\'re always looking at opportunities for either bolt-on acquisitions or something. Or obviously, there\\'s no way we\\'re going to do anything in the short term considering we want to declare a victory on Dako before we become more aggressive, the same way as we\\'ve done with Varian. But certainly, the driver is not the availability of cash or how cheap interest rates would be if we do a bond offering. It\\'s just what opportunities are we seeing to create shareholder value. And right now, we are entirely focused on making sure we create the committed shareholder value in Dako. In the meantime, there could be small bolt-on acquisitions, but nothing big in the short term. First off would be on book-to-bill this quarter, can you maybe give us a sense of how that looks in the aggregate? And then also split it out between the EMG side and maybe the rest of the business? Yes. You have the information on our vital -- on all our documents. You have the order and revenue in all the schedules that we provided. This is the message. I mean this is again, at this point in time, the softness we saw was in EMG and in Chemical Analysis. Chemical Analysis related to government spending. Life Science actually did overall did reasonably well even with the pressure in academic and research. And obviously, Dako was a huge benefit to the company. But it is not a massive change in one segment versus the other at this point in time. Sure, okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, Nick, maybe, if I could ask a question about China to follow up on the earlier one regarding the government funding there. I think a lot of the other companies in the industry have been talking about waiting on a lot of the new government officials get into place, start releasing budgets. Some of that has been expected to show up in the back half of this calendar year. I\\'m just wondering if you could maybe comment on your expectations for those government dollars to start flowing at some point later this year. Yes, we think the comment is -- let me just say, I can pretty much validate the comment. They are putting a lot of new officials in place. There\\'s a question on government hand over. But in terms of when you get down into the bioanalytical sector and certainly Life Science, there\\'s a lot of money that is in principle committed and is yet to be committed by the actual end researcher at the National Academy. And we expect that to occur in the next few months. Great. And maybe a last question if I could on the long-term picture. Didier and Bill, can you maybe remind us what kind of a global GDP growth assumption you guys bake into your views? Because you guys obviously have your sort of foundation call for 8% core growth. I\\'m just wondering what kind of underlying GDP growth you think you need to hit that number on a multiyear base. Okay. And so just last there, is it fair to say if we look into a multiyear period where 4.5% looks difficult, would you guys maybe revisit the long-term guidance number? Absolutely. If we don\\'t believe in the 4.5%, absolutely. Right now, it is the consensus estimate. And I can tell you there\\'s a lot of debates in-house whether are economists smoking something or what are the downside risks. But right now, it is the consensus estimate. It\\'s the ISM number. It\\'s all the various bankers, economists are still going for this kind of ongoing secular growth rate for the worldwide GDP, with obviously emerging economies being growth engine. The message is, if in fact as predicted that the worldwide economy grows next year at 3.8%, we\\'re going to do fine. I mean Agilent has done a great job to be able to respond to market opportunities anywhere in the world. The big issue is nobody really knows what is going to happen. I would submit the fundamental issue is the issues in Europe and the United States. So the Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis gross margin -- not gross margin, operating margins improved nicely sequentially and -- which is impressive, certainly, in Chemical Analysis, given that the organic revenue growth is weaker. What happened quarter-to-quarter on that? Ron, why don\\'t you talk about some of the things that we\\'re doing from an order fulfillment standpoint to, again, meet our commitment to improve the gross margins by 5 percentage points? You may remember that back in November, we announced that we created an Agilent order fulfillment organization, and that\\'s to leverage $1.7 billion OF organization. They\\'re focusing on 3 particular areas. The first one is our overall manufacturing cost of actually putting together products and where products are made, and there\\'s some minor consolidations that are going on of locations for that piece. The second piece is to use one integrated supply chain, which can get the best sourcing possible. And that is located in Asia, where we had the EMG supply chain in the past. And the third is to lower our logistics costs. And all 3 of those areas are being used to leverage our capability across all of the businesses. And again, that is what\\'s driving the gross margin improvements in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis. As Bill had mentioned, there is some pricing pressure that shows up in the gross margin line less than it shows up in actual COGS dollars or a little bit more slowly, but the progress has been exceptional. So if you kind of look at a scenario where you\\'ve got sort of these improvement programs in place and the economy kind of muddles along for the foreseeable future, did I hear you correctly in that scenario that a flat year-over-year operating margin or an operating margins, say, in the 20% range is what you think is achievable? And then just one final throwaway question on this. On the CAG business, how did vacuum -- I would assume you got a bigger hit from the vacuum business, the old Varian vacuum businesses in there. Was that disproportionately down relative to some of the analytical and instrumentation businesses? In the current environment, I know Bill and Didier, you addressed this in a couple of points in the call, but I\\'m itching to get your take kind of overall. But how is management balancing making strategic investments versus being more aggressive on the variable cost side to protect earnings? Given, I think, the experience in \\'08 and \\'09, you certainly have taken a lot of fixed costs out. But just kind of looking ahead, like how hard are you pressing on that variable cost line today in order to kind of get to those fourth quarter numbers? This is the power of the operating margin or operating model that we have. I mean, a lot of the variable costs that you\\'ve already seen are automatically built into the system moving forward. Ron and the team of course are looking at all this discretionary spending, focusing the investment on where we can drive shorter-term opportunities. But in a muddle forward scenario of low growth, I have the highest confidence that we can continue to invest in technology that the market demands and not exercise the organization such a way that we\\'re distracting people from being the best company to do business with in our market segment. And so, again, we have a lot of flexibility. Obviously, the Dako inclusion and the continued growth in this is obviously very, very helpful for us in this environment. And barring a major economic reset, I think that within our framework, we can in fact deliver this 20% operating profit on essentially flat growth. And then kind of following up on the question earlier, but in terms of more near term, saying you\\'re looking at the fourth quarter, does your guidance imply, like can you give us some guideposts there? Just kind of broadly speaking, say PMI is the number that Didier focused on early on in the call, but is there something where -- is there kind of a range of estimates that you\\'ve looked at, that you feel comfortable with maybe on some of the macro indicators in terms of reaching your fourth quarter guidance? How we do it, it\\'s more mundane than that. We know what the backlog is, we know what the order pattern was in Q3. Historically, Q4, the orders are the highest for the year. In our guidance, we assume that was not going to happen, that we would see a replay of Q3 in Q4, so that\\'s the baseline revenue. So we know what the order turns are, we know the forecasts are, we know what the funnel is, but we took a position saying we have a backlog, we assume that the pushouts and deliveries weren\\'t going to show up in Q4, that, that phenomenon would continue. And that -- as a result of that, you\\'re seeing a flat organic growth rate from Q3 to Q4, then we get the benefit of Dako on top of that. That\\'s how we determined our guidance. Great. And then maybe one more. Just Asia x Japan, since -- sorry, Asia x China, sorry. But China certainly had some strong growth in the quarter, although the base decelerated, as you mentioned. But outside of China, can you just comment, were there any particular big countries that experienced more significant weakness are not? Just any color on kind of what you\\'re seeing there would be helpful. Japan minus 10%. And India, with all the currency fluctuations, we saw some purchasing folks that were delaying, trying to play the currency better. But other than that, it was relatively consistent. And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. And I would now like to hand the call back over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, Caris. And this concludes our call for today. I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. Thanks, again. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\\'s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Derek, and I\\'ll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor relations. Please proceed. Thank you, Derek, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s Fourth Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2012. With me are Agilent\\'s CEO, Bill Sullivan, as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s President and Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian. Also joining are the presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Life Sciences, Chemical Analysis and Diagnostics and Genomics Groups, Guy Sene, Nick Roelofs, Mike McMullen and Lars Holmkvist. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there please click on the link for financial results, where you will find revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Bill and Didier\\'s comments today will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. For Agilent\\'s fiscal fourth quarter, orders were flat year-over-year, while Q4 revenues were up 2% over last year. Operating margin was almost 22%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86 per share. The headline for this quarter is that most of our end markets remain soft. As a result of executing on our operating model we improved gross margins, tightly controlled our expenses to deliver a record non-GAAP operating profit, exceeded our EPS guidance and strengthened our balance sheet as a result of excellent free cash flow. We are pleased with our financial results for the quarter, as we have rebounded from our Q3 earnings miss. In regards to end markets, Q4 played out as predicted. Fourth quarter revenue, excluding Dako, was flat compared to Q3. Electronic Measurement revenues declined 5% over last year. Communication markets were down in high-single digits with softness in R&D and manufacturing. Aerospace and defense spending was down 2% year-over-year. All of our Chemical Analysis markets remained soft except for Forensic, testing for drugs of abuse, with overall business revenues down 3% year-over-year. Our Life Science business was flat compared to previous year as we continue to see positive growth for Pharma and continued weakness in academic and research. Overall organic growth in our new Diagnostics and Genomics business was slightly up year-over-year. Dako met its fourth quarter revenue plan and continues to deliver on our expectations. Looking ahead for the fiscal -- full fiscal year 2013, Agilent expects revenue of $7 billion to $7.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.80 to $3.10 per share. Forecasting the outlook for FY \\'13 is difficult, especially in the face of a potential U.S. financial or fiscal cliff. However, we would like to share the thinking that supports our FY \\'13 guidance. First, we\\'re assuming there will be no new financial crisis in the United States or Europe. However, continued uncertainty will dampen demand until the second half of our fiscal year. Second, Agilent will face higher pension expenses and the traditional increases in compensation and benefits. These costs will be less easily absorbed in a slow growth environment. We continue to deliver on our ambitious manufacturing cost improvement plan. However, we\\'re also facing price competition again because of the current slow growth environment. Overall, we are forecasting an FY \\'13 core revenue growth rate in the range of plus or minus 1.5%. Total reported revenue growth, including the impact of acquisitions, is expected to be in the 2% to 5% range. In regards to business segments, we\\'re forecasting a 1% to 3% decline in our Electronic Measurement business. We are not counting on increased investments in cellular infrastructure in the first half. Our Chemical Analysis and Life Science businesses will be flat to up to 3% with no fundamental changes in end markets. For our Diagnostics and Genomics business, core growth to be in the range of 3% to 7%, with Dako growing around 3 -- 6%. Finally, we will continue our investments in R&D. We will ensure that we continue to meet customers\\' needs with innovative and cost-effective solutions to solve their most critical measurement challenges. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As Bill stated, we are quite pleased with our fourth quarter results. Revenues were in line with our guidance, and our operating margin reached a record high of 21.7%, a noteworthy performance in a challenging economic environment. We delivered substantial sequential and year-over-year improvements in gross margin, thanks to varying cost synergies and other cost-saving programs in CAG and LSG. We also maintained the strict operating expense controls implemented 6 months ago. Reflecting on our performance for the full year, we reached a record 20.2% operating margin on 2.5% core revenue growth. Our core revenue growth was close to the low end of the guidance we provided in November of last year, but our all-time high $3.12 EPS, including $0.04 from Dako standalone, was $0.12 above the low end of the guidance. We generated over $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, $100 million more than the guidance provided 1 year ago. Now turning to the guidance for fiscal year 2013. As Bill stated, our fiscal year \\'13 revenue guidance of $7 billion to $7.2 billion assumes the economy will muddle through in the first half of our fiscal year and pick up moderately in the second half. We do not assume a fiscal cliff scenario, but do expect stringent government spending. The $2.80 to $3.10 EPS guidance takes into account year-over-year increases in compensation and benefits of $100 million, as well as an increase in sales commissions of $15 million as quarters are being reset, offset by variable pay reduction, cost synergies and the incremental Dako standalone operating profit contribution of about $30 million. At the low end of the revenue guidance, one would also expect a tougher price environment. As you update your models for fiscal year \\'13, please consider the following. Annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2012. Stock-based compensation will be about $90 million compared to $76 million in fiscal year \\'12. And as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $32 million. Pension expenses will grow from $70 million in fiscal year \\'12 to $85 million in fiscal year \\'13. Depreciation is projected to be $195 million for the fiscal year. Net interest expense is forecasted at $95 million, and other income at $15 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is assumed to remain at 16% and the diluted share count at 355 million shares. And we expect operating cash flow of $1.25 billion and capital expenditures of $220 million. Now finally moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion and EPS of $0.65 to $0.67. As a reminder, we typically see EPS decline materially from Q4 to Q1 because of the impact of the December salary increase, front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to disbursement of the variable incentive pay of the previous semester. So, Bill, obviously we\\'ve got 4 more years here to look forward to of somewhat less accommodating tax policy. At what point does the board -- do you sit down and rip the Band-Aid off, so to speak, so you can put in place kind of a more formulaic capital deployment plan given your tax situation today? Well, I think that our fundamental tenets in terms of looking on capital deployment has not changed. Our #1 priority continues to be investing in the businesses as we have done. Secondly is to tax effectively, return excess cash to the shareholders. We\\'ve done that through stock repurchase, as well as paying for a dividend. And so I don\\'t believe that there\\'ll be any fundamental change whatsoever. And I don\\'t understand why one would deliberately not maximize your balance sheet to ensure the health and -- the health of the company going forward. Understood. So, Didier, why not put in more of a buyback or a capital deployment event to 2013? From what I understand, you\\'ve got some $500 million or so coming back tax efficiently. What have you assumed in terms of your marketing that U.S. cash for next year? Yes, I mean we intend to continue on the kind of programs that we\\'ve had since the last 3 years. As a reminder, in fiscal year \\'10, we bought back $411 million of shares, fiscal \\'11 $497 million, this year $172 million. We\\'ve maintained our basic share count of 346 million shares. We do have opportunities, potentially to bring -- to put some of the money we did bring back, by the way, on November 5 as permitted to good use in the U.S. through potentially acquisitions, small acquisitions. We spend about $200 million every year on small acquisitions, and we will continue to do regular buybacks as per above the average of what we have done in the last 3 years. So we will put the $500-plus million to Q3. In terms of the projected share count, I mean it\\'s always difficult. It\\'s so much influenced by the stock price, and I think it\\'s difficult to [indiscernible], so it\\'s just what to -- what we think, I mean it\\'s just a nice round number. And the board fully supports our fundamental position that we will remain investment grade. We will make prudent acquisitions to drive success for the company. We\\'ll do everything possible to tax effectively return excess cash to the shareholders. It appears that you are guiding us to model about 100 to 150-basis-point decline in the operating margin, is that right, Didier? And if so, is that all mix? And some of the other items that you called out on the call, are there areas of -- other areas that we should be thinking about where you are making investments this year? Yes, I mean, the -- we are -- in the range that we have provided, at the low end -- at the high end of the range, we are pretty much aligned with kind of gross margins -- I mean, this year\\'s results. But at the low end yes, indeed, that assumes that there will be a tougher pricing environment and a corresponding potential hit to the bottom line. Fundamentally, at essentially 0 organic growth rate being the middle of our range, we\\'re not going to get the leverage. We felt at this point in time, given the economic uncertainty, that to make any sort of restructuring charge to make up the difference is not prudent. Secondly, to back away from our investment in emerging markets, to back away from the investment we\\'re making in Dako, to back away from any investment we\\'re making in research and development is not the prudent thing to do. We are having very, very solid forecast in uncertain economic times and I believe that we not only need to be well positioned today, we need to make sure that we\\'re well positioned for the future. Okay. That\\'s all very helpful. And one follow-up. How did the expectations that you factored into 2013 guidance for Dako compare to those outlined at the time you closed the acquisition? Specifically, is the deal tracking below plan, ahead of plan? I think you had talked about moving towards market growth and for revenue of $0.33 in the -- or so or above $0.30 in the first full year of revenue. We\\'re about a quarter and a half into that. So just wondering what you factored into guidance. So the fundamental core business of Dako continues right on plan. We continue to make the investment in Asia. Those revenues are slightly behind plan. The investment in selling SureFISH through their product line is going well in terms of number of customers. We\\'re not quite yet getting a high enough reorder rate to hit the -- linearly on track to what we had said. We obviously have lots of time ahead of us. This is going to be a multi-year effort to be able to drive the value of Dako. But we are very, very pleased with the progress that we\\'ve made today, very pleased with the integration. And as I said, the core business of Dako continues to recover as originally outlined. Just wanted to ask you about -- Bill, you\\'re kind of down 1.5% to plus 1.5% for DD&A kind of guidance for fiscal \\'13. What type of environment, I know that you envision, I know you lay that quantitatively, but it seems to be still kind of a breakage maybe with the model in terms of the economic growth and what type of organic growth you would achieve versus that? I\\'m just trying to kind of reconcile the 2. Well, it\\'s very, very difficult to give guidance in this environment right now. We often joke it’d be a lot better to give guidance after decisions were made on Washington and how the financial cliff was going to be dealt with. But what we have done with each of the group presidents and Ron have gone to -- into each one of the groups, market-by-market to try to make a balance estimate of where we see the overall business. We believe that with the political uncertainty in Europe and the U.S., that you\\'re going to see a pretty flat growth rate. People are hesitating. It\\'s a model forward, as Didier said. And so as a result of that, you give the pluses and minuses of our market segments, which really haven\\'t changed in Q3. You can easily come into an environment of relatively low growth. Our operating model obviously doesn\\'t get the incremental when you\\'re outside of our range or bottom end of our range of 4%. And then the question comes in as do you restructure the company now to force ourselves back into the model or do we continue making the right investment for the future. And we have made the decision to continue to make the proper investments to the future while continually to focus on improving our manufacturing cost of sales or manufacturing footprint and overall productivity. Great. And maybe just one related to that. Just in terms of EMG specifically, which you think that was the big fear in the quarter, but it looks like it kind of came in close to kind of expectations. Can you just set the pace of what you saw throughout the quarter, maybe as you ended the quarter, the down 7% in orders, just kind of what do you -- kind of how are you thinking about that going forward? Well, we had a bit of state defense, as we expected sequential growth over last quarter but still under last year. And in general, all our market segment were low. Remember, the overall communication industry is lower in Q4, and that\\'s what we -- what happened in this last quarter or so. So very consistent with our expectation. Okay, in terms of the orders down 7%, that was, I mean that wasn\\'t -- I mean that kind of was consistent with the way you guys were seeing in the world? As Guy alluded to, a lot of the orders and revenue that we have recognized tends to be ahead of the holiday season, and the team has done a great job of delivering those orders. And typically, you will see it soft in Q4 and potentially soft in Q1, depending what the inventory carryover is from the holidays. Maybe just one more to sneak in. Didier, on the pension expense, can you just kind of highlight specifically, I know you kind of called that out, but how much does that factor in to kind of the $2.80 to $3.10? How should we think about that increased kind of investment in the pension plan? So in terms of the -- I mean, we are very well funded overall with our pension plan. But we were impacted by a significant reduction year-over-year on discount rates, which basically imply that our liabilities went up. Our return on assets for the fiscal year \\'12 was very good, better than our expected return on assets. But net-net, that resulted in an unexpected because we cannot forecast pension expenses. It all depends on what happens on the last day of the fiscal year. So we saw a $15 million increase, and now we\\'re all set for the fiscal year \\'13. That\\'s about $0.03 of EPS. I guess just first briefly, Bill, is there any change to the ROIC targets for fiscal year \\'13 in terms of the variable pay? No. As you know, this year we raised the return on investment capital target from 21% to 25%, and there\\'s no change in that number going forward. Okay. So that stays that way for \\'13. And there\\'s -- to be clear on Dako, I think you had guided for \\'13 I think $0.35 of accretion. I don\\'t know if you can do it this way, either maybe Didier or Bill, but if you, like, take each of your segments, can you maybe and do a walk, you did $3.12 in earnings this year. Could you maybe kind of just help us think through the -- you have Dako, it sounds like you said $30 million in operating profits I think if I\\'m doing my math right, you\\'re talking about like $0.07, and then maybe some of the decrementals that you\\'re expecting in the other business segments? Yes, it\\'s a little difficult. Yes, I was -- $30 million increase in operating profit for Dako between 2012 and 2013. For the rest, the operating margins, as answered previously, are the high end of our guidance are similar to what we have seen in 2012 on the relatively flat revenue growth. Again, I would say that it is -- our high end of the range is about 1.5% core revenue growth for the business, and at the low end minus 1.5%. But there\\'s not a fundamental -- I mean, I didn\\'t calculate the incremental corresponding because that, at 0% core revenue growth, it\\'s very difficult to calculate the incrementals. But we are really, really, really operating very -- not only in line with our operating model, but even, in fact, better than what we committed to when you think that we\\'ve reached a record operating margin both for the quarter and for the year on the -- only 2%, 2.5% core revenue growth that is way better than what we committed to in our operating model. So I guess if we think about there\\'s pretty narrow range of core growth. I think you said, right, minus 1.5% to plus 1.5%? I mean if you -- it sounds like what you were saying, Bill, in terms of restructuring, I mean if you do anything -- I mean but it looks like it\\'s a fairly wide range in terms of kind of where the margin could come in. But so if you\\'re going to be flat for the year, don\\'t expect that given what your plan is today, that you would be able to keep flat margins year-over-year. Is that kind of the message just sort of to be clear? Right now, without us restructuring and because of the increased cost of DD&A outline, we\\'ll be roughly at a 19% operating profit. At this point in time, we will not restructure to make up the difference. And so that is [indiscernible]. Last question, I mean, Bill, what would you need to see in order to say, \"Okay, let\\'s actually take a little bit of a deeper step here?\" I think you\\'d have to have, first of all, you\\'d have to see a negative growth in the business moving forward, and that negative growth would happen beyond a year. Typically restructuring costs, enormous amount of money, enormously disruptive for the company. And to do something like that, we would have to ensure that the return it would be better than -- you get your return for making that -- those cuts within a year. So you\\'d have to see a fair amount larger drop in business, and the duration would have to be beyond a year or at least forecasted beyond a year. An additional comment on the 19%. This is on the overall Agilent business, including Dako, which still has, especially with investments that we\\'ve committed to make, a lower operating margin than the rest of Agilent. We\\'re very close to upholding our business, our margins quite high in a slow growth environment. And obviously if, in fact, that we are wrong, economy does recover and I always joke if we had a budget resolution in Washington a Eurobond and $0.5 trillion Chinese stimulus, our view might be a lot different. We\\'re still going to be able to get the type of leverage that we\\'ve got in the past. Bill, in your comments, you commented on the pricing environment a number of times. Can you just talk about where you\\'re experiencing some of the greatest pressures, and whether you get a little bit more aggressive on price going forward? Any big deal where the customer is getting multiple bids from all of our competitors, we\\'re going to have pricing pressure moving forward. We\\'ve actually done a very good job this year of holding our discounts across the company. Again, we measure those. But as Didier said and I have said, if you go in to an environment of slow growth, you just don\\'t have as much leverage in terms of the overall pricing. And so to not assume that there\\'s going to be some downward pressure I think would be unrealistic, and that\\'s the message that we\\'re conveying. And then in your comment a minute ago, you joked about China stimulus. But can you just talk about whether you\\'re expecting a reacceleration in China over the coming year? And how much of that will be EMG versus Life Sciences and other areas? So right now in China, EMG is down because that\\'s where most of the end communication test equipment ends up. As it stands now, and Guy can correct me, that the G4 standard in China is now not going to even be approved until March. And so I believe there\\'s not going to be a lot of growth in the first half of the year. Our overall analytical business in terms of Chemical Analysis and Life Science, the revenue is modest this quarter. The good news was that the orders themselves were in the teens. And as I said, we continue to leverage our infrastructure for Dako\\'s products inside of China. So given all the issues in the world, China is still the #1 story and one could imagine that if our order trend continues that China could, in fact, see a pickup, particularly in the second half of the year. And then maybe last one for Didier. As we think about the guidance, are you baking in extra conservatism here given the experience you had in 2012? If you could just talk about the philosophy behind guidance, if you will? Right, it\\'s -- I mean it\\'s tough to say that we\\'re either conservative or not. I mean we look at the -- in terms of the GDP projections that our guidance is anchored on, we\\'re assuming that flat GDP growth at about 3% until at least the end of the first calendar quarter. So that\\'s basically going into our third fiscal year -- fiscal quarter, and then going up slightly 3.4% from that. So it\\'s really we\\'re assuming more of the same of what we have seen in the last quarter or 2 for the next 2 quarters and then potentially a little bit of an improvement. There\\'s no doubt that as we\\'ve said many times, our -- when we provide a guidance range, I mean as executives, our target incentive is based on at least the highest -- the high end of the guidance, but that doesn\\'t mean in itself that it\\'s -- there\\'s a level of conservatism. I mean we\\'re setting the bar at the right level for executives. So I guess if we sort of take everything together that\\'s happened, I mean the global economy has obviously been challenging, and that\\'s made your core difficult to grow from an EBIT perspective. And then we have all these moving parts. It seems like the new numbers, probably from what most of us were expecting in terms of the outcome, were more so around through the pension expense in the comp. I guess as you\\'re sort of stepping back, it was a busy year. You guys have a fairly big acquisition. It\\'s a tough environment. You\\'re looking at an equity that\\'s been sort of in this level in the mid to high-30s for quite a while going back, x sort of the period where we used to press in \\'08, \\'09. What do you feel like from like a market perspective in terms of what the stock is telling you given all of this mix? I mean what -- how are you -- what are you most focused on? I mean when you step back and you say, \"You know what, I need to keep investing in the business, I don\\'t need to do more cost pruning. I don\\'t need to aggressively do something different with capital deployment.\" And the stocks sort of sitting where it is, what do you think the disconnect is between sort of what you\\'re executing on the plan and kind of what the market\\'s telling you? Well, the market is telling us that for the investors, that they are still skeptical on the revenue projections moving forward. If you in fact lower the revenue, then the valuation of the company quickly comes into range. Our #1 focus is to invest where business is driven by the emerging market. Our other priority is to invest in the segments of the measurement market more that we believe we can get more growth out in the average communications or on the Life Science side, the mass spectrometers, the investment in pathology across the board or energy and Chemical Analysis. We need to continue to focus on where we think the longer-term megatrends of investment are, and that\\'s what we\\'re going to do. And I believe that when the investor community feels either more confident in the macro economy, more confident that we\\'re going to be able to execute on the investments that we\\'re making in the higher growth areas, then the results will turn around moving forward. But the fundamental issue is, as I believe, that our overall revenue growth rate projections are being discounted. And so I guess I understand that, but I guess when you look at other -- I mean there was something -- it was a Wall Street Journal article, they say something like 50% of businesses in S&P 100 are talking about cost controls and sort of CapEx controls for next year given the uncertainty. Now I get -- when you are sort of sitting there and debating whether or not the incremental/decremental margin you\\'re sort of delivering on next year given sort of the fact you\\'re kind of deciding to eat some of these incremental costs. I mean as you\\'re sort of debating that versus the growth outlook, I mean was it really just a function of you look back at \\'08, \\'09 and you said, \"All right, maybe we cut too hard in certain places,\" or \"Maybe we think we\\'ll competitively disadvantage ourselves if we do so.\" I\\'m just trying to get the sense for what was the key sort of determinant because we\\'re seeing other businesses that I guess are spending more time on the middle part of the P&L given the fact the top lines, in general, were kind of constraint? So if you go back to the question on 2009, there we had unique opportunity. One is that we did dramatically reduce the size of our corporate infrastructure. And secondly, we reset the operating model in our Electronic Measurement business under Ron\\'s leadership moving forward. However, during that period of time, we did not make dramatic cuts overall in research and development. So if you look at today in the corporate infrastructure, we will continue to negotiate with our vendors to try to get better IT support costs and supporting our real estate. And then that\\'s an ongoing business moving forward. But the other 2 big buckets of money are related to sales and R&D. And in the sales area, not making investment for the future, not making the investment to continue to expand in BRIC, I think would be highly shortsighted. On the research and development side, disrupting that organization where we know we have a very, very strong pipeline of products also I think would be a terrible mistake. And finally, in terms of manufacturing, we have been very clear that we have continued to aggressively focus on manufacturing. We\\'re closing down sites. We still have a lot of work to do to get our analytical business up to 55% gross margin. And that effort is going on as quickly as we can. So again, that\\'s not new but we are continuing the progress as we noted this quarter, I think you\\'re starting to continue to see the benefits of the effort of manufacturing. But in terms of our expense structure right now, given what we know and how quickly you could change if, in fact, that we get some stability in Europe and the United States, I believe it just would not be prudent to make back and cut back our probability of winning for the long term. If I could just put Bill\\'s comments in the last question into context with the guidance, I just want to revisit some of the assumptions you have between the pension item and then sort of all the other investments you\\'re making in the business. And the reason I asked is if I looked back at the last couple of quarters you guys have done, you\\'re a little bit averaging over $0.80 a share. And if your business conditions are more or less stable versus the last couple of quarters, my assumption is that you guys should be able to annualize north of $0.80 a quarter, which would imply $320 million plus if we back out the $0.10 of the pension expense. Just wondering the balance there between what\\'s left in your guidance? Like could you maybe help us understand what those items are on the writing expense side? I\\'ll let Didier go through the numbers, but the model is very simple. We will absorb the incremental compensation cost, and we are assuming that the manufacturing cost reduction efforts that we will implement may be offset by pricing pressure in a slow growth market. But, Didier, could you go through and go through with the delta expense and compensation expenses are? Yes, the increase in pension expense is one out of many factors. I\\'ve mentioned $100 million year-over-year increase in overall compensation benefits. Obviously, the salary increases as of December 1 is half of that, the rest being either payroll taxes, increasing health expenses, stock-based compensation because our stock has gone up over the last 4 years and things like that. You have situations also like this year we didn\\'t pay out sales commissions at target. And as we reset the budget for the fiscal year, obviously we are planning now to pay our target this fiscal year on and on and on, and then offset by -- and then as Bill said, there\\'s -- the impact of the Varian -- the last tranche of the Varian\\'s cost synergies and then other cost savings coming from the manufacturing rationalization that is taking place, that we consider especially at the low end of our guidance could possibly be offset by some level of pricing pressure. So you have all those things, and I think extrapolating the Q4 EPS is very, very aggressive. Again, to offset the compensation increases, you need the calculation of how many people have to be terminated, I think it\\'d just be a terrible decision for the company at this point in time for what we know to do that. Okay, that\\'s very understandable. Let me just one more follow-up on that, which is you\\'d maybe – Didier, offer us a little bit of color on the margin assumptions you have by the business units just so as we think about the rising cost here. Is it fair to say most of it on the margin pressure should be tied to EMG? Or is there another item here in the other segments we should keep in mind as we model through the margin impact in the various segments? Yes, in terms of operating margin, again, it is -- if you exclude Dako, which has a lower operating margin than the legacy business, at the high end of our guidance, operating margin is expected to stay relatively flat versus 2012, very, very slightly lower. And there is not -- they have some improvements more in the BAM and more conservativeness for Electronic Measurement. So the 2 have kind of offset each other. Continuous improvement on the BAM front and more pressure on the Electronic Measurement because of the reasons that have been highlighted. And -- but overall for legacy Agilent, about relatively stable operating margin year-over-year. I guess a point of clarification. Bill, I think on an earlier pricing-related question, you said that you\\'re seeing pressure on big ticket items. Just want to make sure that I heard that correctly. Big ticket deals is what I had meant to say. In other words, where our customer is putting out x number of instruments for bid, those type of deals can become quite visible to the marketplace, and the buyer has a fair amount of leverage. Okay. So that being said, is the expectation that\\'s baked into guidance that it goes past these big ticket deals and that the pricing pressure actually expands into perhaps more product-providing segments in end markets? The big concern -- it doesn\\'t work that way. Biggest concern is that in a very tough pricing environment, it leaks back across the board. And again, we\\'re not assuming that, but as Didier alluded to, if in fact you go into a year of negative growth, there\\'s just lots of pricing pressure in the organization moving forward. I think the team has done a great job of holding discounts to date. But we\\'ve seen this before. And to go in and put a forecast in this environment that suggests that, that may not happen again I think just isn\\'t very realistic. Okay. And then I guess, Bill, you discussed the expectation of a challenged growth environment for fiscal 2013 given Europe and also fiscal pressures in the U.S. Can you discuss a little bit, and you touched on this, but can you discuss a little bit your expectation more so for Europe for the full year? And also, do you have any expectations around the potential for any magnitude of potential stimulus coming from China? Right. In terms of Europe, Europe, as you know, is weak. But Europe in and of itself has been difficult for us. And we\\'re not assuming any greater deterioration. We\\'re not assuming anything particularly better in Europe moving forward. I do believe in China, there is an opportunity for more focused government stimulus once the political leadership change has been settled down and things get back to normal. Okay. And then I guess just last one for Guy. I wanted to dig a little bit into your PXI business. I think you guys have been a little more aggressive in offering solutions since you entered the market, I believe, in late 2010. And I wanted to ask you how that platform is going relative to your traditional EMG business and just thoughts around your competitive positioning in that market? Yes, thanks for the question. Definitely, we have invested as you know and have a clear long-term strategy to be in this marketplace. In fact, we have and we continue introducing new products on the PXI format. And we just introduced and showed last month the fastest-switching signal generator in this form factor. So we\\'re making good progress there. Obviously, it\\'s still small in our portfolio. I remind you the strategic position we have here is that we propose to our customers the choice because they look for a total solution where the combination of modular PXI and instruments are -- is already, in general, the right solution for what they look for. So we\\'re pleased with the progress we\\'re making there. But it\\'s a long-term plan to keep building the whole portfolio. The growth rate is much greater than our core business. But it\\'s still small. Hopefully soon, you\\'ll be able to ask him how much it is for the total business, but got the advantage of a smaller base, the growth rate is good. I was hoping that Nick could spend a minute to just talk about LSG and specifically LC and Mass Spec performance and what\\'s going on with -- what\\'s been going on with the orders in the quarter there? Thanks for the question. Well, basically, what we\\'ve seen is 2 sides of the house of the markets, which is the academic government side, everybody\\'s in pause and that\\'s causing some global ramifications that\\'s not just in the U.S., so people are tied on joint grants. Pharma side is pretty solid. So in the LC and LC/MS, obviously, they play out in that factor. We do pretty well in Pharma. We\\'re still penetrating academic. LCE is the market that looks pretty soft, and we were actually down in terms of the LC market low single digits. Mass Spec, that market is still growing, and we\\'re also growing in that market. So we think that market is a good market. We recently like the LC market, but it\\'s been a bit of a pause in terms of where the things are going. And I know last quarter, you talked about $50 million in order pushouts in the overall company, and you weren\\'t expecting them all to come through this quarter. But I\\'m just curious, did you get any visibility on some of those orders coming through or did they -- were there any cancellations overall? Hopefully, we said that we had $50 million at the end of Q3 that customers did not take delivery as expected. The delivery date, of course, being get rolled over into Q4. We did not see measurable pushouts at the end of our fiscal year, so it appears to have been an anomaly in Q3 and did not repeat itself an immeasurable amount in Q4. Okay. And just my last question, in China, in LSG, any comments you can make on the competitive environment? I know it\\'s getting a little bit more competitive, but anything you can add there? Yes, I mean it\\'s essentially more of the same. It\\'s a very competitive environment. A lot of people are going there. A lot of our competitors are putting in facilities and infrastructure which we\\'ve already had, so they\\'re getting the shiny newness of that in the marketplace. But it is really still a good economy. We saw quite a solid order step-up for the quarter, although as Bill said, the overall revenue performance was pretty soft. So we think we\\'re doing pretty good. We said we were resetting the team for the next phase of growth, and we are in fact doing that. But it takes some time. We got to get people in. We got to train them. We\\'re pleased with the progress we\\'re making, but we still have progress to make. Bill, could you talk about the -- is the scope business is most competitive in this kind of environment right now? Well, I think all the segments of the market are highly competitive. Fortunately, that\\'s one area of the market where we continue to do reasonably well. But my guess is Guy wouldn\\'t change the competitiveness versus cellphone test versus scopes. I think that\\'s far more competitive. As I said, it\\'s going to be big customers, big deal across the company. And it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s a source/spectrum analyzer, mass spectrometer, anywhere where there are going to be large buys and labs or manufacturing facilities to R&D. I think you\\'re going to see a competitive environment. As I said though, the team has done a great job of holding our discounts, and we try to add in value and differentiation and aftermarket support and service. But we are clearly being or preparing for a difficult pricing environment if, in fact, our forecast is correct that we\\'re entering into continued flat market. And then as I look on Page 6 of this handout, last quarter, I guess some of the softness was centered around the aerospace defense market. What would be the 2 areas that were softest in this current quarter, Chemical, Energy and academic, or what were the 2 that has the least visibility? Outside of aerospace and defense, which is as predicted, government spending is okay. The primes are cutting back, and that\\'s well documented. The Chemical Analysis market clearly had more difficulty. And, Mike, you want -- may make couple of comments about some of the softness you had even though there was some positive in that, the orders were better. Yes, Bill, sure. As we\\'ve commented in the third quarter, we\\'ve talked a lot about the slowness in the Chemical space in our Q3 results. We saw that carry forward into the fourth quarter as well, mainly in the replacement market for chromatography products. And if you got the chance, you may have actually seen some of our major customers also make announcements in the Chemical space after the third quarter where they are either restructuring or having some plant closures. But as Bill mentioned, we do see -- feel like we\\'ve reached the bottom there. And -- but we saw that the weakness of the callout in the third quarter to continue into the fourth quarter. Okay. And then last, the China growth, negative 3% in this handout again. And were there any placement orders like the last couple of quarters where the Asia x Japan was not really negative 3%, but kind of color around anything on what core growth really was? No. I mean the -- you\\'re referring probably to a large orders in the wireless manufacturing test that we had in the second and third quarter. In the fourth quarter, as expected, the volume of orders or revenue came down, so it was not a big factor. Most of my questions have been answered. I just -- I guess a little more on the investments that you\\'re talking about, increased salaries, compensation and benefits, how much of that is for let\\'s call it existing infrastructure of people and assets? And then how much more is just actual incremental, say, feet on the street, new facilities, new marketing efforts, new product development? Can you kind of flush out these incremental costs year-over-year versus new versus legacy? The vast majority of the numbers that Didier quoted are related to the 22,000 existing employees. We will continue the investment in Dako, in the expansion in Asia, the increase in research and development. But first order, the -- all of the additional fixed costs that we\\'re seeing are related to our existing headcount. And we have no plans in this environment for measurable increase in headcount as we move forward. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just want to make -- just want to clarify something. So it sounds like the softness in the Communications business, this was more of you had really strong quarters in Q2, Q3, and this is just sort of a slowing from that rate and just a sort of delay and sort of the infrastructure build? Okay. And what about the competitive landscape there? Have you seen any new players coming in, people being more aggressive? Since Teradyne\\'s buying LitePoint, have they become more aggressive in the market? Well the overall competitiveness, as Bill was mentioning, is to across all market segments, and wireless is definitely one of those. So there are a number of competitors. You mentioned one that are pushing very hard, especially in the production environment. Right. That\\'s sort of what I was getting at. And I guess just to sort of clarify the speed, there was no further slowing as sort of the quarter went on in some of the academic end markets, basically inside, there are things you didn\\'t take another step-down that you saw -- you didn\\'t see any further hesitation on that part? No. I think they\\'re pretty much were on the brakes towards the end of our last quarter. And this is exactly what we expected in Q4. Remember that I have not been highly positive on what would happen, and it\\'s been my expectation with where we thought they would be. As you all know, I\\'m not the most optimistic guy in this environment right now. And that was the good news is academic and research and overall for the company, there really wasn\\'t much change in the end markets from Q4 to Q3. Great. And just one final question, can you sort of like give us some of your timeline projections on Dako? And when can we see -- what are we expecting to see new products coming out? And was -- could you just sort of update us on what sort of the product flow will be? Lars, why don\\'t you take that and give an update on where the integration is going and where we\\'re headed? Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. Well I think the bottom line is, as Bill and Didier alluded to, is actually some [indiscernible]. And Dako continues to deliver the base business, which is on or slightly ahead of schedule actually. We still had some work cut out for us in terms of the ramp-up of feet on the street in APAC and so forth and also some of the buyout of indirect channels. These are things that are in place and actually going to kick in towards the back half of fiscal year \\'13. Now in terms of the very much long expected, long awaited next generation from Dako, we continue to make progress and on track for a 2013 market launch. So let me just characterize where we stand right now. As we speak, we are in a, call it a limited manufacturing ramp. And during the next I will say 3 to 4 months, we ease our way into the kind of the early test signs, and this is now then going to be expanded into kind of more what we call a beetle [ph] side, which is kind of more of a commercial expense. And somewhere there between I would say third and fourth quarter, I do expect that all breaks are going to be altered, are going to be -- form an impact to the product availability. And this is a global one. So this is, I think, the most significant product launch that we are expecting. On top of that, we have a number of new antibodies coming out, obviously the SureFISH expansion with the probes is hitting us on a weekly basis, and this is rapidly expanding the portfolio of products that we are having. But just to characterize Dako and the -- to 2013, we are on track with the launch of [indiscernible]. Great. And just one quick one. Nick, what are you doing to sort of revamp the cytogenetics pipeline and the product portfolio there? There\\'s a lot of new -- obviously with Illumina buying BlueGnome and assay getting so bad there, how are you kind of going after and revamping the side of product? Well I\\'ve got lots of opinions, but I have the great opportunity to share those with Lars. And Lars has been managing that. So I\\'m going to kick this to him, and if he wants the other comments, I\\'ll let him kick it back to me. Well, thank you, Nick. It\\'s my pleasure to take that on. Well, I\\'m sure as you guys noted that we made a joint announcement together with NimbleGen on the array side just a couple of weeks ago. So we are now in a coordinated effort moving forward to convert the customer base, and that is a fairly significant amount of customer and business. And we will continue to make a fairly rapid progress in that regard. And we are obviously rapidly expanding our SureFISH line of products. We currently have 450 FISH probes, and we have 15 new probes actually targeting leukemia. So what you\\'ll see is going to be a very concentrated effort around our FISH business, our array business, but also around the basic target, in which I\\'m pleased with Halo flakes. That continues to make a terrific progress as we are actually exceeding our expectations in that regard. So it\\'s going to be a very focused effort from our side in those areas. Bill, 2 questions. One, you commented that you believe there would be a budget resolution. And I\\'m sorry to ask this, but what gives you that level of confidence and why doesn\\'t the overall business environment with respect to spending or business spending get materially worse? And then likewise, and perhaps inversely, if there is a resolution, why doesn\\'t business spending actually get materially better? And you\\'ve kind of hit the midpoint, I guess, to some degree, but I would actually argue that there is potentially a greater window for sales to have either the higher upside and then likewise sales to have even greater downside? Appreciate some comments. Well, you just said the 2 bookends of our discussion for the last 2 weeks on how to give guidance in facing of the financial or the fiscal cliff moving forward. Our forecast assumes that there\\'s a resolution. That\\'s not my own personal opinion, but that\\'s just the overall assumption. I -- as you know, the odds are somewhere between 30% to 50% that there won\\'t be a resolution. But assuming that there is moving forward, I think that because of the delay of resolution, you are already starting to slow down. You\\'re heading into the holiday season so for -- the way our fiscal year is constructed, one could easily see a Q1 that is soft and potentially a Q2. I won\\'t argue with you. If there is a successful budget resolution, then the second half of the year things could get better. And of course if that happens, then we\\'ll adjust our forecast accordingly moving forward. But at this point in time, we have been completely candid on what our thinking is and try to give the best outlook we can with the available amount of data we have. And we all know that there is a wide potential outcome. Just 2 questions, I guess maybe for Guy or Didier. When you look at the EMG business and you look at the order number in the fourth quarter, typically we built some backlog, typically we have a book-to-bill that\\'s well north of 1 in EMG. And what I guess I\\'m a bit concerned about is does the first half of the year look like down 15% to 20% with the back half for the year up 20% to 25%, is that the way the revenue distribution would look? For fiscal year \\'13? No, no. It\\'s way flatter than that. But basically Q1 would be fairly similar than to Q4 in terms of revenue decremental. In Q4, we had 4% core revenue decline year-over-year. But you took about $60 million out of backlog, right? I mean I\\'m just -- I mean generally speaking, your first quarter is 90% of your fourth quarter orders, which would put you sub $700 million in sales. But that\\'s not the case. He can talk to you. And we have looked at the same numbers as you have for Q4, and have done the exercise and that led us to the kind of guidance that I\\'m mentioning. Again in Q4, our core revenue growth was -- decline was about -- was 4% and in Q1, we expect something more like 5% to 6% revenue decline. That\\'s embedded in our guidance. Just as a clarification again, the guidance that we\\'re giving that made up over for EMG is still for a revenue number that is below the incoming order rate in Q4. So again, I don\\'t -- we look at all of those, and we don\\'t think it\\'s out of bounds. Obviously, that\\'s the number that tends to have the more volatility. But I think mathematically and what we know the pipeline is, we feel okay. Okay. And then just one other thing, I mean aerospace defense you usually have a bit more visibility there. Obviously, one area that could be pretty impacted here depending on what happens within negotiations, budget negotiations. What do the orders in aerospace defense look like in the fourth quarter? This is Guy. We had better orders in gross compared to last year in aerospace defense for this quarter. The year-end business has been there as we were expecting it and in fact, we\\'re still expecting this coming into the last 2 months of this year. So I would say it was still -- it was positive. Again, Guy, correct me if I\\'m wrong, because a lot of the spending comes from the government, use it or lose it... Most frankly will happen. The primes is where we\\'re seeing a cutback in anticipation of the actual direct government spending most likely will play out as predicted for the end of the year? At this time, I\\'m showing no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Thank you, Derek. On behalf of the management team, we\\'d like to thank everybody for joining our call today, and also wish you a happy holiday in advance of the season. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\\'s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I\\'ll be your conference coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\\'s event is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Alicia. Thank you, Regina, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2013. With me are Agilent\\'s CEO, Bill Sullivan; as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s President and Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian. Also joining are the Presidents of our Electronic Measurement Group, Chemical Analysis and Diagnostics and Genomics groups, Guy Séné, Mike McMullen and Lars Holmkvist. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for financial results, where you will find revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Bill and Didier\\'s comments today will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Before turning the call over to Bill, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its annual Analyst Meeting in New York City on March 7. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent Investor website 2 weeks prior to that date. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. For Agilent\\'s fiscal first quarter, orders were $1.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, inclusive of the benefits in the Dako acquisition. Revenue of $1.68 billion were up 3%, again with the benefit of the Dako acquisition, but in the low-end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $0.63 were $0.02 below the low-end of our guidance due entirely to some unexpected onetime expenses. The company has struggled with the predictability of revenue and EPS performance over the past 4 quarters. While we have delivered EPS above the midpoint guidance in aggregate, we have missed our EPS guidance in 2 of the last 4 sequential quarters and have exceeded EPS guidance in the other 2 quarters. The problem is the volatility of revenue and orders in the last month of the quarter. Last year\\'s third quarter EPS shortfall was due to the unexpected push out of deliveries. This quarter, we again experienced an unexpected last-minute push out of deliveries, mostly in the communication market. In addition, while we were pleased with our strong January orders, over half of January\\'s orders were received in the last 5 days of the month. Our order fulfillment team did an outstanding job of meeting the low-end of our revenue guidance, but we missed our internal revenue forecast by $35 million, which decreased our earnings per share by $0.05. With the lower revenue, we were not able to absorb the unexpected expenses. We ask for patience from our shareholders as our customers continue to face challenging delivery need. Agilent maintains a flexible delivery policy, and we are committed to be the best measurement partner for our customers as they meet their own business challenges. Moving forward, we are widening our quarterly guidance range to set better expectations for our investors. We now anticipate likely cutbacks in defense spending, which accounts for about 10% of Agilent\\'s business, and continued softness in the Communications market. As a result, we\\'re lowering our revenue guidance for the year, as well as our EPS range. We continue to control expenses well. We are driving down our variable spending as to reduce our flex force and we are aggressively implementing our manufacturing consolidation plan. As we continue to manage through end market and customer uncertainties, we are encouraged by the strong January orders, the breadth of new product launches and the benefits of the expense reductions we expect to see for the remaining part of the year. Within the businesses, our newly formed Diagnostics and Genomics groups revenue grew 145%, up 4% organically. The integration of Dako continues to proceed well. We saw a mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in pathology standing market and high-growth in expanding our Pharma partnership as evidenced by the recently announced partnerships with Eli Lilly and Pfizer. We are also pleased with our strong, high-single digit sequential growth in revenue as we continue to expand our sales team in Asia and launch new products. For example, our HER2 IQ FISH was approved by the FDA. Datalink was upgraded as the market\\'s leading software tool, linking all of Dako\\'s instruments together for optimal lab control and workflow optimization and the launch of our new automated stainer remains on track for commercial release. Our overall Genomics business grew in low-single digits with a continued strength in CGH arrays for clinical market. SureFISH sales continue to see high renewal rate. Our Life Science business grew 2% year-over-year. Academic and government markets were flat, with modest growth in Pharma markets and mid-single-digit sequential growth. We continue to see solid growth in our Consumables and Service business and modest growth in our LC instrument platform. While we saw a decrease in our LC/MS business due to difficult year-over-year compares, orders grew in the low double-digits. We also introduced several new products in the quarter to improve LC detection and increase workflow productivity. Chemical Analysis revenues were down slightly year-over-year, due entirely to the decline in our environmental market. This is the second quarter in a row of weak environmental sales. The fundamental cause is lower government spending. We continue to see strong growth in the forensics market and flat to modest growth in food and petrochemical. At the beginning of February, we announced the introduction of our new 7890B gas chromatograph, and the 5977A series single quad Mass Spec. These next generation products offer industry-leading productivity, sensitivity and reliability. Electronic Measurement revenues were down 7% over last year. This was mostly due to a decrease in the wireless handset market after a period of strong investment, but compounded by push outs of delivery. Base Station investment remained soft, as we await the rollout of LTE in other major regions around the world. Orders did strengthen in January as we ended the quarter with a book-to-bill greater than one. And even as we manage through the current market volatility, we continue to ensure that we have market-leading product. We introduced the InfiniiVision 4000 X-series oscilloscope, the only upgradable family of 5-in-1 oscilloscopes in the industry. And on February 8, we introduced the industry\\'s highest performing real time Spectrum Analyzer for our PXA signal analyzers. As a reminder, in January we announced the 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share, as well as stock repurchase program up to $500 million during fiscal year 2013. These moves reflect our confidence in our ability to manage the present business volatility, our ability to generate cash and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As Bill stated, it has become more challenging to predict the short-term outcomes. 70% of our revenue is related to capital expenditures, where customers\\' buying decisions are heavily dependent on overall demand and business confidence, both at low levels in today\\'s world of uncertainty. Because of customers\\' delays in placing orders, shipments were also delayed. As a result, we achieved only the low end of our revenue guidance. However, we missed the low-end of our EPS guidance by $0.02 due to unexpected and onetime items. Three items made up most of the $0.02. They relate to customs duties in a foreign jurisdiction, unclaimed property claims in the U.S. and a balance sheet hedging loss. For a company of our size and complexity, such items, both positive and negative, are not unusual. However, this is the first time that they all were unfavorable. To recap the quarter, core orders were flat year-over-year, while core revenue decreased 2% and our operating margin, always the lowest of the year in Q1, was slightly over 17%. By segment, EMG core revenue decreased 7% year-over-year. CAG was up 1%, LSG 3% and DGG 6%. By region, Americas was down 1%, Europe, 2%; Japan, 6%; and the rest of Asia Pacific, 2%, all on a core revenue basis. Now turning to cash. We generated $245 million in operating cash flow. By far, the largest Q1 cash flow generation since Q1 of 2000. We bought back 2 million shares for $79 million and are back to a net cash position of over $150 million. Now turning to the guidance for the full year. As Bill stated, the low-end of our guidance now assumes sequestration will take place, while the high-end reflects a slower economic recovery, lower government spending and softer communication markets than previously assumed. Also, currency is expected to have a negative revenue impact of about $35 million for the year, versus the November guidance. Fiscal year \\'13 revenue is expected to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, or 2% reported growth at midpoint, which translates into 1% core revenue decrease. As you compare those projections with those of our peers, please note the different product and customer mix. We generally have a higher mix of instruments versus recurring revenues, and are more exposed to the industrial and defense market, as well as to Japan. On an apple-to-apple basis, we are gaining ground in many of our businesses, but current results and short-term projections are skewed by our mix. On the cost front, our global order fulfillment organization is on track to generate about $50 million of savings, and our control of discretionary expenses is nearly of the same magnitude as during the 2009 downturn. Those actions, coupled with the benefit of the incremental stock buyback program, will partially offset the impact of lower revenue projections and currency headwinds on our EPS, which is expected to range from $2.70 to $3. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. As Bill stated, we are widening our guidance range for the quarter for both revenue and EPS. We expect Q2 revenue of $1.74 billion to $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.64 to $0.70. So obviously, a lot of questions to go through here. So I\\'ll let others hop in. But I guess, very big picture on some of your last comments, Didier, around cost control. Can you maybe just, given the fact that things seem to be a little bit slower, and I guess you\\'re not anticipating them getting much better, even though some macro indicators actually suggest like things could get better in the second half, can you maybe just walk us through exactly what you\\'re doing on the cost side? And maybe why you\\'re not being a little bit more aggressive? Let me make that comment, John, if you don\\'t mind, for Didier, the details. Fundamentally, I\\'m actually more optimistic than I was last quarter. As you know, I\\'ve tended to be somewhat pessimistic. If you look at where some of our growth opportunities are, the introduction of our new products, there\\'s actually signs that things are going to get better. So I believe that not continuing to expand in emerging markets, not continuing our R&D investments, not continuing our reach, is just a bad strategy moving forward right now. As a result of that, Ron and Didier have put together a detailed plan of ensuring not only are we going to drive $40 million of manufacturing cost out, and this is the first time we\\'ve announced the quantity of that, that we are in the process of eliminating our temporary workforce, managing all non-customer, non-new product introductions. And if you go back to the 2009 downturn, which is quite severe where we, in fact, weren\\'t making 17% operating profit, we were able to take substantial amount of money out of the system. So we are aggressively implementing that moving forward. Our guidance policy has been the same at this point in time. The forecast for the rest of the year is $7.1 billion of revenue and $3 a share, that\\'s our outlook. But we are widening the downside because of the continued volatility that we are seeing at -- over, that we\\'ve seen over the last 4 quarters. Okay. So just maybe on those cost savings that you just announced, maybe just give us a little better sense of kind of how long it will take for the -- and when we\\'ll start to see those in the numbers? I mean those are immediate the eliminating the temporary workforce, I guess, but maybe some of the manufacturing cost out and some of the other savings initiatives. When should those start to -- when should we start to see the full impact of those? We will see the full impact of this as we go through quarter for quarter. And Jon, quite frankly, and for the other analysts, we have had to stop the volatility of our announcement. We are going to take a broader range to set fair expectations moving forward, and we are going to do everything possible as a management team to ensure that we become more predictable in this slow growth environment moving forward. And so we have built into the $3 upper end range, the manufacturing cost reduction, and if we\\'re successful getting more variable cost, that will become a hedge against any volatility in the topline. Okay, and then if I can, just one more, on just the guidance itself. I mean it looks like your revenue outlook is slightly -- we\\'re saying the midpoint, before it was flat, now you\\'re kind of minus 1%. And if I just -- if I do the quick math, you get to the $0.10 that you\\'re talking about. I mean, it just seems like you\\'re letting that flow-through 100% of that. Am I missing anything else? Are there any other things going on for that $0.10 that you\\'re lowering the guidance for, for the year? Just $100 million of lower revenue, that would translate into $0.14, just to be precise. So there\\'s some offset to that, and that\\'s why we\\'re only -- and I mentioned those offsets in my scripts and that\\'s why we are reducing the EPS by $0.10 and not by $0.14. Didier, did you mention how much buyback you\\'ve put into your numbers at this point, for the rest of \\'13 and then I\\'d love to hear Bill\\'s perspective if anything has changed on the political front, on the tax repatriation issue. I mean, do you see any resolution to that dynamic in 2013? Anything you\\'re willing to offer there would be great. Yes, I\\'ll answer the first question. So the forecast assumes we utilize all of the $500 million before the end of the fiscal year. And that we finish the year with 347 million -- on the last quarter, 347 million shares versus the 352 million we had in the Q1. And in terms of, regards the likelihood of a change of tax policy this year, I remain skeptical that anything will be accomplished. Okay. If you look at the remainder of the year, Bill, can you just talk about, it seems like with a surge in orders in the last month. It just seems like you sound more positive, yet the numbers are coming down. Help us reconcile what incremental caution you\\'ve baked in from here, I guess it\\'s not clear to me. If orders are improving, why you\\'re not a little bit more bullish about the top line? Well, as I said, I think that, first of all, there is a likelihood of defense cutbacks. Again, we\\'ll know on March 1, as we have said. And there is evidence out there that the cell phone market after a huge investment may, in fact, be slowing down. And again, there\\'ve been some other independent articles written on that. So you couple those 2, the outlook and again, when we give guidance, it\\'s very clear, the top line is what our forecast is, and then we decrement for there for the volatility, and unfortunately, we\\'ve been too narrow in this environment. And so if you combine the likely outhood in U.S. Defense spending, coupled with any sort of slowing in the communication markets, that is why we took the top line number of last quarter\\'s $7.2 billion and lowered it to $7.1 billion. Yes, the third factor I have mentioned is that, in the last 3 months, the yen has weakened 20% versus the dollar. And overall the currency impact is a reduction in revenue for the whole year at the present actions rate, about $35 million. So that\\'s also a component of the $100 million. It\\'s just pure currency. Understood. Last thing, are you likely to know what form the defense cuts will take on March 1? And what I mean by that is, are you just assuming a ubiquitous cut in your defense business? Or do you actually have clarity on specific programs that you\\'re in, that may receive funding reductions or the mix, basically the mix of the cuts? There\\'s preliminary work was done by Guy\\'s team, and again I don\\'t know if Guy has any additional color, but right now, if you assume they muddle through with a moderate cut, the impact, we believe, would be 10% on our U.S. Defense. Worst-case scenario would be 20%. So they -- so they\\'ve modeled that to the best that they -- they can. Yes, this is Guy. I just second what Bill said, that clearly this is what we have modeled in, a 10% decrease. Bill, so I understand that widening your guidance range will allow you to end up in ranges going forward, but I\\'m curious what programs you\\'re implementing internally to improve your order book visibility and decrease the final week of the month loading that happens with the company? Besides praying, let me just share with you, the situation. So we deal with thousands of customers every quarter. The top 25 customers purchased in Q1 $275 million, that\\'s an average of $11 million a customer. 80% of the delivery changes came from these 25 customers. And again, Agilent historically has had very liberal delivery policies moving forward, we work with our customers, they have their own set of issues, and so you can see -- and again, we had this quarter nailed on January 16 when I spoke to the Board of Directors. And all of a sudden, someone says, \"Hey, look, I can\\'t take the delivery for X, Y or Z reason,\" and you\\'re sort of stuck. And you can\\'t invoice and so you can\\'t recognize revenue. Even the late orders, our manufacturing team did a great job turning the orders, got them in the pipeline, but we just couldn\\'t recognize revenue based on, as you know, very, very tight revenue recognition rules. So I wish I could say something magical, I think it would be a bad mistake not to work with our customers, I mean they have their own set of issues. But in this environment, which is a slower growth environment, any change out of one of these big customers can become a surprise. And it\\'s happened 2 out of the last 4, and the flip side of it is, to the other 2 quarters, we\\'ve been over guidance as you know, quite substantially. So I think as long as that we\\'re in a slower growth environment, around flat, we\\'re going to have more volatility. The answer, of course is, is to get back into our operating model of 4% -- low-end of our operating model of 4% organic growth rate, and I think that the signal noise ratio will just become lower. But I -- right now, unfortunately, there is not a magic answer right now, just given how concentrated the surprise has been in 2 of the last 4 quarters. The good news is, these orders aren\\'t getting canceled. I mean, this is not a 2001, 2009 where all heck broke out and people are canceling orders. This is just strictly the issue of your assumptions to the end of the quarter. Didier said we are a highly capitalized capital equipment company. A lot of the revenue goes out the last month of the quarter, and over the years, it\\'s been predictable. The last 4 quarters, is not, we have not done a good job predicting. And Bill, a follow-up on CAG and softness in Environmental. We haven\\'t heard that, kind of heard the opposite at some of the other companies. So can you tell me where, globally, some of the softness is coming from? And any other specifics you can give on the Environmental side? Yes, I\\'ll do that. A couple of comments. I have been at some companies that they have mentioned this, and again we sort of have a unique position in environmental test labs, so Mike, why don\\'t you go ahead and respond to that. Yes, sure Bill. First of all, just reminder, I would say that Agilent probably has the strongest position in the Environmental Testing market, with the breadth of our portfolio. So movements there are really amplified in terms of our total result. But to the specific question, where we\\'ve seen it is -- been in the U.S. marketplace, both at the federal, and state and local level, as well as Europe. Japan also is weak, so the story is, U.S., Europe and Japan. The emerging markets, Brazil, India and China continue to vest in these areas, but it\\'s not enough to offset the challenge we\\'ve seen in some of the more mature geographies. I would say there is a bright note, if you will, that\\'s emerging on the U.S. side, which is the push in the area of frac-ing, which actually is starting to increase the sample sizes [ph] coming into the private contract lab, the Environmental side. So but the, again, not enough to overwhelm the downside on the government\\'s spending side. And again, I would just point out that we\\'re particularly leveraged here, given our strength in this marketplace. Hi, this is Vijay in for Ross. My first one was in the communications market, Berlin [ph]. I know that you sort of alluded to the fact that the communications, I mean, we might be peaking in the smartphone market. That\\'s been a large part of the growth story here. Could you lay out sort of what the base case is for action, what\\'s the house view? What are you guys thinking on the cell phone markets? And how we\\'d sort of look at that market on a 2 to 3-year time frame? Go ahead, Guy, why don\\'t you give, latest perspective and again, you have to remember, we have an infrastructure, we have a leading position. We have the components and chipset and then we\\'ve got the handhelds. So Guy, why don\\'t you give a overview of what the latest thinking is. Yes, your question was on the long-term. And clearly on the long-term, we still believe that the overall smartphone growth is solid. And most especially all the data that these smartphones are using among also all the other devices, the mobile devices like tablet. So that\\'s clearly the major growth engine for the industry. And then, obviously, for our Test & Measurement solution, as we address not only the R&D and manufacturing for the devices, but as Bill was just mentioning, we have a very strong position in the infrastructure. And here, I must say that we start having more, or at least better news as you probably heard, the U.S. operators are planning to add more CapEx in infrastructure. There\\'s been movement in China around the 4G allocation, that is for China mobile. No firm date yet, and that\\'s a little bit, the uncertainty that we have short term. But the overall infrastructure market is something that we should start seeing coming up later in the year. So that\\'s clearly what I would add for now. Got it. And maybe my next question, for Didier, and I know that, Didier, you mentioned on the last call, a lot of folks asked on restructuring. And sort of the way you laid out the case was depending on the environment, and the environment at that time did not warrant for a restructuring. And I guess one quarter in, you\\'re looking at sort of fluctuation order flows, and volatility in some of the markets. We\\'re also looking at maybe a potential sequestration, maybe a little bit of softening on the Com side. What would sort of prompt you to take a more -- want to take more, I guess, significant restructuring activities and get the earnings up? Okay, now let me start answering, then probably Bill would want to also say a word. The first thing is that it is not that we\\'re not doing any restructuring. We are doing restructuring. It is very circumscribed. It is very well defined as we are reorganizing our manufacturing footprint and really going after the cost synergies that we\\'re already committed to on the Varian side and the further cost synergies on the other front. So there is a lot of restructuring that is going on, but it is not broad-based and it is not indiscriminate. It is very, very well defined. And then for the rest, I think Bill already addressed the question. We do still -- we don\\'t see any change to the secular growth rate of the company, and we do see opportunities in the midterm. Which means that we are not ready to do something that is more indiscriminate and similar to what we have seen in 2009. Bill, do you want to add to it? I just agree. I think that, given where we are now, putting the company in some sort of oscillation with taking out some of our core, given the opportunities we have, the products that we have in pipeline, to be able to move the EPS by a few cents. We know what to do. We have a great track record to make that happen. And right now, we are going to continue to invest and continue to be a leader in the Measurement market. I was just wondering if Mike or Nick can maybe break out the instrument declines or growth in the LSG and CHG (sic) [CGH] segments for, versus Consumables? Yes, Mike, do you want to do that? And again, I apologize, Nick is overseas right now. He\\'s not on this call, but Mike, could you give a flavor at least on the GCs and LCs and Mass Spec and... Yes, sure. I think the overall answer would be is, we\\'ve seen continued, really solid growth, both in our Consumables business and Services business. The growth, as Didier mentioned, are relative to the instruments, and are tied to the capital expenditures of our customers, is actually more depressed. But with some bright spots in certain places where we\\'ve got our Spectroscopy business growing, and I think Bill earlier in this call pointed to the growth in LC/MS and LC. I would say on our gas-based business, which is the franchise business for the Chemical Analysis group, we continue to be challenged there a bit, given the weakness in the Industrial segment and the Environmental marketing we talked about earlier but actually down slightly and the situation is stabilized. And I must say we\\'re actually fairly optimistic, moving forward, because as of the 1st of February, we launched 2 major new products, which replace our franchise -- I mean our flagship products in that core business. So the long and short of it is the aftermarket, our Service and Consumables business continues to do quite well, growing faster right now that our Instrument business and then the, as I said earlier, some parts of the portfolio are growing faster than others on the instrument side. Okay, appreciate that. And I realize that the competitive dynamic is pretty stiff in several of your markets, so I guess any thoughts on whether or not you think there\\'s a share change dynamic that may be impacting growth anywhere in the business? As Didier alluded to, we don\\'t believe there\\'s any substantive change in terms of share. Clearly, some of our markets where we\\'re really strong, become weaker and by defect there\\'s a shift. But in terms of anything fundamental, competitor to competitor in a specific market, we don\\'t believe there\\'s anything fundamentally that\\'s changed. Okay. And if I could just maybe sneak in a last one. Your perspective on Europe at this point, just given the outlook that you gave and the last time around, that you -- the expectations were not much in the way of improvement, but also not deterioration. Could you just sort of give us a way that you are looking at Europe? Yes, I think Europe and the U.S., it\\'s muddled forward. The last quarter we had before, we faced lots of issues in the U.S. As I said last quarter, the Europeans\\' appeared to stabilized, the situation in the U.S. has actually a bit stabilized. And so overall, it\\'s more positive. But I think that the opportunities in U.S., Europe and Japan are -- it\\'s going to be a tough environment. That\\'s why we need to continue to invest in new products and continue to invest in emerging markets. At least a question on -- so from some sequestration, can you just quantify that $65 million operating revenue decline that you built in there. How much of that dollar amount is due to the impact of the sequestration? On the top line, the -- we, there\\'s $200 million delta between the high-end and the low end of the range. And clearly, the low-end incorporates sequestration scenario. On the high-end, it is not a full figure sequester. It is really, really tight budget spending. But not a complete sequester of the sort that we have baked into the low-end of the range. So it\\'s not -- sequestration is not the scenario for the high-end, or at least a permanent sequester is not a scenario for the high end of the range. And again it\\'s that model is that 10% of our business is with the Department of Defense and -- or excuse me, in the defense market, of which 65% is U.S. only. So that\\'s the range of the exposure that we have. Okay. And then maybe, within the Communications segment, can you just fill in a little deeper, like specifically you call out handset weakness, you call out Base-Station weakness. Was it -- could you give us a little color, was it a particular, one large vendor that you basically -- I know the second quarter you have a tougher comp from that production order that you captured last year. But could you give a little more color, just on what\\'s going on within the headset market? Is it a pause ahead of maybe, some of the impact the buildout of some of these systems that we\\'re going to see an uptick, or -- because, I guess, when we looked at -- when you listen to some of the competitors, while things aren\\'t good, at least I\\'ve seem to be signaling things are pointing in the right direction right now. So I\\'m just trying to figure out what\\'s going on there. Right now, in Q1, we said we expected the business to roll off because of the investment leading into the new year. So -- and I think that has been universal across the market. So we knew that the Q1s, particularly our Q1 is going to be lighter moving forward. Then the guess is, what\\'s going to happen. Really easy to say, everything is going to be great. There are lots of external articles as Guy alluded to, that are suggesting that the growth of smartphones, even though it\\'s the hottest part of the market, may in fact be slowing. The total cell phone market growth for the year is only targeted at 1%. And so, again, we are a conservative company, laying out exactly what we see. If the other guys are right, we\\'ll do better. But right now we don\\'t hope for things, we just try to look at the best data that we have available to us at what\\'s going to happen. And again, we\\'ve been doing cell phone tests for over 10 years. And before that under HP I used to run the RF microwave group, inside of Hewlett-Packard, finding components. This stuff is highly volatile, in -- as people build up for capacity and then, of course, utilize that capacity as the markets slow down. And of course, there\\'s huge changes from vendor to vendor and who wins, which also has a second order effect on investment. And then maybe one final, just related to that, Bill. But so does that portend any real scenes in the way you\\'re operating your Comm business, I mean it sounds kind of negative. If the smartphone market\\'s really kind of slowing, is there a point going forward that -- an earlier question alluded to. I think Guy mentioned China, we have 4G licenses somewhat coming in this country [ph] but how long could this pause, in this smartphone market occur and kind of what are you doing internally to deal with it? Well, I would say it\\'s a -- I wouldn\\'t see it as a pause, first. There is ongoing investment happening. And as you know, most of the overall manufacturing investment that are aligned the new product introductions is usually happening more into Q2, Q3. So I would not say there\\'s a pause. But in the same time, the fact that some of the smartphones are really aligned with 2 major companies, it has an efficiency play in the manufacturing that we have to take into account when we forecast our business with them. The wildcard is to see if there are other companies, the Chinese companies and some smaller player, and understand when they will come up with some of the devices around LTE, for instance. And that\\'s still in the cards, and we\\'ve not seen it yet, but obviously, it will happen at one moment. Didier, just want to get back to an earlier point on, just sort of the forecasting in the visibility in the quarter, and what you\\'re going to do to work on that. Would you be able to share some of the specific actions that you\\'re taking to improve your forecasting methods, because it does seem to me that widening the guidance range is helpful, but not necessarily something that specifically addresses the key issues there when it comes to forecasting going forward. Yes, and Bill addressed that in saying that a lot of the issues just come from customers that we -- and we\\'re absolutely determined to give them the flexibility that they need in order to operate in a very volatile environment for them, too. So it is not so much -- look at it as customer satisfaction kind of issue also. That we are not going to fight the customers if they want to have a little bit more flexibility within the last minute to serve their need. I don\\'t know, Bill? I can\\'t say it any clearer than that. $20 million of revenues, $0.03 a share. And we are not going to change our policy towards our customers in working with them on delivery. A lot of these deliveries, they can have installations and all the rest. We\\'re in a slower growth environment. We know the pluses and minuses of how people run their business. We\\'re shipping capital equipment, and it is just very easy to have, for example, a $20 million change at the last minute and that\\'s $0.03. And there\\'s just no way you can recover it at the end of the quarter. And so that\\'s where we are. Yes, will we do a better job of second-guessing our customers? Sure. What the net result is, that you end up lowering your guidance, right? And because you\\'re surely not going to bet on anybody accelerating receipt in this environment, unless the economy turns around. And just in a big catch-22, and we\\'re just being as transparent as we can and again, hopefully, given the actions that we\\'re taking to minimize on the downside and again, continue to focus on increasing our organic growth rate that the volatility that we\\'ve seen in the last 4 quarters will dissipate in time. Okay, and then just to be -- that\\'s helpful. And then just maybe to follow-up on the comment on the $20 million and $0.03. Just to be clear -- that entirely is tied to timing of orders, not -- and to be specific, not tied to anything related to market share. And I think there was a question asked earlier about sort of how you guys map up versus your competitors. Just trying to be clear that, there wasn\\'t anything in the quarter, in your opinion, that had to do with market share or large contracts switching hands? Again, all that happened was, and again, as I said on January 16, we were highly confident that we were going to have another $0.05 of EPS, highly confident. End of the quarter, phone calls up, \"Hey, sorry, can you delay this thing a week, and the delivery a week?\" And, that\\'s it. You\\'re done. Secondly, with the late orders, the team did a great job of actually turning the orders, get them out the door, but you can\\'t recognize the revenue because you haven\\'t gotten the invoice. And it is as simple as that, I mean we are incredibly disappointed. And the team did a great job in the last week trying to scramble around, but I mean, unfortunately things happen. In the course of history, in the last 4 quarters, that $35 million rolled into Q2, right? $0.05 rolls into Q2. So again, if you look at the last 4 quarters, aggregate, we have been above the midpoint and have executed fine. Unfortunately, right now we are seeing the highest volatility, quite frankly, that I\\'ve seen since we created Agilent, outside of the 2001, 2009 downturn. This is Bryan Kip [ph] on behalf of Paul. You guys alluded to some cost synergies that are still going on at Varian. Can you, just jump into that a little bit further? Are you still seeing margin improvement or benefits from the Varian acquisition? Absolutely. Bill mentioned that -- or I did, also in my script. There\\'s -- we\\'re going to deliver $50 million of incremental cost synergies and Varian is a chunk of that. I would say about half of that is the from the Varian, and we have another year to go before we accomplish our goal in terms of delivering $100 million of cost synergies for Varian. And the rest are other cost synergies that will be delivered by the new Agilent or the fulfillment organization, and which will cover both logistics, manufacturing rationalization and material savings. And just one more follow-up. You guys mentioned some headwinds on the currency side in Asia, specifically in Japan. But how is that region helping or hurting total margins? Well in -- well certainly, in general, I mean, our margins -- our prices are about the same in whatever regions where we operate. So you could say that the margins on the regions where operating expenses might be -- are lower, is better, obviously, operating margin level. If that answer your question, I\\'m not sure exactly. If that addresses your question or not, with the...? Yes, I guess just -- are your margins in your Asia Pacific region, are they above the company average, the 17, slightly north of 17 this quarter. Are you guys seeing some headwinds there, or...? Gross margins are about the same, and usually, as you can imagine, the CL selling [ph] costs are lower in some of those regions, than they are in the high-cost [indiscernible] and Ron would like to add. The biggest issue that affects our margins is our mix. So when we look at some of the products that are sent to China for manufacturing, that has a different margin structure than some other project -- other products. But for the exact same products, our margins hold up very well. Did you ever, Bill, say what was embedded in guidance for the growth in the core business? I know, previously you\\'d said minus 1.5% to 1.5%. Can you just be clear on what\\'s embedded for core growth? So by business, if I look at the high-end of the guidance where the core growth is about flat for Agilent, it will be in your 4% to 5% reduction in the EMG; 3% to 4% increase in CAG; 4% to 5% increase in LSG; and DGG -- and again, we\\'re talking organic growth, and currency adjusted DGG would be at 10%. So that\\'s with the whole thing, that gets us to the 0 percent, which is, corresponds to the high-end of our guidance at $7.1 billion on the currency-adjusted and organic basis. And then are you able to comment at all on the China book-to-bill and just kind of latest trends there. I know you talk qualitatively about it a minute ago, but...? Well, the China business, again, clearly compounded with the projected slowdown in Communications, plus the push out of deliveries, overall China was relatively flat just because the result of that. The Chemical Analysis business essentially was in the very low-single digits. The Life Science business though, had a substantial growth in the quarter, exceeding 20%. Okay. And then are you able to talk on pricing, I know you had a couple of comments on competitive dynamics earlier, but can you talk about whether pricing trends may have impacted margins? We had said that at the beginning of the year that we had -- we\\'re going to target our manufacturing cost savings to offset pricing. This quarter, Didier did say the number that we thought that we could get $40 million of gross margins out, and actually make a contribution. So to date, even though there\\'s obviously, point deals where there\\'s margin pressure, the fundamental discounts have not -- have gotten a little bit weaker, but have not changed substantially. And I guess on that margin comment, I mean margins are always back-end loaded in the year. But if we look at the guidance you\\'ve laid out, I mean you need to average I think about $0.77 in the back half of the year to hit guidance of $0.67 next quarter. That\\'s a little bit of a bigger step up than we\\'ve seen before, and is that just the function of the additional cost workouts? Actually the slope isn\\'t much different than \\'12, given how we started off so slowly in Q1. It\\'s actually, the seasonality is not that different than \\'12. Part of it is the top line. It\\'s operating leverage, because we are seeing what we\\'re hearing what you guys are hearing also, which is the, that the economy will slowly, slowly grow again. And so that is embedded in our guidance. And part of it is just the cost synergies. But the cost synergies, I would say, I mean, are fairly well balanced throughout the remainder of the year. And last one, if the communications market is really kind of slowing here, does this change the secular growth rate of the company across the cycle? Don\\'t read anything more than what we said. Q1 was slower, as anticipated. Given the volatility that we have in the push outs, we are saying that we are planning for a -- the potential for slower Communication. That\\'s it. And it\\'s one view of many. You will have some people saying it\\'s going to be up in the right forever. Some people will say hey it\\'s going to be slowing down because of the investment at this point in time. All what we\\'re saying is that is what our plan is, built into our guidance. And that\\'s our view at this point in time. And if we\\'re wrong, we will capitalize on the upside and if, in fact, it\\'s worse than that, then we\\'ll make the corresponding adjustments. Can you just talk a little bit, the Genomics and Diagnostics business was up 6% on the core growth. The number -- a little bigger number than we were thinking before. It\\'s like, what\\'s sort of driving then? Can you also give us like an update on Dako and where you\\'re starting the product portfolio launch, and how you\\'re seeing -- are you getting -- what\\'s your traction getting right now from SureFISH? All right, I will -- I\\'m going to turn this over to Lars in a second, but I could not be more pleased with the progress that we have been making with Dako, in terms of the integration into a large company without distracting them. And again, hopefully Lars can validate -- or verify that. And then secondly, as you know, Lars has taken over responsibility for all of our Genomics business, as well as our Pathology business to really drive leverage and the -- that integration, on top of that, is going well. So Lars, why don\\'t you go ahead and talk about a little bit about how you see the -- your core Dako business and the opportunity in the new group? Sure. Let me -- take a crack at that. No, I basically agree with that. It\\'s a -- it\\'s been a great journey so far, coming into the Agilent family and we are allowed to do the right things here, which I think is very important. I think we are holding the line with Dako pretty nicely here. So if you look back the last couple of quarters, we\\'ve been able to stabilize our business at the core Pathology level at around 5% organic growth rate. And then -- and relative to the market, Dako is doing better. But it\\'s fair to state, still, that we are not yet up to the speed of the market. We hope that, that traction will change in the course of the next, probably 2 quarters as we will be moving in an unprecedented number on new products that is right now hitting. That\\'s anything from new chemistries to new instrumentation. So basically, we\\'re going to go to market in the next few months with a very broad and diverse portfolio. More specifically, what we believe is going to drive the uptake here on the core Dako business is fundamentally a new, fully automated instrument. And I\\'ve said before that we  foresee a long summer in the midst of 2013, and to characterize that even further, I can say that we are into customer sites right now. And we have run a fairly significant number of both immunities to chemistry at these slides, and the results so far as measured by a group of pathologists is really spectacular. We haven\\'t released the spec of what we\\'re going come with, at this point in time. We will be doing so in the course of the next 4 weeks. But the internal benchmarking that we have would indicate that is going to be a very, very high performing instrument. So stay tuned. There\\'s going to be more information coming out of that. We will be expanding our clinical sites towards the, call it, the second calendar quarter of the year, and I expect us to be into a full swing launch somewhere in the third calendar quarter. So we see this as a terrific upside to build on the strength that we have been able to stabilize with the Dako business. So things are looking good. To break it down per geography, if we look at our core Dako performance, we are probably growing the last quarter in the North American or the U.S., so the Americas business, by around 6%. We are pretty flat in Europe. And the Asia Pacific business, inclusive of Japan, is up around 15%. To breakout the few of the things where we see major traction would be China, where we are growing more than 100%, as an example. So the things are picking up and we are able to leverage the infrastructure from Agilent, and also the incremental investments in field resources that we have put in place. In terms of the Genomics business, I\\'m pleased to say that we\\'ve been able to substantially improve the profitability of the business during the last 12 months. The team has done a great job, actually reducing cost, and actually improving the margins here. We see a good traction with the CGH microarray business getting into the clinic, and we expect that, that penetration will continue, and we\\'re going to benefit from that. That\\'s a very important line for us. So a number of the other Consumables and instrumentations are doing very well and we are pleased to see the progress. And compared to the industry benchmark, I\\'m pleased to say that we are at the level where the industry has been performing in the last 2 quarters. Specifically around the SureFISH, we are having a customer base of, I would characterize that around 150, 270 customers a day actively reordering. The reordering rate is not at the level where I would be pleased right now. So we have made a footprint, but we haven\\'t penetrated to the ability or the potential of the company right now. A few things that we are finding out is the time to validate the new probes get into the accounts takes about a longer time, and we also need to ensure that the we optimize the SureFISH on FFPE on the tissue, all right? And we\\'re going to automate that on top of it. So there are 3 things that\\'s going to happen here the next few months. We\\'re going to have more probes out. Addressing some of the solid tumors. We\\'re going to optimize this on tissue so it can be carried by the Dako sales force and we\\'re also going to automate that on the new instrument that\\'s going to hit in the next, call it, couple of months here. So we are making good progress. We are gaining incremental business, competitive reinstall [ph] business, but not yet up to the potential. And I promise you that\\'s going to be a very important area and a significant growth opportunity for us. Could you walk us through the components of the revenue guidance reduction? You missed the midpoint of revenue guidance by $10 million. You said you would have been, I think, $10 million to $20 million higher if weren\\'t the delays. Recognizing FX has become less of a headwind, you obviously lowered full year revenue guidance by a lot more, $100 million, I believe, at the midpoint. How much of this is Defense? How much of it is Communications, and how much of this is largely other things or maybe just giving yourself a little bit more wiggle room, given the choppy execution over the last several quarters? $100 million for the year, from $7.2 billion to $7.1 billion, $35 million currency, and just split the difference on Defense versus Communication, moving forward. And I think that your comment of trying not have another quarter like this is legitimate. Okay. And I guess I\\'m a little -- it\\'s a little surprising, at least to me, that a key component you\\'re highlighting of having to reduce your revenue guidance is attributable to sequestration, given I think you\\'d agree, how pessimistic you\\'ve been regarding developments or lack thereof in Washington. What exactly were you expecting before for Defense? And how did Defense hold up in January? We\\'ve seen some data, such as the fact that DoD contract awards declined, I think, 42% year-over-year in the month. So is that was something that you called out as being an incremental headwind in the quarter. I\\'m just wondering if you saw anything over the last few weeks? Well, it\\'s interesting. I\\'ll let Guy talk about the U.S. Our Defense business in the quarter was actually up 9%, all driven by non-U.S. purchases. But I\\'ll have -- so again, an anomaly now, but the -- I\\'ll have Guy comment about exactly what they\\'re seeing between the government and the primes. Well, yes, as you heard from Bill, our business really grew because of the international part. In the U.S., we were flat in Q1. And mostly because of the backlog we got in Q4 in orders, and also the year-end money. The budget spending for most of the defense and contractor. So flat in the U.S. and the growth comes from outside of the U.S. with a number of very interesting programs. Russia, for instance, was very strong, but also China in this regard. Going forward, I would say that the one thing that I would just add to the sequestration is the overall continuing resolution that is set up. And that has  a, in fact, a more interesting lever as we really would expect that the government gets to an agreed upon budget. As soon as the budget is set up, this will allow, then, everybody to start investing and making plans going forward. So it\\'s mostly the fact that nobody knows what\\'s happening, rather than the decision of yes or no for sequestration, are we looking for final decision. But if you see award activity actually slowing down, recognizing that, that would not have translated into immediate revenue anyway, but if you\\'re seeing award revenue -- I\\'m sorry, award activity slow down recently, wouldn\\'t that suggest that if there is going to be anything that, is in line with the dynamic you just described, moving past the continuing resolution and having some certainty that it\\'s going to take a little while for that revenue to flow through? Well, that\\'s the big question. It\\'s going to take a while and we just don\\'t know how long. So, so far in the -- what we have in the guidance is we assume there is going to be a budget, and that we are, in the high-end of our guidance, that we will see some orders coming in, mostly at the end of the year. Okay. And last question, could you just talk about the impact of the Lunar New Year being a little bit later than it was last year? How did that play out in January, and how is that being reflected in Q2 guidance? Lunar New Year, again, because of our quarter from October to January, every 4 years, Lunar New Year is in the same as Christmas holidays, which is always a problem for us. Because the Lunar New Year, this year, in fact, is going on right now, at the very beginning of the quarter, there\\'s, we don\\'t imagine any material impact to the Lunar New Year to Q2 whatsoever. Could you comment a little bit on more the general-purpose end market, and just what\\'s your outlook there, given that we are seeing some improving macro variables? And maybe also just what are your -- what do your customers tell you when they decide to push out an order? Is this just based on, we need to make our own numbers, or is there something else going on there? Well, again, we can\\'t make a comment on push out of orders. As I alluded to, we have huge customers. And which I think adds more volatility than if we had thousands of thousands of small, $10,000, $50,000 customers. The top 25 customers average $11 million a quarter. So it doesn\\'t take much at the end. And there\\'s just a variety of reasons why they want something later or not, so I\\'ll just leave it at that, and again we never comment on an individual customer. But Guy, why don\\'t you just go ahead and give an update on what you\\'re seeing in the terms of the overall general-purpose market, and you can put a plug in the continued success of oscilloscopes. Yes, maybe I should start with this, we -- our oscilloscope program keeps our hitting very well our expectations and had another positive growth rate this quarter. And very pleased to this, probably we\\'ll give you more details when we meet in March at our meeting there. The general-purpose market is, I would say, very mixed beside the high-speed digital discussion that I just shared with you on the oscilloscope side. The rest of the market, the cost of the world was down, as you\\'ve seen our industrials for EMG, we\\'re 13% down. And it is based on the macroeconomic concerns still. The PMI is a little bit better than last quarter. But the trend is still too slow for people, really to invest, until the -- unless they have clear production needs so, and this, obviously, is not very clear in the marketplace yet. Well, a lot of my questions have already been asked and answered. But Bill, you talked about order visibility, as it\\'s been very problematic. Is it pretty much just confined to EM? Or have you also seen more volatile order patterns in the Life Science and Chemical businesses as well? The -- it\\'s still predominantly EM, given how big it is, and just the size of the customers are so large. But this quarter, we also -- and again, Mike can comment, we actually saw some unusual push outs, delays in the Chemical Analysis side as well. And so that\\'s new. But it\\'s still predominantly the Electronic Measurement part of the business. I don\\'t know, Mike you have any comments? You\\'ve got a little bit of it, too. Yes, there was actually a silver lining in that story. So Bill is exactly right, that we saw some unexpected volatility at the end of our quarter. As Bill said, he thought we had it nailed on January 16 when we talked with the board. But the good news, the silver lining is what we saw was, a lot of interest in our new launch of our franchise products, and so what we saw at the end of the quarter was, a number of our customers asked us to convert their orders and they were interested in the new products, so that was not part of the -- it occurred at a higher level than we had anticipated, and that\\'s why I said earlier, there\\'s a silver lining there. So that\\'s what we saw the end of the year quarter from the Chemical Analysis side. Yes, these are the 2 highest volume, gas-based products. It\\'s a replacement for our 70, 90 gas chromatograph, and then also our single quad DC mass spec product. Okay. And then a final question, just to confirm, so it looks like you\\'re still expecting the kind of flat to low, or maybe mid-single-digit growth in Chemical Life Sciences for the year? Just one quick question. Didier, when you look at the decremental margin in the EMG business, whether you look at it year-over-year, or you look at it sequentially from fourth to first, is there any mix impact in that decremental? Is that all volume? And should we kind of expect that going forward? Or is there, again, some of the cost take out that you alluded to, is it weighted towards EMG? EMG has, since Q1 of 2012, engaged in a very, very strict hiring freeze and cost controls and things like that. So they are in the process of accelerating those, this clamp down on expenses. But the -- really all of the -- I mean, that helps, but the impact of the loss of operating leverage, the impact of the lower revenue is really what explains all of the decremental. It is all top line because they\\'ve done a really, really good job at managing the expenses. They\\'ve really achieved the goals that we had set for them in terms of, again, incremental, decremental. And in the old days, we would not have seen EMG at that kind of revenue at over 17% operating margin. So it is certainly -- and they are in the process of doing more in terms of discretionary expenses. And Didier, could you also, I\\'m sorry, you whipped through this a little fast, but could you just repeat. Did you suggest that the EMG business now for the year, with sequestration at the midpoint, in the estimate and then also with the comps slowdown, did you suggest, maybe down mid-single-digits is a better... Yes, but that was in line with the high-end of our guidance of $7.1 billion, that EMG core revenue growth currency adjusted would be between minus 4% and minus 5%. I just want a little bit more clarity on some things. So, I\\'m -- as a molecular biologist, and life science analyst, so I\\'m a little more familiar with the other side of the business, the EM business. I appreciate some of the comments you\\'ve made on not thinking that you\\'re seeing share shifts in this business. But I\\'m just curious, it\\'s like, what other evidence out there, where -- how can we gain better confidence that you guys aren\\'t seeing some pressure, particularly in the areas like the wireless testing business. Particularly since some of your competitors like LitePoint are now part of Teradyne? It\\'s -- I\\'m just looking for some better clarity -- metrics in terms of the market share shifts in this areas, like, what can we do to get a comfort level that it, that\\'s just a slowdown in the market and not share loss? Well it\\'s very, very difficult, with the biggest competitor that we have is Rohde & Schwarz, it\\'s a German company and it\\'s private. The battle right now for the wireless handset market in R&D is between Anritsu, Rohde & Schwarz and ourselves. That is by far, the biggest players. Anritsu, of course, had a great run last year, and you can look at their numbers for the last quarter, where they had slowed down, but that\\'s the ballgame. The biggest issue is one of the largest competitors in the space is private. You can clearly get their tax returns when they file backward looking, that\\'s really where the battle is. And it\\'s no disrespect because some of the smaller companies that are playing in the space. But the communication market is $4 billion or $5 billion. You know how big we are, and that\\'s really where the action is, and our biggest competitor, point for point, is Rohde & Schwarz. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\\'s broadcast. I\\'d like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks they\\'d like to make. Yes, thank you, Regina. This is Alicia. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today on the call. And we look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day on the 7th of March. Thank you.

Today, Agilent reported revenues of $1.73 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, inclusive of the Dako acquisition. Adjusted net income was $269 million or $0.77 per share. We exceeded EPS guidance despite continued industry headwinds and macroeconomic challenges. Strong Q2 earnings were driven by our ability to generate higher manufacturing margins while sequentially reducing operating expenses. These improvements demonstrated the strength of Agilent’s business model, which has enabled us to streamline our operations while supporting future growth.  We expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging through the second half of 2013. We are taking additional actions to ensure that Agilent is solidly positioned for the future success and value creation. Today, we announced that $50 million restructuring program to further streamline our operations and reduce our cost structure.  In addition, Agilent’s Board has authorized the doubling of our stock repurchase authorization from $500 million to $1 billion. The repurchase program will be executed by the end of calendar year 2013. Despite current challenges, Agilent is well positioned in our target markets. The integration and leverage of our worldwide manufacturing operation, will continue to drive higher gross margins. We have a deep pipeline of new product introductions and our commitment to customer satisfaction is second to none. Here is some of the business highlights. Agilent’s Q2 orders of $1.69 billion were down 8% over last year including Dako. Revenues of $1.73 billion were flat year-over-year. Operating margins were 19%.  With the acquisition of Dako, we will no longer refer to our life science and chemical businesses as Bio Analytical measurement or BAM. Instead, we’ll use LDA for life science diagnostics and applied chemical markets. Please note this is not an organizational change, we will continue to report life science, diagnostics and genomics, and chemical analysis as separate segments.  Revenue for LDA were $972 million in Q2 up 13% year-over-year inclusive of Dako. Operating margins was 18%. Overall pharmaceutical markets grew 8% driven by technology upgrades.  Academic and Government markets declined 5%. Food safety grew 8%, offsetting softness in the forensics and environmental markets. Petrochemical was up 3%, within LDA, the life science group revenue grew 2% year-over-year, operating margin was 15%.  Performance was led by LC, LCMS and recurring revenues. The new on core multi span liquid handling system for automation division has been well received in the marketplace. Revenues in the Diagnostics and Genomics group grew 124% down 3% organically. Operating margin was 17%. Well currency impacted our Genomics business [CDS] sales remains sales. Targeted Enrichment volumes grew even in the phase of strong competitor pricing underscoring our leading market division. Surface renewals continue at high rate as we continue expand the customer base. We continue to be pleased with the results in Dako, last quarter Dako launched its new advanced staining platform on this, which includes hardware, software and reagents. Placement to begun a key C customer sides and feedback has been excellent. Chemical analysis group revenue group revenues grew 3% year-over-year operating margin was 22%. Our recently introduced GC Q-TOF and ICP triple quad shows solid results. In addition, we introduced the new 7890B gas chromatograph, and the 5977A series single quad Mass Spec as well as a whole new release of our OpenLab chromatograph data system. Electronic Measurement group revenue declined 13% over last year, despite the lower than expected revenues, operating margin of 21% was strong. We are able to maintain gross margins and rapidly reduced expenses and response for the changing environment. Industrial demand was down 17% reflecting weak macroeconomic conditions that are expected to persist in the near-term. Computers and semiconductors also declined by double-digits reflecting the over capacity situation and the weak PC market. Aerospace and defense was flat and oversees sales offset declines in the United States. Wireless R&D was down 1% as customers continue to invest cautiously. Wireless manufacturing was down 26% due to the loss of business from a large customer as we could not agree on terms this year. This will continue to have major negative revenue impact for the rest of FY ‘13. Nevertheless, we continue to see opportunities in wireless manufacturing, we just introduced our manufacturing solution for wireless LAN. We will continue to invest in market leading wireless test solutions in both R&D and manufacturing. We’re excited with our upcoming product launches for the second half of the year.  We’re also in the midst of two significant transformations related to module and handset instruments, while we continue to make invests and bring new products to market. We’re seeing continued double-digit growth year-to-date in our AXI and PXI module platforms. And in our microwaves FieldFox handheld has been well received by the customers. As I indicted, we’re forecasting a weak Q3 due to lower revenue from our wireless manufacturing business and a challenging macro environment for electronic measurement.  In summary, here are the additional actions we’re taking to leverage our integrated and variable business model and to increase Agilent’s financial performance. We will maintain the expense control that we have placed since Q2. These controls enable us to expand margin and exceed EPS even in the phase of lower revenues. As part of the $50 million restructuring I mentioned earlier we will reduce Agilent’s overall workforce by an additional 2% or 450 employees. This is on top of the manufacturing restructure that is already been initiated.  Finally, we will increase our stock repurchase program by $500 million to $1 billion to be completed within the calendar year. We now expect FY‘13 revenues at $6.75 to $6.85 billion which is at the low end of our previous guidance. We expect FY’13 adjusted EPS of $2.70 to $2.85. Our ongoing expense controls, restructuring, and additional stock repurchase programs announced today are expected to absorb most of the impact of the lower revenue on our EPS. While we face a tough operating environment, we\\'re executing the right strategy for Agilent to benefit from a market recovery when it occurs. We have built a strong foundation for growth by safeguarding our profitability while capitalizing on opportunities for the future. We believe this strategy will enable Agilent to build and sustain shareholder value. Thank you for being on the call.  Thank you Bill and hello everyone. As we have stated the low end of our revenue guidance assumed that the sequester would take effect on March 1. Our Q2 revenues were $8 million below the low end of our guidance, a difference that was entirely due to the $12 million negative impact from currency exchanges. Q2 EPS on the other hand were $0.07 above the high end of our guidance as we executed on our commitment to significantly curtail discretionary expenses as long as the economic environment remains highly uncertain. To recap the quarter, co-orders which exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions were down 12% year-over-year while core revenues decreased 4%.  However our operating margin at 19.3% was on par with last year\\'s 19.5%. By segment, EMG core revenues 12% year-over-year, CAG was up 5%, LSG was up, and DDG was flat year-over-year.  By region, core revenues were down in the Americas by 7%, Europe by 2% and Japan by 7% and flat for the rest of Asia Pacific. Our strong 19.3% overall operating margin, 20.5% for EMG and 18.3% for LDA, demonstrates that we have come a long way since 2009 when we also experienced tough economic conditions that severely impacted EMG and to a lesser extent LDA. Back then, our overall operating margin was about 7% even after the temporary 10% pay cut. Clearly the actions we have taken to reduce our fixed cost structure, leverage the scale and integration of Agilent order fulfillment and global and infrastructural organizations, as well as our acquisition strategy have paid off nicely. We did not eliminate EMG\\'s sensitivity to the macroeconomic environment, nor the lumpiness of some markets, but we did reduce significantly the bottom line volatility. Regarding cash, we generated $315 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. We bought back 3.3 million shares for $140 million and have a net cash position of $225 million. Now turning to the guidance for the full year. The low end of the revenue guidance provided last February, which again assumed the sequester would be effective March 1 was $6.9 billion. Since then currency changes have had a negative impact of $50 million versus the last guidance. In addition, there is no sign yet of a macroeconomic recovery and PMI indices are stuck around 50. We are now expecting fiscal year \\'13 revenues to range from $6.75 billion to $6.85 billion, a 1% reported year-over-year decrease at the midpoint, which translates into a 3% core revenue decrease, reflecting the loss of the wireless manufacturing business Bill talked about.  On the cost front, our global order fulfillment organization is on track to generate about $50 million of savings, and our control of discretionary expenses will be maintained in the foreseeable future. Those actions, coupled with the benefit of the incremental $500 million stock buyback will offset most of the impact of lower revenue projections and currency headwinds on our EPS, which is expected to range from $2.70 to $2.85. Finally, moving to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion. At the midpoint, reported revenue would be down about 5% versus last year with EMG down about 19% and LDA up about 10% including Dako and up 5% excluding Dako.  Excluding the impact of the wireless manufacturing business lost, EMG would be down about 8%, reflecting the sequester, and the ongoing challenging micro economic situation. We will continue clumping down on discretionary spend and we will start seeing the first savings from the additional restructuring program in the third quarter. We expect Q3 EPS of $0.60 to $0.64.  Thanks very much. Bill, on the wireless manufacturing customer, again, is it single customer? I assume it’s a contract and did the contract come to fruition only recently or after the Analyst Meeting? And I guess, thirdly, can you give us any additional details around or is there any additional negotiations that could occur, are you assuming that this is just totally lost effectively throughout at the end of the year, and if you decide to do this again next year, you are not even banking on that? And I’m trying to understand what happens with other customers that know that this occurred with this single customer? Thanks very much. First of all, when we used to say negotiation has been going on for long period of time, Agilent’s not at liberty to share specific terms of the agreement, but I can say that the terms exposed to Agilent to significant penalties under certain conditions that we were not confident we could prevent without jeopardizing our ability on our commitments to other customers. Effectively, committing to one customer at the expense of other customers is not consistent with our policies and practices. And so, it’s very clear, very specific opportunity and right now, assuming that it will not come back. So, I bet obviously this is large [and loom]. So this is $215 million a year, isn’t my calculating that about right, as far as the size of this? We, of course, don’t talk specifically related to individual customers at all, but it can be assumed that our one-box-tester related to wireless manufacturing test will be down $230 million year-over-year. The quarterly impact in Q3 to EMG is 75% of its decline in Q4, 72% of its decline is related to the drop of one-box-tester business for wireless manufacturing. Okay. I’m kind of curious. It’s hard to see how they could put you in box, but this is a pretty big order. I’m not sure there are many other people who could deliver something like that. So, can you help us understand a little bit more how you lost leverage here? Was another competitor that just really swooped in and really brought it to a hit? As I said, we could not accept the significant penalties under certain conditions. Typically, these are always around guarantee of supply. If in fact there’s a supply interruption and Agilent, as I said, is not consistent with its policies or practices to commit to one customer at the expense of others. Okay. So, in the second quarter then, April quarter, you guided impact through 3Q. How much is there impact in 2Q and a little more discussion about what’s happening in, say, the industrial spaces or any signs of life here in May? So, I will answer the question regarding our one-box tester business was affected EMG’s year-over-year revenue impact by 31% of the decline.  Yeah, this is Guy. So, clearly, as you probably have seen in our report, our industrial computer and semiconductor business declined 13% in Q2. On the computer and semiconductor we declined 18%, clear on the continuing weakness of the semiconductor business saw capacity slow, and there is also a pause in the technology that we have been benefited from in the past.  On the other side, also as Bill said in his remarks, the computer business is in a transition between PC and tablets and this has slowed down quite some investments in test and measurement. So, for now I would say ICS segment is probably still going to be in a low for the rest of the fiscal year and this is what we had planned for. So, right now what you say that a lot of the PC manufacturing are just swapping the test and instruments over to the tablet manufacturing without forecasting anything? Well, it\\'s not as clear. Our tablets require different type of products for test and in fact require less products for test. So there is a transition not only on the manufacturing side but also between the different companies that do them. And as you remember we also provide a lot of test equipment for the PC board manufacturers, the board stuffing verification or as we call it board test, which of course is always dominated by these big consumer products. Okay thanks for the question of. So Bill looks like obviously, a tough environment you’re now finally making decision to restructure the business a little bit more aggressively and stepping in on the buyback which I think are encouraging steps, but can you maybe give a little bit more detail around where the restructuring is taking place, any specific businesses or geographies? So in regards to the restructuring, we are going to take the opportunity to look for opportunities to streamline our organization around the world, but needless to say the biggest impact of the restructuring will be in our Electronic Measurement Group given the drop in revenue and the likelihood of it not recurring.  We have not made any statements at all in terms of where the restructuring is happening around the world, but… Okay. And then, Bill if I think now for the last couple of quarters, obviously you’ve maintained a phenomenal margin, given the tough top line, it looks like is that model out, kind of your guidance for the rest of the year, that you’re expecting a fairly substantial decline in the operating margin despite some of these initiatives that you highlighted, so would you mind just kind of breaking out, I guess your revenue and margin expectations for the different business units for the back half of the year? Yeah, I can talk about for the full year. At the midpoint of the guidance, on the call basis, we would have EMG at about 11% year-over-year decline, core revenue declined year-over-year at the midpoint of the guidance for the full year, CAG at about 3% to 4% revenue increase, LSG 3% to 4% revenue increase, DGG about 10% revenue increase for the full year, if I take LSG together it’s about 4% to 5% and that would correspond to Agilent at minus 3%. And regarding the operating margin, at midpoints we’re getting to an operating margin of slightly over 18%. So it is no, I’m looking at, it is versus in Q2 and in Q1 we had 17.2%, in Q2 19.3%. So it’s about staying at around the same levels for the rest of the year at midpoint. The impact of being in Q3 and then our typical recovery into Q4, and to the point, the average will be actually roughly what it is in the first half. That’s helpful guys. It looks like Q3, it’s a significant step down. Q4, it comes back up as it does historically, but maybe just as a group given the initiatives on the gross margin side on the LGA side, just any insight in terms of what you expect for EMG margins in the second half versus the LGA margins. Yeah, I mean, for the full year EMG margin would still be north of 18% at midpoint and then all the other one, I mean, again CHG north of close to 22% and LSG over 15% and DGG close to 14%. The same situation for Q3 and CHG for the short-term is going to be impacted but again very, very respectable and then we will have a strong recovery in Q4 and EXT-C wireless manufacturing business, EMG effectively is going to be flat sequentially from Q2 as they move into a lot easier comparison so there is any consolation to our situation Guy and the team have easier comparison moving forward.  Okay, that’s all. I’d like to speak one last, and Bill on Dako you both are the two major competitors that I’ve talked about actually some pretty tough business on the advanced training side. I think partly driven by the fact that the guidelines are no longer requiring negative controls there. So I don’t know just any, can you just let us know how Dako did relative to expectation. Thanks. Sure, Lars, why don’t you go ahead and talk about the organic growth rate from Dako and again, I mentioned one tough year-over-year comparison now being a US company.  Sure, it’s true that in the last two quarters we’ve seen the overall market growth rate being slight to nearly 10%, I would probably say that the last two quarters have been around 6% to 7% growth rate overall. So indeed the market has come down and that\\'s mainly driven from the fact that you have some changes call it in the legislation or the recommendation in the US. We do think that that is going to pan out, so we probably will have to bleed through another two quarters until we are into an annualized impact of that where the market again is going to kick up, so also it’s true that the market has been somewhat slower in the last two quarters.  Now back to the question around Dako, how is Dako doing well. Look at the performance currency adjusted Dako grew this quarter at 4%. If we in all fairness look at the real compared to prior year and we exclude some of the sale that Dako made to [involve] those countries that didn’t recur as we pick this year, Dako was actually up to 6%. So fact we actually tell you that Dako is improving in its performance and the market seems to be at least temporarily and now taking down. So, if I compare to the two companies that was out reporting as before us, it’s probably fair to say that our coproduce time was pretty respective. Thanks for taking the call. Bill and Didier, so maybe you can comment on the buyback, the additional $500 million. I think it should be well received just, is this cash on-shore or just something that you had to do it kind of get it on-shore to access, and secondarily, what kind of elected the decision now to kind of step up the buyback, given, I think you have been kind of reluctant to do so given the inability there excess of cash? Thanks. So, I’ll take the first question. So, it will be a mix of cash on our balance sheet and some debt, the funding of the incremental $500 million. And as many of you know, we have to go back to the market this quarter to refinance $250 million tranche of coming debt. We will do that. We will take debt to pay for the restructuring and we will bring on additional debt along with repatriation of cash during the course of the year to meet this commitment of additional $500 million of stock repurchase. And then, was this anything that relates to your view of kind of the world now, in terms of where the stock price is today and the expectation of what the outlook is, or is it just a decision that, because I thought in the past you weren’t willing to kind of take on debt to buy back stock. So I’m just wondering what was kind of the trigger to see you guys step up and implement this more aggressive stock buyback plan? Well, first of all, I think that the management team with the Board’s support, having bought back $9.5 billion of the stock since 2005 as well as instituting a dividend, in fact has been very aggressive of returning cash to the shareholder. The issue is always about what the right balance is in terms of our debt load, cash generation and the macro environment. We are still quite confident. Even though we’re disappointed that the second half is not going to recover as strongly as we expected, we’re still looking for continued growth into 2014. As Didier said, our cash generation continues to be very, very robust. We have an opportunity to refinance anyway, and so to be able to easily afford without having any major impact on what the future of the Company or overall credit rating, the announcement of the additional $500 million seems quite prudent. Great. And then maybe you kind of touched upon just now in that answer Bill, but, I know probably last call, you had indicated that despite the end of quarter shortfall that you were pretty constructive about the opportunity in 2013 and hence you didn’t want to cut too deeply. So, just maybe as an update like how you’re viewing the world today, and maybe you can just give kind of an updated view of what you’re seeing from kind of the global economy and how you’re positioned for the remainder of the year. As you know, I’ve been one of the more negative CEOs in terms of growth prospects in the U.S. and Europe. I must admit I had a moment, particularly on the Analyst Day that I actually thought there was some likelihood of a recovery in the second half of the year and it’s just the hard reality. It’s not happening. The continued issues in the U.S. and Europe, Japan stimulus hasn’t kicked in. China is going to grow at 7.5% to 8%. We are not going to get the type of revenue growth that is going to be able to maintain our margins. I was very clear on the Analyst Day is that we know what it takes to do to be able to drive increasing margins and given that the likelihood of our business, not growing into our operating model. Again, the 4% organic growth rate, as a company, we are taking the appropriate actions moving forward and we will execute that as efficiently and quickly as we can. Bill, in terms of the formal guidance reduction, I’m curious if there was anything that really changed in the macro environment beyond the one discrete customer loss and then how would you characterize your ability to do more on the cost front and restructuring side if the second half doesn’t pan out as expected? So, on first question, as Didier said, in terms of the guidance, half of it is strictly currency. Again, as you know, for example, have a large amount business inside of Japan. The other part of the business is tied to our Electronic Measurement that Guy talked about. Industrial is not coming back and we have continued pressure on the computer and semiconductor. And particularly, in some of our semiconductor cap lines we’re the only supplier. So, this has nothing to do with market share or anything. It’s just a tough environment moving forward. We try to balance the long-term growth prospects of the Company versus the short-term operating needs and we’ll continue to evaluate that. I believe as difficult it is as to lay off 450 people, we are highly confident that that will not have an impact on our long-term growth opportunities, have a major impact at all to our new product introduction, our ability to expand in emerging markets. We, at this point in time, do not see a scenario where you’re going to have to see a additional dramatic decrease of revenue unless there was some sort of new economic crisis. And let me just add one clarification regarding the loss of this wireless business, the wireless manufacturing business. I mean, that was already taken out from our guidance in February or in March at the Analyst Meeting. This is not a new element. The reason why we are talking about it now it’s on a year-over-year basis, it does explain both, especially for Q2 and Q3 and a little bit for Q4 some of the significant reported or projected reduction in revenue for EMG. Versus what I had communicated, I think sometime in November in fact where I had said that our operating cash flow would be about $1.25 million and about $220 million in CapEx. We’re now down more to $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, little bit over that between $1.1 billion and $1.15 billion and still the same level of CapEx. So basically the reduction is both the restructuring program and the reduced profits versus what we have said in November. So it’s about a reduction of about $100 million, still over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Good afternoon. I guess a multi-part question for I guess Guy or Bill, is, within this lost wireless manufacturing business and outside of kind of the guarantee supply issue that you previously discussed, Bill, was pricing a major impact to the contract negotiation with this large customer? Was this business won by traditional competitor or one of the newer entrants into wireless test, and was this business margin dilutive relative to the EMG average? Yeah, we\\'re not going to go into the details of specific deal, other than the fact that we are very, very competitive in this space. We have some of the highest gross margins in the industry as the business unit is moving forward. And we have said very, very clearly, the issue is related to terms. Okay. And then I guess, Guy, on the communications front, are you still seeing better infrastructure trends relative to your, obviously, the handset manufacturing but to the R&D test? And then can you comment on some of the geographic trends within infrastructure, and then thoughts, perhaps, any thoughts you might have on timing of China Mobile investments? Yeah, on the infrastructure side, especially the base station, we have not seen major shift and changes happening yet in Q2. We won a couple of deals in China around TD-LTE that could be a premise of what\\'s happening going forward. But it\\'s really very early and everybody is waiting for China Mobile to do really the request for proposal for the base station suppliers. So we don\\'t know yet who is going to get this business and when, so it\\'s very difficult to predict frankly as we are waiting on this one for a number of quarters now.  Okay. And then I guess Bill, I am sorry if I missed this, you might have already commented on this but I think within guidance you\\'d previously said that, from a revenue perspective you are anticipating a 10% impact to your defense business because of sequestration and in worst case of 20%. Is that still how we are looking at it? Any update there post some details you guys picked up on March 1st? Yeah, again I think the guideline is fine. I will let Guy make a comment because the U.S. defense business was not great, but we had no outstanding performance in Europe and Japan. So Guy, why don’t you give us the latest update on the overall defense business… Yeah, the overall defense business in fact we finished flat versus last year in terms of revenue and mostly driven by the business outside of the U.S. So clearly places in Europe like Russia are very strong in satellite and other defense investments and this is helping. As I said, I think I commented at our (inaudible) surveillance is another business that is going very well and we won large deals in Japan for instance that helped.  On the other side in the U.S. it is clearly as we were expecting, even a little bit lower. The DoD orders were 50% even more than 50% down compared to what we had last year. I would also comment that the sequestration to the U.S. has a broader effect on the wider, smaller companies that we probably have classified more into industrial as everybody is waiting a little bit to understand what\\'s happening in the defense business. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to revisit the capital allocation question. I do think that increased buyback here was a positive step, but I was hoping maybe you can give your shareholders a little more visibility on the longer term value creation process on the context of this growth environment certainly think that under or at least appreciate the operating environments are challenging, but it would be helpful if you can talk a little bit more about how you are thinking about use of cash for the longer-term? Our position on the use of cash has not changed at all. Our first priority is to continue to look for acquisitions that help drive our overall growth instituted to the Company. The bulk of the $4.5 billion of investment we have made in acquisitions since 2005 have been in the healthcare area. And as you know, in Life Sciences and Chemical and Diagnostics and in 2005 our Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis business was $1.5 billion and this year we’re on the verge of getting to $4 billion, and $1.5 billion of that revenue is through acquisition. So, we will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our growth in this part of our business, the LDA part of our business. Secondly, is our obligation to return excess cash to the shareholders. We have clearly demonstrated that over the last eight and a half years, both through stock repurchase and this year a 20% increase in dividend, and we will continue to look at ways to tax effectively bring cash back into the U.S. We’ll continue to be able to look at our debt capacity and ensure that we make the trade-offs not only for the short-term opportunity, but for the long-term health of the Company. That’s very helpful. And then maybe just on the first time you mentioned regarding M&A in Diagnostics, you obviously have a start there with Dako, but seems to me that most of the competitors you have in that space have a broader range of offerings there, and my thought is that the asset prices there tend to be pretty rich relative to your ROIC hurdles. So I guess, the question is, have you guys seen any abatement in the price tags for the assets you’d want to bold on to Dako? No. Well, we haven’t. Again, we’re a conservative company. We feel very fortunate that we were able to acquire Dako and not have the deal jumped. It’s a very competitive environment and we have chosen not to participate in these competitive decisions moving forward. I do believe that the culmination of our Genomics business and our Pathology business is the right fit and we need to continue to look for holes in our portfolio in this space that we have. And maybe Lars, maybe you could talk a little bit, now that you’re managing both parts of the business for the last few quarters, your thoughts of the synergy between the Genomics business and your Pathology business and how you look at the environment for potential acquisitions. Sure Bill. So, obviously a little rough to come out and take a shot at potential acquisition and targets here, but somewhat around the thinking here, I mean, two things are coming to play here. Clearly technologies from our Genomics Solutions Division is going to find its way into the Clinical Lab channel, covered by the Dako folks. So, basically we’ll see kind of more of a validated regulated play from the organization for the array business. We hope that we will be plugging some of the holes in our sequencing offering. I mean, we have a great basically HaloPlex offerings or select offering. We are looking at how we can complement that with let’s say other tools at this point in time and we are deeply diving into the opportunities in that market that we see here. And clearly, the Dako channel is going to be able to leverage what comes out of the GST organization and we’re going to play that partially into cyto labs, but obviously into the core channel that we have in the core pathology area. That’s going to happen. We have a fairly, call it, exhausted list of opportunities that we are looking into. A path will be passed at this point in time on the key areas and potential targets that we are looking at. But I would expect that in the next couple of months, maybe even the next year or so that you’ll see the organization DGG being fairly active in a few areas, let\\'s put it this way at this stage. Thanks. Didier, can you just help me bridge the midpoint of your earnings guidance change. You had about $0.08 difference between your current and your previous guidance. Can you just help breakdown the parts there? Yeah, let me take a shot at it. So at midpoint, there\\'s $200 million reduction in the top line and that would translate to about $140 million reduction in gross margin. And then we have various cuts in discretionary expenses. We have the restructuring savings. All in all, as Bill and I mentioned, I mean, those savings offset a big chunk, most of the impact of the lower revenue. So, on an operating profit basis, it\\'s about $40 million reduction instead of starting from $140 million to about $40 million, and that would about translate into $0.10 of EPS deterioration and then the impact of the buyback is about $0.03. So a $0.02 to $0.03, so you get to the $0.08 that you mentioned. And then the second part, I want to make sure I heard this right, you said the $200 million in revenue reduction, none of that is due to this, the manufacturing customer loss, you said you already included that in the previous guidance. Yeah, absolutely, very little, there was some, I always hope that the upside, that perhaps we will get something. But most of the reduction doesn\\'t come from February to the May guidance doesn\\'t come from that lost business. Again this lost business has a bigger, has big explanation of the year-over-year variance but not in the change in the guidance. I just need to sneak one more in. Can you just talk about pharma, biotech and academic government performance in April and kind of just the cadence through the quarter of those two segments? Thanks. Yeah, so we\\'re seeing some continued strength in pharma. In fact there\\'s been an upward momentum across the quarter. So it was really strong. In fact, in the U.S., it was fairly strong with a lot of investment going into new sites for biotech R&D in the pharma sector. Academic government, it is very weak and a lot of that weakness is the U.S. sequestration and the offshore impact. As you know, there is connected grant giving between U.S. government and other governments. So the academic government as we told you, was down about 5%. If you looked at the macro for LSG, that represented about a half a point drag on us in the quarter. So that\\'s kind of our view. Bill, obviously, last quarter you were a bit frustrated by the lack of visibility that you were being afforded. Would you say that visibility has gotten worse at this point or in light of the way that the quarter has unfolded, it is pretty much the same as it was in February? Excellent question, and I’m going to have Ron answer the question because that has been one of the more frustrating areas in trying to predict where our ultimate earnings are going, and even in this quarter, as you know, our earnings were well above the midpoint of our guidance through heroic efforts of Ron and the team. So, Ron, why don\\'t you share some of your findings on causes of unpredictability and what we\\'re trying to do to manage through it? The biggest challenge that leads to the unpredictability is the last $20 million to $40 million worth of revenue that we\\'re trying to ship and get through and have customers accepts before the end of the quarter. So what we\\'ve seen is a continual delay or people dragging their feet by making the final purchases and actually getting the approvals through. Then we have to go ahead and ship the product, get it installed and make sure that it gets signed off. And the last week or two of the quarter is where the whole ballgame has been won or lost. We saw this in Q3, and in Q1 it was also pretty tough. But again, it\\'s very hard to predict, it all depends on when the customers need the orders at the end of the quarter, and that has tended to move revenue over the quarter boundary. But we\\'re working very hard at trying to understand what the customer needs are, trying to be a little bit more conservative in what we project and as you saw in the last quarter we pulled all the stops out on expenses and that caused us to be at $0.77 over the top.  Our guidance methodology has not changed. The high end of our guidance is our best view of what will happen. The lower end of the guidance is our guess forecast of what is the likely volatility due to the issues that Ron just described. Okay. And then maybe just to go back to 1Q, you were able to recognize all the revenues that that got pushed off in the last week of the quarter? Okay. And then maybe on the CAG side, growth in petrochem was a little bit better than I would have thought just given the industrials commentary from some of your peers. Is that really a function of the new GC introductions? I guess what is your outlook for the market growth in those areas for the next couple of quarters? Sure, Bill. I think the slight recovery you saw in the chemical end of the space is really driven by the emerging markets in Asia. I don’t think it points to an overall fundamental strong recovery yet in the global market space. Although the new product that Bill referred to earlier launched in Q2 or shipped in Q2 did have an impact, but I think I would really point to the geographic strength in China and other emerging economies. Hi, this is actually Brian Kipp on behalf of Paul. Can you guys discuss, I guess you saw some strength in Japan on the aerospace side, but with the bad currency translation, I just wanted to kind of hear you what you guys were thinking, what you saw in the quarter coming out of Japan and what kind of impact it had. And then just for your 2013 guidance what the spot rate you guys have on the FX translation for the… Didier, why don’t you give the overview on Japan and Holland, and Bryan if you have any follow-up questions by product line? Yeah so, in terms of how we guide in regards to currency, there has been no change in our process, in our methodology. We take the spot rate as of the last day of the previous quarter and we assume that will be the rate for the rest of the remainder of the year. We are hedged as you know overall on the 100% for the first quarter and then on a declining basis over three to four quarters. We are also have in general well pretty structurally hedged also having a huge footprint in the most of the regions.  However, clearly in Japan we have less cost than we have revenues in yen and therefore like other companies we will, our operating margin will be impacted by the weakening of the yen. But because of our hedge that impact is not felt yet completely in the present quarters and will be felt over time. And then regarding Japan, let me give you the numbers, so overall, we saw Japan down on a GAAP basis about 14%, but then when you take into account, that is on the reported basis, but on the core basis it\\'s down 7%. Okay, thank you. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you guys did a great job on pulling through some of these cost controls in the quarter, and just kind of wanted to get a more color on there. I remember during the Analyst Day, you said there was about seven sites that continue or continue to be in process of consolidation, have those been consolidated for your guidance for the $50 million in incremental cost savings? Are those all in there or are those more outer years in 2014 and 2015, and if so if you guys can, can you pull some of those forward to recognize some additional cost savings in \\'13? All right, I will have Ron answer the questions regarding the $50 million of manufacturing cost savings. Again that was previously announced moving forward for the status update. The $50 million that we announced today are all out of our expense structure and are in addition to the $50 million that were related to manufacturing and the sites that you referred to. So, Ron, why don\\'t you give an update again on our manufacturing and consolidation? Our manufacturing and restructuring program is right on track. We have a multiyear program that we\\'ve talked about at Analyst Day that adds up to, close to $200 million and we\\'re about one-third of the way through that and we are on track to deliver according the schedule that we outlined before, and as Bill mentioned, this additional $50 million is that of OpEx in addition to that program. I was hoping to get more color on the pacing of sequester\\'s impact in your non-EMG businesses. So, sequester hit March 1, but were there differences in behavior through the month of March as reported to the month of April, was there any benefit from folks having certainty or did you see that 5% hit across Academic and Government in a pretty linear fashion across the months and the quarter. Yeah, the sequestration wasn\\'t linear. People seem to think that they were going to be able to spend in March and so there was a little bit of noise and still some spending in March and then I think the reality that it might be a protracted discussion started hitting towards the end of March. So, we saw stronger breaking, remember that we had already being breaking from the beginning of the calendar year. But we saw stronger breaking as we got towards the end of March and April. So, really that\\'s kind of non-linear. Going forward it\\'s probably at the full the full breaking mode, which on the global basis you\\'re talking about 1.5% roughly of the life science market and we are not fully exposed. So we\\'re going to do less than a percent, but it\\'s a drag on everybody until it\\'s clear or resolved in a positive way. Okay. Thank you. Then for my follow-up question, Didier, the EPS build you\\'re looking for from Q3 to hit the midpoint of your full year guidance, Q3 to Q4. Is it bit larger than usual? So, do we think about that? Is it the timing of the benefits from the share repurchase and the restructuring, is that what\\'s using the extra quarterly boost or is there something else we should we thinking about as we roll into Q4. No, I mean, in Q4 if you do the math we’re taking the midpoint of our revenue guidance for Q3 and the midpoint guidance for Q4. You can see that we\\'re expecting revenue to be up about $100 million between Q3 and Q4 and that translates obviously into our higher EPS. Then you do have the impact of the buybacks, the overall $0.02, $0.03. There is more of an impact obviously in Q4 than Q3. And then the restructuring, the $50 million also Q3 will see just very, smaller amount of benefits yet of savings and we\\'ll start seeing some significant savings in Q4 going into Q1 of next year. Hey, thanks. I\\'m wondering with the restructuring actions you\\'ve discussed here, is the portfolio review on the table? I\\'m just thinking are their particular product lines or areas that you would maybe want to revisit, and if not, can you just talk about why commit to spending the same level of R&D for the communications business given how problematic it\\'s been? So, first of all So, first of all, we have a long history of evaluating product lines and businesses that fit in Agilent\\'s long-term strategy, and we\\'ve made the corresponding adjustments. At this point in time, we are very happy with our overall product portfolio and so we have no short-term plans to divest, for example, particular product line moving forward. If you look at our research and development spending, it has actually come down two points over the last year from 12% of revenue to roughly coming down to 10%. If you do a weighted average of the Electronic Measurement business and our LDA business, while we have a slight highly bias on R&D on the LDA, slightly lower on Electronic Measurement, we are right at the weighted average of the market moving forward.  And so, Guy has taken the adjustments in EMG accordingly. We\\'re focusing on the opportunity, particularly focusing on module instrumentation and handhelds as well as being a leader in the very high-end feature-rich instruments. So I feel very good in terms of the level of R&D that we\\'re spending and particularly excited as I said about the pipeline of new products that we\\'ll be introducing in the second half of the year. And then maybe one for Nick, I know you had a question earlier on kind of the biopharma markets, 8% growth really kind of stands out relative to the peers. Can you talk about how much of that was mass spec versus LC, and are you pulling share, and also, how much of that is coming from service? Yeah, so mass specs continues to be a strong platform for us. I would say, relative to share of LC and mass spec we\\'re holding our own. I wouldn\\'t say we\\'re outrunning the competition. You guys will see all the numbers from everybody on that. But we really saw there was a good, for lack of a better term, an easy compare in some of the geographies. So, India is coming back a bit. It was kind of flat. It\\'s been pretty negative. China looked pretty strong. So, and I said the Americas, so, it was as much a compare on the pharma and momentum as a specific product. And the pharma guys continue to go with the technology upgrade. So there is legs in that. And then last one on environmental forensics, I know that was soft. I don\\'t know if Mike has any comments on the outlook for that market. Was the weakness more biased toward Europe? We\\'ve heard that from some of the competitors? Yeah, thanks for the opportunity to share some insights here. So, it\\'s both Europe and the U.S. And the story here is continued weak government funding at both the federal and state level. So if there is one silver line, it does continue to be the emerging market; specifically, China, and you may have recently seen the announcement coming from new leadership about the Chinese dream and how they\\'re going to be the guiding principles to improve the standard of living in China. Now, that will play in very well into the environmental market. But right now, the overall numbers are down given the weakness in both U.S. and Europe. Yes, just a couple of questions either for Bill or Guy. But I wanted to just ask, with this lost manufacturing test customer has there been any change in the test protocol that makes your approach somewhat redundant and expensive relative to the different test protocol? For instance just physical layer test or a signal test, so when you get back to the market next year, do you come back with a different solution? Yes. I will have Guy answer the question regarding our overall solution and the evolution of what is a consumer based product and where testing is going and again I\\'m very excited about the direction we are going. I want to make this explicitly clear, we did not come to terms, we did not come to an agreement on contract based on terms, nothing to do other than that. Guy? Yeah, I would just highlight also that it’s definitely not a product issue or a product at very adequate for this marketplace and have been used in many customers across the world. So, the transformation that you’re referring to each of that’s really something that in fact we have lead to what we call non-call processing test. In the past, people for cellphone would have to test a phone in operation that the phone would have to connect to a base station to be fully tested. Now it is no longer tool for most of the phone test strategies and we have been a leader in helping progressing towards this, and we will keep doing this with the current generation and the future generation of our products. And can I also ask you, Guy, when I look at the EMG orders and the decline year-over-year could you just speak to the decline geographically, and just approximate decline in the three regions, in orders.  Well, if I normalize for the deal that we spoke about, that is obviously in terms of revenue mostly impacting our business in China, because that’s where the largest bases are. I would say the rest of the decline is pretty even across all geographies. So the order and the large customer that order was a China order in the past. Let me just take that question in the way we report our regional orders and revenue equal to have shown as the Americas. It is just when some times we talk about on the ship two basis that our instrument ended up in China. But on the way, we report orders and revenues which would have shown in Americas It would have been. Okay, that’s great. And then just last thought, I just had in terms of the second quarter was there, I am just referencing back to an answer that was given on sales for EMG, where there any order cancellations at the end of the second quarter because given the first quarter order level in EMG and some of the first quarter pushed business into the second. I am curious that your sales number wasn’t a little bit higher on the conversion from the first quarter orders, unless there were some cancellations? Hey, guys. I thought maybe I’d start first on the P&L, can you talk about sort of the margin progression queue to queue. I mean in terms of the 3Q guidance. And I am just trying to look out sort of what the debt in the employee detrimental are, it looks to be more significant obviously then I would have assumed just given sort of the revenue outcomes. So, maybe talk through the components sequentially of what sort of drives that, is it the type of loss business, is it FX, is it sort of the delay on some of the cost flows throughs where you’re getting the savings. I am just trying to understand the Q2 to Q3 margin progression? Sure, so I\\'ll take that one. So, Q2 to Q3, midpoint of our guidance, Q3, I mean sure about $100 million reduction in revenue sequentially. So, again, $100 million in itself that\\'s kind of $0.14 rule of thumb reduction in EPS and what we are showing is EPS going down from $0.77 to $0.62. So on average on the midpoint of the guidance.  So, I think that should answer your question, I\\'m not going to go into the specifics of OpEx and gross margins, but we are obviously, because of the loss of $100 million of revenue, gross margin will be down slightly and then we expect OpEx to be about flattish, but normally, you would expect Q3 OpEx be much higher than Q2, because of the fact that’s just the normal seasonality and that\\'s not happening. Maybe just to follow-up Bill, on Tycho\\'s question in terms of the portfolio, I mean, yeah at some businesses, that last two quarters have performed exceptionally well. Most of the assets are kind of doing what you would expect in this environment or the type of company are but the bits and pieces, whether it\\'s handset where it seems like you have forgone some business and that\\'s going to be down substantial. Then you\\'ve got the semi piece et cetera, they are a bit more volatile than the rest.  I mean as you are thinking about sort of the profile of this business continuing to have these kind of hyper-cyclical pieces, I mean, do you feel like that\\'s something that\\'s going to be a drag on your valuation? Do you think that that\\'s something that sort of makes sense given all the other pieces? I\\'m just trying to get a sense for when you have the internal debate, what are sort of the puts and takes of whether something belongs or doesn\\'t belong? Well, first of all, fundamentally, is the business a good business and one that over a business cycle returns at or above Agilent\\'s operating model. And the situation, I\\'ll use the semiconductor capital business that we kept. We essentially have a 100% market share and as a result of that has just outstanding return through the course of the cycle. And so in times like this, when parts of our Electronic Measurement are going through a tough patch, it\\'s easy to say, hey, let\\'s jettison this for a short-term gain and from our viewpoint, it just doesn\\'t make sense. So, the operating model inside of EMG has been dramatically changed over time. If you had asked me eight years ago, 10 years ago that given the headwinds that they’ve reached, they would have a 20% operating quarter, I would say there is no way. We have a great franchise and with some volatility in the downside and the flipside when this turns around, and semiconductor capital equipment and our small part expands, when you get more growth in the computer side of the house, at some of the industrial growth returns, we\\'re going to have a completely different story. In fact, if anything, we\\'re going to drive higher on the upside in our Electronic Measurement than we\\'ve done in the past, given the decisions that we have made. So, we have a great franchise in these and we will just weather the storm. Yeah, I understand sort of from the business concept perspective, I guess I\\'m trying to understand in the context of sort of what the investment community reflects relative to that volatility. I\\'m just trying to get a sense, when you benchmark internally versus peers, I mean are you looking at a distinct group for the whole asset when you\\'re trying to compare your performance, whether it\\'s on earnings growth, core growth, return on invested capital, cash flow generation, et cetera, and how you do sort of versus forecast versus your peers? Are you copying against a very distinct set of similar companies, where you feel like they have the same asset mix or are you sort of mixing and matching when you\\'re trying to figure out overall. This is why our stock is getting reflected in this way while other peers are kind of having a different view in terms of valuation?  The valuation of Agilent in some of the parts is very straightforward process. Almost everybody has MBA, know how to do the calculation. We often time use third parties to validate our own assumptions moving forward. Our pay system is tied to total shareholder return as you know, since 2005. We have consistently beat all three indexes that we compete in industrial, IT, and healthcare. Clearly, our situation has changed since we have been reclassified into the healthcare sector. The analysts that cover us and the analyst inside of big funds clearly have changed moving forward.  We also of course do that evaluation in terms of what our peers are within the healthcare. As it stands today, based on our evaluation, Agilent and again which has been confirmed from outside help is that we are trading roughly at 12% discount. If you look at the efforts in the short-term to be able to divest to go through the overhead absorption related to that and the distraction for very short-term outlook, we think just doesn’t make sense at all.  Historically, these assets perform well. We will in fact when other handset manufacturing test business, electronic measurement is a great franchise for the company moving forward and to be able to be distracted on I think quite honestly some plastic short-term view. I think just aren’t accurate. If in fact that we were trading at a substantial discount to our peer group or to now they are part of the S&P 500 that we are in. Yeah, that’s a different issue and again we have a long history of addressing that. We made the decision in 2005 to divest semiconductor related businesses and semiconductor component business because it wasn\\'t tied to our strategy of being a leader in measurement science.  So, we continue to be very pleased with our portfolio of products, and that engineering excellence, the foundation of the Company, Electronic Measurement, our financial strength has created just an incredibly competitive franchise in our Life Science Diagnostics and Applied Chemical market, and I think we are very positioned to weather this slowdown and be incredibly competitive as the economy upticks in 2014. And I guess lastly, I\\'ll ask one more simple one. So, I guess on the size of the buyback, I mean, how did you sort of get to the conclusion that that was the right level of debt assumption and sort of the right level of equity purchase. I mean it\\'s now, finally, you\\'ve guided up to $1 billion all-in for the year. So it\\'s more competitive with sort of peers and the S&P. I mean how did you go through the process of pegging about sort of balance sheet optimization and utilizing what is for you? I mean, you just said, you have a depressed level of equity versus sort of your intrinsic value calc sort of capitalizing on that given your confidence in sort of the long-term trajectory of the businesses that you are obviously managing? So we have a every detailed process that we go with the board of directors every year in September where we make a forecast of our three year growth outlook, why we believe we can outpace the market over the period of time, what our P&L looks like in our corresponding balance sheet. Given the operating model that Agilent has developed over the years, so we know we will generate substantial amount of cash. As I said with the previous question, our number one focus is to invest in the businesses going forward. The second one is return cash back to our shareholders tax effectively as we can. So this is an ongoing process that will review with the board officially in September with updates as we move forward balancing what is the short-term outlook for uses of cash for investment in the business, where is the available cash, what is the prudent amount of debt level, ensuring that we remain high caliber credit worthy company. And based on those and ongoing analysis we make the corresponding recommendation to the board on returning additional cash to the shareholder either through a dividend or a stock repurchase. Hi. Thanks, guys. This is Shaun Rodriguez on for Doug, just a couple of follow-ups from me. So you noted food market as the key driver for the Chemical Analysis Group. So I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about this? You talked about China being a driver more broadly here but specific to the food market drivers were there any specific initiatives or guideline changes or anything like that that were behind it and also your views on the sustainability of this impact over the balance of the year?  Sure. I think what you saw in the recently completed second quarter is what you’re going continue to see in the coming quarters, what you’re seeing from past several quarters, the strong overall global growth environment being driven by the globalization of food supply, increasing demands by growth population have, save food to eat and then high-quality food. And what we’re seeing now is real investment line up behind that. So I pointed to China in my earlier comments and as we talked in our previous call, the market looked like was some of the pause because there is a leadership transition under way than you get, little being ministries reorganize and that’s happening and now we’re starting to see or that has happened, we’re starting to see flows of vessels coming in the food market. I really do think this is a global play being driven out of the emerging markets, but not only constrained to those marketplaces. Then you got a great growth environment on the one end on a global basis and you have to have the right products and solutions coming into that space. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we\\'ve had a number of very exciting new offerings coming into the space, whether it be spectrometry products or mass spec, they\\'re all hitting the market and that\\'s really driving the overall market growth that you are seeing from Agilent in a very healthy, while continuing to be a very healthy food market.. Okay, great. Thanks. And then on Dako, can you provide on update where you are with this sales force expansion in Asia, when you will be fully ramped there, what kind of trends you’re seeing in response and also in Dako an update on the formal partnerships you discussed the last couple of quarters and here really put a I am asking about it, are there any specific development or commercial milestones and associated timelines that we should be thinking about? Thank you Sure, Bill. Well, we got the sales force expansion in APAC. I\\'m happy to report that we are pretty much ahead of schedule there and we have completed the hirings as per planned for the full fiscal year. So, the majority of the hirings are going into China. We are probably adding another 25 to 30 customer facing resources. They\\'re now ongoing training and we believe they\\'re going to be, starting to deliver and become operational from the third quarter.  If I look at our development in China right now, Dako year-to-date is growing at around 60%, the base is low, but we are actually placing a great number of instruments, we\\'d see substantially up compared to prior years. So, I think we\\'re making very robust progress and APAC as a region is obviously the fastest growing region for Dako at this point in time. We will continue to drive our business model towards a direct customer access. We have recently completed acquisition of a local distributor in Korea and we will be looking at other opportunities to get closer to the customer and also to capture the value stream of such a transaction going forward. So, Asia, we continue to invest in more footprint in front of the customer. In terms of the pharmDx or Companion Diagnostics as we call it right now, pleased to say that we got a major customer contract where we agreed with Pfizer on a long-term developmental agreement that obviously also comprises some type of advisory services from a regulatory point of view and also marketing point of view and this is subject to support one of the new developments in the pipeline, which is not disclosed by name at this point in time. We also got two important news, [we got to our drag], so basically our HercepTest and the HER2 FISH is the only companion diagnostic today approved to support the use of Kadcyla from Genentech. So we are in a privileged position and we see now an uptick of our business in that regard. In terms of other milestones here, probably fair to say that we will continue to announce more partnerships with Tier 1 pharma companies in this particular field and from fiscal year 2014 and onwards, we do expect to see a steady stream of new companion diagnostic test that will be marketed through the Dako sales organization. Hi, thanks. Didier, I just have one quick question. Can you give us a sense for how we should think about your incremental and decremental margins in an environment where the growth rate is essentially below the bottom end of your business model? Yeah, I mean we covered that a little bit at the Analyst Meeting. I mean, clearly, in order to get the [stick] at the operating model in a very low growth environment, we had to implement cuts and discretionary expenses, and also a very, very surgical kind of restructuring in addition to benefitting from the reduction in the AOF, that the AOF organization has committed to about $50 million per annum for four years in a row. So, that’s how we make it happen. If we were not able to do that, you would normally expect significant decremental when revenue growth has slowed down to such an extent. There are no remaining audio questions at this time. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for closing comments. Thank you, Patrick. Just wanted to say good day to everybody, and thank you for joining us on the call. If you have any questions, please let Elaine or myself know. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2013 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are now in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thank you, Patrick and welcome everyone to Agilent\\'s third quarter conference call for fiscal year 2013. With me are Agilent\\'s CEO, Bill Sullivan, as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s President and Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian. Also joining are the Presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Chemical Analysis, Life Sciences and Diagnostics and Genomics Group, Guy Séné, Mike McMullen, Nick Roelofs and Lars Holmkvist. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an Investor Presentation along with revenue breakups, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Bill and Didier\\'s comments today will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello everyone. Today Agilent reported third quarter revenues of $1.65 billion, a decline of 4% year-over-year including the Dako acquisition. Adjusted net income was $233 million or $0.68 per share. We exceeded EPS guidance despite continued challenges in many of our markets and the economic environment in general. Agilent\\'s strong three earnings reflect our ongoing commitment to actively manage costs and expenses in response to macroeconomic uncertainty. Consistent with the commitment we made in the second quarter, we successfully decreased operating expenses sequentially and we continued to benefit from our focus on reducing manufacturing costs. Before turning to the business highlights, I want to remind you, with the acquisition of Dako, we will no longer refer to our life science and chemical analysis businesses as bio-analytical measurement or BAM. Instead we will focus on LDA for life science, diagnostics and applied markets. As I mentioned last quarter, this is not an organizational change we will continue to report life science, diagnostics and genomics and chemical analysis as separate segments. LDA revenues in Q3 were $951 million up 8% year-over-year including Dako. LDA\\'s operating margin was 18%. In LDA markets, we saw a good growth in pharmaceutical, up 7% on technology upgrades, food and energy also had solid growth up 11% and 6% respectively on strong demand from China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 114% including Dako and 16% organically on good demand for our array CGH and Target Enrichment Solutions. The continued outperformance of these segments was slightly offset by expected year-over-year declines in environmental and forensics and in academic and government, down 11% and 7% respectively. Both declines are a result of the ongoing sequestration in the United States. Our focus on emerging markets continues to pay off. BriC country revenues were up double digits across almost all of LDA, with China growing more than 20% versus a year ago. Within LDA, Life Sciences revenues grew by 3% led by consumables, service, support and informatics. LHG announced several new products in Q3. Two highlights were the 1290 Infinity 2D-LC Solution and our new stream select LC/MS system. 2D-LC provides a pure resolution compared to any other LC based separation approaches. Stream select dramatically increases Mass Spec productivity for our customers. Revenues in our diagnostics and genomics group grew 54% or 6% on an organic basis, operating margins were 15%. In genomics we saw strength in CGH and good demand for our HaloPlex and SureSelect products. Demand for Dako products approached market growth which has slowed to low to mid-single-digits due to softness in Europe and the U.S. We expect the commercial launch of Dako\\'s new Omnis Autostainer in Q4 to accelerate our growth. Omnis feedback from our early customers\\' sites has been excellent. Our expansion of SureFISH into the Dako channel is on track and is expected to gain momentum in FY14. In the chemical analysis group, revenues were up 1% year-over-year, operating margins were 22%, GC sales, notably from China, and reoccurring revenue growth led CAG\\'s results. We saw the beginning of improved replacement market demand as orders increased over our new GC and GC Mass Spec products. A number of new product launches are planned over the next 12 months. Looking forward, we expect mid single-digit growth in Q4 across LDA as new products gained traction and markets that are less impacted by sequestration continue on a positive trend. Turning to the Electronic Measurement Group, revenues declined 17% as projected to $701 million. Operating margins at 18% reflected excellent gross margin management and tight expense controls in response to globally challenging market conditions. Communications revenues were down more than 30% as expected. This was primarily due to the non-recurrence of a wireless customer deal discussed in last quarterly earnings call. Industrial computer and semiconductor revenues declined 11%. Global economies remain weak, while lower PC volumes and fewer technology rollovers required less capital capacity. Aerospace and defense revenue grew 1% with strength in our non-U.S. defense business. Despite challenges in E&G\\'s markets, our investments in transformational initiatives continued to payoff. Module, AXIE and PXI platforms saw another quarter of double-digit growth, while handheld instrumentation continued to perform well. The underlying secular growth drivers in mobility and computing remain strong. As a result, we continue to invest in industry leading test solutions. We are on track to launch several new products for wireless R&D and wireless manufacturing in the coming months. Looking ahead, we expect the uncertainty Electronic Measurement macroeconomic environment to continue into Q4 with continued softness in communications, industrial, semi, computer markets As a result, we are forecasting EMG revenue to decline by low-teens in Q4. Last quarter, we announced that Agilent\\'s board of directors doubled our authorization under the current stock repurchase program. This brought our total authorization to $1 billion, inclusive of the amounts repurchased since November 1, 2012. Agilent repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock in the first half of 2013, and repurchased an additional 15 million shares during the third quarter. We have now utilized $900 million of our total authorization. We expect the program to be completed by the end of calendar year 2013. Overall, we believe we are exercising the right strategy to create long-term value for Agilent shareholders in this environment, [Agilent\\'s] for the future. We continue to invest in high growth opportunities including communications, life science, diagnostics and applied in emerging markets. Our commitment to innovation R&D and excellent customer satisfaction remains strong. We have a deep pipeline of new product introductions that will enable us to differentiate and win in our targeted markets. Moving forward, we are focusing our R&D efforts on high growth segments that will drive meaningful revenue growth for the long-term. For the fourth fiscal quarter, we expect Agilent\\'s revenues of $1.7 billion to $1.72 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. Thank you for being on the call. Now, we will turn it over to Didier to more detailed discussion of our financial results. To recap the quarter, Q3 revenues adjusted for $10 million of currency headwinds were slightly above the high end of our guidance and EPS was $0.04 above the high end of our guidance as we continue to drive higher efficiency and manufacturing and SG&A as well as enforced strict expense controls. Core orders, which exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions, were down 5% year-over-year, while core revenues decreased 6%. Core orders at EMG were down 15% year-over-year, or down 8% excluding the non-recurring wireless manufacturing test deal of a key account discussed at last quarter\\'s conference call while LDA core orders were up 4%. Within LDA, LSG core orders were up 2%, CAG\\'s up 6% and DGG\\'s up 6%. Core revenues at the EMG were down 16% year-over-year or down 7% excluding the key accounts wireless manufacturing test deal, while LDA core revenues were up 4%. Within LDA, LSG core revenues were up 4%, CAG\\'s up 3% and DGG\\'s, up 7%. By region, core revenues were down in the Americas by 17% and Europe by 3%, but were up in Japan by 9% and the rest of Asia Pacific by 3%. LDA core revenues grew in all regions where EMG\\'s were down in all except Japan. To note, LDA revenues in China were up 21% after 16% growth in Q1 and 14% growth in Q2. Both, EMG and LDA delivered a strong operating margin of over 18% with more potential for margin expansion and increasing operating leverage as the economy picks up steam. Regarding cash, we generated $215 million in operating cash flow. We issued debt of $600 million during the quarter and paid off $250 million notes maturing that quarter. We also spent $681 million on share repurchases. We also spend $681 million on share repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt position of $315 million. Now turning to the guidance for our fourth quarter, the mid-point of our revenue guidance at $1.71 billion correspond to a year-over-year decline of 1% on a core basis. Made up of a decline of 11% for EMG and a growth of 7% for LDA, including CAG at 6%, LSG at 6% and DGG at 12%, all on a core basis. The mid-point of our EPS guidance at $0.76, represents a sequential increase of $0.08. Finally, the guidance for the full year. The mid-point of our revenue guidance at $6.77 billion is down $30 million from the midpoint of the May guidance, or down $10 million adjusted for changes in currency. EMG is down approximately $20 million, where LDA is up approximately $10 million. At mid-point, we expect EMG revenues to reach $2.89 billion, down 12% on the core basis and LDA $3.88 billion, up 5% on a core basis. Overall, Agilent revenues of $6.77 billion at mid-point will be down 3% on a core basis. Regarding EPS, we are raising the mid-point of our fiscal year 2013 guidance by $0.06 to $2.84. To note, our restructuring plan impacting about 500 employees is on track and most of the $50 million savings would be achieved by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2014. Yes. Just have a couple of questions on the EMG business Bill, could you just layout your expectations for the aerospace defense business? Maybe over the next 12 months to 24 months, when you just think about how sequester plays into the U.S. piece, and is there any visibility offset rest of world there? I mean do you feel comfortable that that can continue to offset most of the sequester decline in U.S.? It is a great question. I am going to have [Gee] make a comment as well. As you know, in the aerospace and defense, the team is really focused on satellite, guiding systems, operational, surveillance, we have been very pleased with our success outside the U.S. I think every quarter is always a nail biter to know exactly where the U.S. is going to end up, so Guy maybe you can make a couple of comments in terms of what you are seeing in the short-term in the U.S. defense spending? Sure. Thank you, Bill. Definitely, as you have seen our revenue was up 1% in this quarter, mostly because of very strong orders from the international business and places like Europe and Japan for some very exciting business I must say around satellites, mostly. Going forward, our Q4 is seasonally usually one of the strongest and highest quarters better for the U.S. DoD and aerospace defense and that is really going to be the key focus. We have seen a number of engagements, so we must say we get a lot of people asking for quotes going forward but the real issue is how much authority and how much budget will these people have in Q4 so that\\'s going to be the big unknown that we have to work through in Q4 now. Okay. Just one follow-up on the life sciences piece of the business, the book-to-bill is seasonally softer than normal. Is there a read into that? Yes. Overall, our orders were just slightly a little bit below what we like going in Q4. I don\\'t think there is any particularly alarm, but I have Nick make a couple of comments in terms of what he is seeing in the life science from order perspective. Yes. Just consistent with Bill\\'s comments. Not exactly where we would have loved it to be but no real alarms, the pharma guys are still very strong and the academic sector is as we said soft with a lot of concern and confusion, so at this point we flushed a lot of backlog, which is a good thing and we are working to recharge that this quarter. Congratulations on being able to get a good quarter under the belt despite the challenges that everyone knows that are out there. I guess, Bill, on the electronic measurement side of the business again, you mentioned obviously there is Apple that you can do the math on the impact that, I am sorry, the big wireless customer deal we can do the math on. You mentioned some new products that you are going to be launching in electronic in handsets manufacturing as well as in R&D. I guess sitting here today, and I know you probably won\\'t give an outlook for 2014, but how are you feeling about where you are positioned from a product standpoint and all the different moving pieces and the comps? What your first take on where do you think that business is going to be doing over the next 12 months all-in? Then again, I will have Didier make a comment as well but overall, I think the communication mobility is going to continue to be a driver for the electronic measurement business going forward regardless of the one customer deal. We have a very strong product position and I am very, very excited about the products that we have in the pipeline. We are not backing away from this market. We are going to continue to invest market share changes overtime but the underlying essentials of the communications market, particularly in this whole area of mobility, radios and every mobile device, I still think is a great opportunity for the company. Yes, and this is Didier. I can add, definitely there is a lot of innovation going into this sector. As you know, there is new challenges because of the spectrometer use and now standards like LT advanced and carrier aggregation and in the wireless networking a lot of new things happening that provides quite some opportunity in R&D and in manufacturing. Our new products portfolio is doing well. We just introduced the wireless connectivity test set that is very focused on testing wireless standards like 802.11ac and now we have received our first orders and now a very strong permanent thing for the future. Then as Peter was saying, we will work obviously at the next generation of platform that you will hear more about later. In closing, even though we have some difficult compares due to one issue, we are absolutely committed to this market and we will continue to be a leader in this market and we will continue to invest heavily to ensure that we provide leadership products in the communication market. Just to be clear, as you have lapped that one issue obviously, I know you are not giving guidance again, but we have one quarter left, so the street will be obviously putting targets out there for next year. Are you willing to quantify at all, what you think is a reasonable assumption for EMG in 2014? You are going to have to wait until the next quarter\\'s earnings call. As you know that\\'s when we currently give our guidance for 2014. Okay, that\\'s fair, and then if I can, just wanted to follow up on the Dako business. I don\\'t know if there is any kind of commentary for Roche and for Leica. It was kind of a weak business, well particularly in the U.S., but it seems like relative to where you would hoped that business would come in, it\\'s a little bit softer. So can you maybe talk about where you think the main drivers of that are and what you think can get that business growing at a rate that you needed to given the acquisition that you did? I am going to make a comment and turn it over to Lars but we are very excited where we are going. The markets slowing down, as you said. The good news is that means that we are really close to where the market is, lower number but we are highly competitive. As I said in my notes, we are going to be launching Autostainer which has been the biggest impediment to their growth but what I am also particularly excited about is the Agilent products that are being sold in the clinic and diagnostics. We are a small number, but still a very solid growth in the clinic with the Agilent products. I have just been very pleased with Lars\\' ability to put the two organizations together and really focus on what I think is going to be an exciting growth opportunity for the company. Lars, why don\\'t you give us some of the details of where you are and obviously comments about the growth rate that Didier noted for our next quarter. Yes. That\\'s a bit of an kind of exciting time we are in right now. Let me address the market perspectives that we see here. I think fundamentally the volume growth of the market are there in the vast majority of the geographies. Obviously, we have seen some guideline changes in the U.S. market that, in my book and also in the view of the industry, is going to be there temporarily and we will see that impact probably for another quarter or two until that flushes out and that becomes annualized but the overall volume growth in Europe as well as in APAC is very robust and very strong. So, I don\\'t think that there is any panic in terms of, will this market still continue to be an attractive market and will it be copied? In my book, it will be. Again, its going to take maybe a quarter or two. Now Dako performance, relative to the market, well it\\'s fair to say that we have improved our relative position maybe not to the extent that we had hoped at this point in time because obviously we want to drive growth and we are right now, I would say, holding the market growth. We probably growing at 2%, 3% with core Dako. It varies between the product lines and the overall market characterizes somewhere around 4% growth rate right now. So we are flattish with the market but we are right now in a real crossroads situation where we are switching between the old platform and now about to launch full speed new Dako Omnis that we are still controlling in feed sites. We have the fairly large amount of systems out there. The feedback from the customers is really stellar at this point in time and you might know, a very important note would be around the staining quality that we for Dako Omnis which is at the level or even better as in the prior platform. And this is a really, really strong feedback, because staining quality is something which counts and something that Dako has been well known for in the past. So I am very excited about what I am seeing here and talking about a couple of the growth drivers, Dako Omnis is a very powerful instrument. It\\'s geared at some larger accounts where Dako typically has had the smaller market share. So we do expect a pick up to come and it\\'s going to be an incremental pick up in terms of slight volume as well as larger accounts. So I am pretty pleased with what we are looking into right now in the initial forecast and roll up for the Dako basis in Q4. Again I am going to say, (inaudible) till the next quarter talking about \\'14; business is picking up and the team is getting really motivated and ready. I think in terms of quality index, Dako is probably going to [Indiscernible] one of the more powerful new product pipelines unleashed, now being unleashed, but also hitting the market in \\'14. So, in a sense, I think we have bottomed out and from here on I think you will see Dako pick up the pace and my expectation is that Dako is going to be above the market growth rate here in the couple of quarters. So we are making progress and the business is very healthy for us right now. Just a 30 second comment on the GSD part of it. Very pleased to see now how the momentum is building and gaining for the GSD business. We see our penetration and that\\'s our strategy into the clinical segment actually paving the way for the growth rates here. Looking at the core growth for GSD this quarter, which is around 8% and that compares very well and very favorable with the friends in the industry that we compare ourselves with every quarter. So pace is picking up. Momentum is picking up. Enthusiasm is picking up and profitability is picking up for the business. Stay tuned I think for more news around our GSD business going forward. Bill, I was hoping maybe you can start off by just highlighting maybe your top down view? How you feel maybe if you look back last quarter this time versus today? I know you are still highlighting a lot of challenging things going on but you are executing through that. Is it kind of fair to say there is no difference or are you seeing any pockets of improvement? Certainly some results have improved, certainly in U.S. and Europe, while China continued to tread. I am just wondering, overall, how you feel about the globe? Right now, in terms of our LDA business, as we had indicated both in our core growth rate and forecast for Q4, we are clearly gaining momentum on our LDA business. We had some great momentum, hit the slowdown, our growth rate was at or slightly below market and I think our momentum is going to go back to at or greater than market and again a lot of that, as Lars just described, moving forward and our chemical analysis and life science business, I believe, will have a momentum going forward. As I noted in my notes are progress in the BriC countries and the investment we have made continues to payoff. On the electronic measurement side, as the forecast, as until we get through the tough compares, I think it\\'s an industry that\\'s under a lot of pressure, both from the change in technologies to mobility, the change of who the winners are versus the losers, it is a highly competitive market. As a result of that it\\'s still a tough environment. If you take any sort of macroeconomic improvement sorting out exactly who the winner is going to be on the technology side, the Electronic Measurement of course comes roaring back, so I think that\\'s still a wait and see, LDA is clearly we are gaining momentum as we go into Q4. Okay. Great. Maybe just sticking with some of the prior questions on EMG, as we think about Q4, can you just remind us does that, I know you may be mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but maybe I missed it. Does the loss of that one customer is that impacting your Q4 guidance? I mean if you strip out that loss is there a better rate of growth that you will be achieving? And within communications particularly there has been a lot of rhetoric about this China mobile business. I am just kind of wondering how do you guys think about the build out of LTE in China if that possibly will have an impact on whether it be your fourth quarter or we have to look in the fiscal 2014 for that. Dan, this is Didier. I will take the first part of the question. Yes. Last year, our revenues with that account were about 25% in Q2, 50% Q3 and 25% in Q4. When I provided the guidance for Q4, that EMG would be down 11% on the core basis excluding that account, EMG would be down 6%. Yes. I may take at least the question on the China mobile discussion that this is obviously something that is very visible. You know that China mobile is in the middle of selecting their supplier, so you have opened a bit of. It is our understanding there is at least nine companies bidding for this and they will decide by end of August to early September who is going to be the winners of that. Obviously, we are very well positioned with all of them. We follow and track this business very closely, but then I still would like to make sure that everybody understands that the size of the opportunity is in my mind more in the $30 million plus or minus $10 million. Again when you think about August, China Mobile has planned to announce to spend about $6.7 billion on this deal. This is before bidding, so we don\\'t know what\\'s the real deal is going to be out of and only half of this volume is going to be really electronics so the rest is going to be buildings and a lot of other supplies and this means when you look at the test side especially with the capacity that is in already in the system and depending who is going to win the opportunity is what I said. So, we are tracking this very closely. On the other side, I think it will also provide us real gross vector for the overall 4G especially in China as we go into 2014 and 2015 and as China developed the 4G network going forward. Great. Thank you. Maybe one quick Didier, just on the buyback. You certainly utilized a fair amount of this quarter. Is there any possible signaling with that buyback maybe until rest of this quarter versus leaving a little in the fourth like in terms your view on the stock price where it was throughout the quarter versus your expectation going forward? Thanks a lot. We were opportunistic. Obviously, we did raise $600 million in debt. We had initially I mean we said we would count on more than $300 million that will come in November, but because we had that not available and we felt the time was right which was jumped in we still have the $300 million that comes in November as a tax effective cash repatriation similar to last year\\'s $550 million. Maybe one for Nick just on the pharma comments earlier. You talked about technology upgrades. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that some from the LC side versus mass spec? Maybe talk about any sheer dynamics there and are you actually getting traction for the new product launches yet or how do you think about there? Tycho. So, let me break that down for you. We are doing pretty well in LC. The new product launches they aren\\'t having much of an effect yet. We are getting orders but not revenue, pharma guys are doing well in terms of buying. We are at the end of their upgrade cycle in terms of replacement, but we are still seeing a technology buy up cycle, so there is a good secular growth and that has been strong in pharma. Mass spec for us has been a little bit softer in pharma. We see pharma still buying technology, but right now they are looking heavily at Triple Quad. There has been a lot of new product in the market and so there is a lot of valuation phase and so orders are kind of in the slower spot there. Okay. Then maybe Bill, your comments on EMG earlier, as we think about kind of the outlook there and I know you didn\\'t really want to talk about 2014 that much, but as we think about kind of the next 12 to 18 months for EMG. Is it fair to take kind of your fourth quarter number and use that as a starting point for a recovery or how do you think about the lumpiness of recovery for EMG ? Well. The issue that you have in EMG, if you look at historically is that there is a recovery in macro and continued investment in communication and the new product launches we are going to make us successful they tend to do incredibly well and so I think that\\'s what we have to see. Do we see continued strengthening in the world economy, EMG themselves come out with an next round of competitive products and we are able to capitalize on that and you can get a lot of movement of revenue correspondently. I always talk about this business. We always try to forecast and all we know it\\'s wrong going to be higher or lower. Again, if you look at their history, they historically have always kind of roaring back with some economic tailwinds and of course a great set of new products. Okay. Then the last one on environmental, you said it\\'s weak government spending. Any hope that business may turnaround kind of given the backdrop? Great question. So, let\\'s chase the source of the downturn we see in this. It really all is tied to weak government spending, primarily U.S. and in Europe and bit in Japan, so that really has impacted the business both, at the federal and state level for example in United States. I think the glimmer of hope in this segment and I still think there\\'s going to be for a while as the strength in emerging markets. As Bill mentioned early, across the board double-digit growth and we are seeing some increase volume in environmental side on a private sector related to fracking, where in the U.S. there a lot more samples running through our private contract customer labs as a result of the checking samples in the local environment. So, I think the story is all about the government spending in a lot of the key large geographies and your crystal ball in terms of what will happen in terms of their spend outlook is far better than mine. Thanks very much. We can stick with LSG just for a minute. Nick, I wanted to ask you about the operating margins which were strong in the quarter and you mentioned that the backlog you were able as I seem to recall you were able to extinguish it. The question really is can those operating margins continue through Q4. Then second if I may Bill or Didier on EMG if we take up a large customer concerned. Could we suggest that EMG business literally has troughed and that also reflects a trough margin of where we are today. Is that possible? Thank you very much. Our operating margins are work in progress and that\\'s the good news to your question. We saw some real mileage to go particularly in NMR, which has some weak margins in there, so I think we are making progress and I think it\\'s a work in progress. I am pretty optimistic on where those go, sequentially. Okay. Why don\\'t Guy make a comment at least in terms of the trough? Also have Ron talk about the progress we are making at manufacturing. Again, yes, we talk about the macro environments, but we are attempting control what we should control and that is our manufacturing efficiency and obviously our expense structure. Well, I would say it is a perhaps the order rates growth of EMG over the quarter. You could say that order rates is picking up and we have had the bottom is behind us. Now, obviously, it\\'s all about Q4 and how this is going to shape up the new products as Bill was mentioning. Our manufacturing consolidation programs continue to be on track and we are doing a real effective job of taking millions of dollars out of this system. We saw over $50 million worth of cost reductions last year. Roughly that same amount this year, then more coming after that, so we are very, very pleased with the manufacturing consolidation and we look forward to delivering more to the bottom-line. Bill, I appreciate your enthusiasm on EMG but is the absolute level of EMG bookings not concerning here? I mean I am not speaking about comps or one customer but just the fact that ENG\\'s run rate is some 15% trough levels back in FY09, it just doesn\\'t feel like nearly that bad as a macro backdrop. Can you offer some context into that I guess from my perspective again, what Guy said, the group in itself, regardless of the one customer opportunity, it continues to go the transformation. We continue to invest in communications in a very tough competitive environment. We continue to make investments in module instrumentation that we must win in module instrumentation. It is going to be a multi-year effort. We have another quarter of very, very solid double-digit growth moving forward. So EMG, in a sense, is how do I protect the bottom-line for Agilent? How do I ensure that I take the best communication business that I can? And then how do I invest in the future? Again, always the question is, as we go to modular business, how much of that is substitution versus winning the broader market and getting do you have a comment, but we are making the investment in EMG to ensure that they have the portfolio of products and the only one that has portfolio of products to have low cost transducers just enough test to having these very feature rich instruments that we have been noted for, for the last 75 years. So again we got a lot of moving parts inside of EMG, but from my perspective, I have watched the business for many, many decades, I am absolutely positive that we are focusing on the right things. Didier? I will just add that for all product categories that we have in our portfolio, we have a very strong leading position and I am glad to see that again we keep taking share, in oscilloscopes, for instance as we go forward and the modular program as Bill was mentioning, is going extremely fast and on new applications that really we are into it. So ongoing focus on the core markets where we see growth going forward makes a difference and we will make a difference. The last comment I would have, and again this goes back, and not to be an excuse, is we have always had a very strong position in manufacturing. We have always had a strong position in computers and semiconductor. As you know, the computer and semiconductor market are not great. So we have had some bad breaks on the mix and again we choose that business. So again I am making an excuse but nonetheless I can\\'t state strongly enough that we are making the right investment and we are focusing on the right products for the long haul. Thanks, and then just one follow-up for Nick. Can you speak to any Japan stimulus impact that you may have experienced? Is that more of an order phenomena or was there any contribution in terms of revenue in the period? Yes, Brandon, right now it is order noise, primarily. There is probably a little bit of revenue leakage but we are pretty optimistic in what our base is doing there and trying to drive enthusiasm and we are seeing some monies come out of the private sector just because of the enthusiasm of growth. Obviously it\\'s not government money but right now the stimulus in Japan is more noise and order optimism than it is revenue. I guess, for Bill or Didier. I wanted to drill down on wireless manufacturing, post some of the share shift over the last year. Can you help us understand the revenue contribution that wireless manufacturing is currently within, either communications or EMG ? Then I think earlier you replied to a question that you expect to be a leader in the communication segment but if we dig specifically in the communications and focus on wireless manufacturing, given the entry of two very disruptive competitors, would you expect wireless manufacturing to be a driver of growth over the next few years. Well, let me start with the second question then on the first. The wireless manufacturing business, as we said, has always been very lumpy and depends on a few set of players. We are a player in this environment. We have a platform that is currently winning and now, as we mentioned earlier, we are working on a new generation of platforms that will allow us to compete even stronger in this marketplace. So clearly we keep focusing there. The core element are still an interest of our future going product line is in the R&D sector. We have an extremely strong set of portfolios from software simulations that goes into R&D up to design validation and conformance testing. We will keep timing of upgrading and updating and adding more solutions into this portfolio to really keep playing our role in wireless full ecosystem from R&D to manufacturing. Perfect, and then I guess Bill, you discussed strength in modular instrumentation in the quarter and you stated that you have to win in modular instrumentation. Can you help us understand just so we can get a sense of what level this strength is coming out of? What is the revenue contribution of modular instrumentation currently taking EMG segment? I guess my perception is that it\\'s very low single-digit percentage contribution. Is that a fair approximation? Well I think we mentioned it in the last earnings call. I mean it\\'s still a small percent but last year it threw $100 million, not counting the software part of it and we mentioned that in the Analyst Day. We continue to grow double-digits and we are spending $70 million a year to win. So we are absolutely committed and Ron has mentioned this many times, we have been in the module business for years but if you put our software efforts together with our module instrumentation, my guess is Ron is getting faster close to 10% of the overall EMG. We are making real progress. Perfect, and perhaps I guess for Bill or Didier, I maybe reading too much into this but your fourth quarter revenue and earnings guidance range appeared a little bit narrower than the range you provided in past quarters. I assume you interpret for us to mean perhaps you are little bit more comfortable of the stability of the business or conversely could this mean that the tightening of your delivery policy has led to fewer vacillations and deliveries towards the end of the quarter that\\'s given you a little bit more comfort. No, I understand that but we are comfortable with the guidance that we have given, given the backlog and expected ship of board. Maybe a question for Lars. Lars, I am trying to reconcile over this very positive commentary on Dako with some of the proposed reimbursement cuts here in the U.S. in segments it looks like it might effect to you, like station, special scanning and what have you. Could you address how you are thinking about potential cuts with your mix of the business and the opportunity going forward? Yes, well I see that. Obviously, we are very well aware about guideline changes and potentially reimbursement changes that might be impact our businesses overall. I think if I step back, it will get, our overall position in the U.S. market in terms of kind of (inaudible) industry and the FISH business. We are starting from a fairly low position. So, if I were sitting on a market share with just 65%, 70% for FISH or ISH or IC, I will probably have couple of sleepless nights but then we start literally from a low single digit market share position in the FISH business and a relatively low on IC, I still feel this is incremental upside for us going forward, given the fact that we are now going to penetrate this segment. So, it depends on who you talk to here. If you talk to some of our competitors, I think they have a considerable different exposure then the Dako organization has. Got it, that\\'s helpful, thank you. Then my follow-up question for whoever wants to take it. We are nearly six months now since you shined a brighter light on your efforts to improve NMR. I am wondering if you could offer more color on the progress in those efforts? Thanks for the question, Dan. We continue to slog through NMR. If you recall, the challenge here is really to reformat the business. We have done quite a bit of that then to reframe the manufacturing, that process is pretty much complete. Then to launch new technologies and we are in that cycle now, so we have got technologies flowing out now that utilize our electronics capabilities in the core platform. We continue to evolve and we are going to disseminate that further and further across the product line and we have also refocused the business away from the academic sector and more heavily towards the industrial sector and that\\'s just a reflection of macroeconomic, so work in progress and we continue to slog through. It\\'s not a pretty picture, but we are on track to what we showed you when we were in New York. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. First one was on China. You guys didn\\'t touch on it a bit in your prepared comments, but I was wondering if you would give us a sense of the bigger in terms of how orders trended throughout the quarter and then maybe put that in context with what we saw in China regarding credit conditions and just general capital spending. Clearly long-term secular growth opportunity, but still little choppy in China for the back half of this calendar year, so any color there would be helpful. Thank you. In terms of China, I mean, the story for China for us is LDA. Mike, why don\\'t you talk a little bit about I mean, a lot of it was on the applied side and so course if Nick has any comments moving forward. On electronic side, of course is dominated by depending on who the big players are that we want and what not, but really the story in China is on the LDA side, so Mike why don\\'t you give some color on your China business last quarter? Sure, Bill. I think this is more than just a quarter story, in fact you may recall some of our previous conversation in prior analyst call where we talked about there been a positive business latter of part of last year with the reformation of the new government and their emphasis on improving the quality of life and China dream that we are very bullish on the prospects for our business in China. In fact, we are now seeing that come into real orders into the business and I think that consistent with that philosophy in terms of the focus on improving the quality of life we are seeing continue to see very significant investments in the food segment as well as environmental testing segment, but also a strong growth in chemical energy as they continue to build out their industrial infrastructure, so we can point to other segments in the applied side being up in China and I think indicative of long-term secular trends that you referred to earlier question. Another question comes up about the impact on possible credit tightening. We have not yet seen that in our business. This is Nick. Same comments as Mike, the pharma industry pretty strong building out infrastructure. We are pretty insulated. If you look at the macro credit challenges, that\\'s in the housing industry, it\\'s in the consumer products and it\\'s in the factory infrastructure. Pharma factories are getting built up by multinationals as well as government, so that hasn\\'t being impacted. So, we are very bullish on what\\'s going on in China. Got it. Then just maybe for either Nick or Lars, question on diagnostics. If I put your comments on Dako and then your other genomics tool sort of in context here, can you give us a sense of how much work you think you need to do to build up the franchise going forward? You obviously have a lot of stuff in the pipeline already organically, but just to sort of get that business in critical mass relative to the competition and relative to your other divisions, can you give us a sense of how much work do you think you have to do there? Yes. Let me take that one. It\\'s a good question. Actually I came out of the breakout meeting my team yesterday where you addressed that situation. It\\'s a [great] to be part of Agilent, but all of you can see that we are a small part of Agilent. I think we have the prospects for us, because the market opportunity is certainly there. Obviously, the organic growth play that you see can be either high single-digit up to maybe mid-single-digit, depends on how look at the business. How aggressive you fund it and so forth. This is going to be a transformation of industry and our book and we believe that we have to think big to participate here, because it will continue to consolidate then the fewer is going to get bigger and it\\'s a choice that we make on how we are going to think about that business. Obviously, organic growth rate is going to get us a bit, but in my book we had to look big here and see the opportunities that are ahead. Obviously no commitment on time or any significance of that, but there\\'s a great number of opportunities that we are looking at right now. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe talk a bit about how the organization responded to some of the cost measure you did. Obviously, it\\'s always tough to adjust workforce et cetera, and so it looks like on the OpEx line and even on the gross margin line, you guys did a really nice job on execution, so maybe just give some comments in and out on how do you feel like the organization responded? I will give my perspective, because I didn\\'t have to do the work and then I will turn it over to Ron. He did, did the work with the team. Our organization response to task, adversity, reaction to market conditions incredibly well. We know how to do this, we have a very robust management system to ensure that we can execute on a strategy even if it\\'s a tactical one in terms of reducing cost. As Didier alluded to, we are right on track and the team has executed and we have done it in such a way that the employees impacted were treated fairly respectfully. Again, we continue to ensure that they can hopefully do everything we can that they can land on their feet. But, from my view point, I think the execution has been excellent. Ron? We have a very smart, well educated work force and they understand how their job is to provide shareholder value. So, as we have seen this economic situation, they understood what we were doing and we have seen great support. All of the functions that we are involved managed to go through this and it\\'s going very smooth. It\\'s very difficult to see some of the reductions, but on the other hand everybody get it and I am very pleased with the progress. Good afternoon. Really just I think three quick clean up questions. First, Didier, could you provide assumptions for fiscal Q4 operating margin by segment, at least what you have incorporated into guidance? Second, I guess for either Guy or Didier. I just want to confirm that there is no tail to the large, I guess, $230 million order loss beyond fiscal Q4. This was obviously a multi-quarter headwind for EMG this year and I just want to confirm that. This was attributable to only one account loss and that this is essentially a discrete one-time dynamic that will be behind you after this quarter. Then third, Nick, earlier you spoke about the book-to-bill in LSG coming up a bit light of your expectations, yet it just seems like that you guided LSG revenue growth in Q4 to levels that are least in line if not maybe above Street expectation, so I was just curious if you would talk about whether not you saw some strength in ordering patterns maybe early in the quarter? Thank you. Hi, Doug, I will take the first question regarding operating margin in line with the guidance for Q4 for EMG and LDA. It\\'s about the same, both of them slightly North of 19% for the both EMG and LDA. Obviously slightly above 19% for Agilent, overall at mid-point. The question on tail of the order, we got some orders in Q1 that we shipped in shipped in Q2, so there\\'s is going to be tail, but far smaller than what we had as compared so far Then Doug to your question, we did have a rising trend of orders across the quarter, so that\\'s the first part of your question. Then in Q4, we have got a little bit of an easy compare as well, so that\\'s why you see the kind of guidance we get so we think we are pretty sound there. Hi. This is actually (Inaudible) for Amit today. Nick, I had one to start for you. In the pharma business, can you make any comments on what you saw in the early stage discovery business there? Not sure I understand the question. You mean in terms of what they are ordering or what the pattern is? Yes, I mean just how did they fare during the quarter? What did you see coming from that side of the business? Yes, so what we are seeing in early stage discovery, that\\'s where we see most of the technology stuff. So most of the technology upgrade because what they are doing in early stages discovery across the whole therapeutic sector is biologic. So that\\'s a big driver from mass spec and it\\'s a big driver for our biologically compatible LC, not to mention our general UHPLC product. So that has been a pretty strong sector. That was probably the leading piece of the pharma portfolio. Okay, and then just overall on Europe, was there anything there that set out? I know it was weak in the quarter but any end markets in particular that were stronger than expected Certainly, within LDA, as I mentioned Europe grew on a core growth basis whereas EMG was down. So that gives you an indication of what markets are and which ones are down. Okay, and then were there any overall trends in the quarter on the revenue side as far as pacing goes in July and maybe early into August? Given that we still have a very high percentage of capital equipment, our revenue always tends to be back-end loaded in the quarter and that\\'s why we continue to report orders because they really are good indication of future business. But we typically ship more in the last month of the quarter than the first. Then of course once we started doing that it lasts for decades. Bill, I wanted to ask a question about the overall business mix from the high level from the standpoint of cyclicality versus non-cyclicality. Notwithstanding the work you have done over the past few years to try to reduce the cyclicality of the business, it is still fairly cyclical. So would you anticipate wanting to make any changes, whether it be additions to the portfolio or subtractions from the portfolio to change that going forward or are you happy where it is at this point. The strategy that we embarked on in 2005 after we spun off our semiconductor business has proved very effective. We will soon have a $4 billion LDA business, not to give a forecast for next year but we are very, very close to that, and the investment we made both organically and inorganically has been exactly what we wanted to do, bring our engineering expertise to be able to expand from our engineering, chemical engineering foundation, the life science and diagnostics moving forward that would be a continued investment that we have. The volatility we have, of course, is in electronic measurement. They have done a superb job of managing the operating margins through what is just inherently a very volatile business. So I believe that we have executed on our strategy and we will continue to focus on growing our LDA business and continue to be a leader in electronic measurement with what is really the highest profits in the industry. Okay, thanks, and a real quick one for Lars. On the cytogenetics market, you talked about some strength in the array business there. Do you anticipate that that might cannibalize some of the opportunities in the FISH market? I know that was part of the thesis for the Dako acquisition. I am just wondered how this idea of growth in the cytogenetics arrays kind of plays into that outlook? Well, no. I don\\'t think that there is going to be a large degree of cannibalization, honestly. I think the CDH or arrays plays its role. The FISH is going to be there for preliminary [ph] testing and so far there is still a lot of room for growth for a company like Agilent in the FISH business there nor through an intense competitor. I think it\\'s fair to say that we are making good progress as an organizational developing kind of universal type of probe that\\'s going to fit both, say, around the cyto space as well as the pathology business. So I don\\'t think that that is a trend at all. It\\'s just a great opportunity for a company like Agilent. I just wanted to ask a little questions about the academic and government. You have about 7% of the revenues in the quarter from academic and government and that\\'s not the aerospace and defense portion of it. Yet you said you were down about 7% in that market. I am just curious what was that excluding currencies? The reason why I am asking is that you have, relative to you peers, a lot less exposure to some of the academic markets out there. I am just curious as why your business maybe a little bit weaker than maybe some of your peers are reporting? Is there something going on that I am missing. Derek I will answer the question obviously from life sciences perspective. I don\\'t think there is anything missing. We have a big CapEx in the academic and government. So as we are getting towards the end of fiscal year for the U.S., that\\'s where the big stall and the sequestration is coming. Our exposure is certainly less in aggregate than others but I am not sure that our response was significantly different, if you cut just to the CapEx piece. I think that\\'s just the report. Many of our competitors have lots of consumables, lots through reagents. They are down but they all never be as down typically as much as we do given the bias towards capital investment. Well. I was just sort of more comparing to like Waters, for example. I mean their number is were a little bit there. But I will take it is more CapEx and more in that sense. On the diagnostic and genomics business, the gross margin in that business has been down year-over-year on all three quarters despite the fact the organic revenue growth has been a lot better than expected in that segment, at least to my model. I guess is that due to product launches, FX? Could you just talk a little bit more about what\\'s going on. Then I guess ultimately where does the gross margin in that business sort of go to? I will Lars talk about it. We obviously make an huge investments in the business and the mix but as I said very clearly there is full expectations that Lars\\' business will get to the 20% operating model of the company or higher, moving forward. But Lars, why don\\'t you talk a little bit about the short term investments and what\\'s going on. Yes, I will still kind of address the root cause to the question. What you have to realize is when Dako comes in basically through a new kind of accounting standard, there is a reclassification from what is the expense lines to the COGS line and COGS line to the expense line and so forth. So there is a one-off distorts that pick to some extent in combination with the genomic basically that\\'s kind of an ongoing operation and it has been there for years. So that\\'s kind of the one-ff phenomenon that\\'s being washed out and fixed out right now. I think what you will see now is fundamentally a quarter or two where we have been sort of weak in terms of a product mix which has been unfavorable. It\\'s been skewed towards a bit more instrumentation than consumables. As you know, we are sourcing our instrumentation literally from OEM providers out there and pay a margin on getting the boxes done for us and so forth. So, as we get more of the Dako on the solution boxes out there, it will drive much more reagents on top of it, we feel that our gross margins are going to creep up north. We don\\'t see a tremendous amount of cost pressure or price pressure in our accounts and our business right now. It\\'s a bit here and there but basically this is still a well behaving industry, the (inaudible) trends comparison and so forth. So I see that gross margins are going to stabilize and even increase with the onset of more FISH business coming on stream for us, which is typically a higher business. So to Bill\\'s point, what he has alluded to, the operating margin today for a group which is 15%, which is a little bit higher on genomics, a little on Dako, I expect it\\'s going to climb pretty high here. We would be onset to more volume of all consumables. So I think it\\'s a long answer, but that\\'s the facts that I see here. Okay. This is Didier. I was going to update, the gross margin for DGG really has stayed fairly constant at 60%. It was 60.8% last year in Q3 and Q3, 59.4% so plus 1% point reduction and Lars really explained why the mix played that and basically it withdrew about 1% from the margins, but it\\'s about the same thing of the opening profits, plus 16.2% last year, 14.6% this year. So again a lot of the mix issues that have been raised by Lars. And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\\'s conference. I would now like to turn the call over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Well, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today and certainly if you have any calls, please feel free to call myself or Elena, and have a good day. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\\'s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.

Thank you for joining us on today’s call. Our new Agilent team had a strong year. Let me start by highlighting our fourth quarter performance, focusing on three key numbers.  First, revenue is up 6.2% on a core basis. Second, adjusted operating margin is up 150 basis points to 21.9%. Finally, EPS of $0.50 is above the high end of our guidance. Now I would like to talk about our full-year results. For the full-year, our core revenue is up 6.4%. It is worth noting that this is our highest annual core growth rate since 2011. Adjusted operating margin is up 80 basis points to 19.6% and EPS of $1.74 is above the midpoint of both our November 2014 and August 2015 guidance.  We offset significant FX headwinds and $40 million of dis-synergies from the spin-off of our electronic measurement business. Our fourth quarter capped off a stellar performance by the team in our first year of the New Agilent. This team has not skipped a beat as we’ve navigated through a CEO transition, implemented a new strategy and dealt with changing market conditions. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our commitment to drive both growth and operating margin expansion.  Now let me move on to more details on what is going on within the business. Our Q4 results are driven by strength in the pharma, diagnostics, clinical and food markets. Geographically, we saw core growth across all regions, with particular strength in our liquid chromatography offerings, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics products. Let me highlight the Q4 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. Strong performance in Pharma was offset by softness in the industrial and academia & government markets. LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 20%, down 20 basis points from a year ago.  In November, Agilent closed its acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Seahorse is a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics. Seahorse’s unique technology is the perfect complement to Agilent’s market-leading separations and mass spec solutions, in particular for metabolomics and disease research in pharma. The combination of these two platforms gives scientists a more comprehensive and faster path to researching some of the most challenging diseases affecting mankind. Seahorse will be incorporated into Agilent’s financials starting in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. In Q4, Agilent started shipping the new 1290 Infinity II Vialsampler, as well as the 600-bar 1260 Infinity version. At the BCEIA Conference in Beijing, we introduced the Agilent 5977B High-Efficiency Source GC/MSD System, a tandem gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer that delivers lower levels of detection than any other instrument in its class.  We also introduced the 4200 TapeStation system. This fully automated instrument enables scientists to rapidly analyze up to 96 DNA samples at a time, and sets a new sample QC standard for next-gen sequencing; and we also launched several targeted solutions, such as our GC QTOF Pesticide Analysis Solution, and our LC QTOF Water Analysis System. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group delivered another strong quarter, with core revenue growth of 11% in Q4. Both services and consumables experienced strong growth across all geographies. Operating margin was 25.1% for the quarter, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Customers are benefitting from ACG’s new brand promise to deliver insights that lead to outcomes. In Q4, Agilent University introduced an enhanced portfolio of online training courses. This enables customers from lab technicians to researchers, to develop new skills and gain insights that can improve economic, operational and scientific outcomes for their laboratories. The launch of the online training has exceeded our expectations.  In consumables, we introduced a new product to help food-safety labs test high-fat samples more accurately. The Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid removes matrix interferences that have made test results challenging to reproduce. This gives food-safety labs a better way to address what has been one of their most challenging tasks.  Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to build momentum in Q4, delivering 10% core revenue growth and strength across all of its businesses. Target enrichment was particularly strong, while Dako Omnis once again had record shipments and it continues to gain competitive wins.  DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 19.2%, up 430 basis points from a year ago. In the fourth quarter, two new diagnostics products from DGG received FDA approval. The first product was created in partnership with Merck & Co. This new companion diagnostic test can reveal whether a patient with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is likely to respond to Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA.  The second product is our first complementary diagnostic developed in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. This new test can identify PD-L1 expression levels on the surface of non-small-cell lung cancer tumor cells, and provide information on the survival benefit with OPDIVO for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. Now, let’s take a brief look at Agilent’s revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continue to see ongoing strength in the pharma, diagnostics and clinical markets, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptick and healthy demand across the spectrum.  Applied end-market performance was led by continued growth in food and environmental and chemical & energy were flat on a core basis. As we noted in our Q3 call, customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in light of weakening commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economy. Geographically, we saw core revenue growth across all regions led by the U.S. and Asia, excluding Japan.  Now let me provide some additional insight on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program launched in Q2 is re-engineering the company to be more nimble and efficient. In fiscal 2015 our actions delivered about $40 million in gross savings. In addition, the NMR closed resulted in $15 million in savings, and our Agilent Order fulfillment organization delivered on its $25 million committed savings.  We remain on track to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY17, a 4 point improvement over FY14, exclusive of company split dis-synergies. At the same time we continue to invest in long-term revenue growth. Our results over the past three quarters give us confidence in our ability to deliver on this longer-term operating margin expansion commitment. We are pleased with the operational results for our first year as the New Agilent Technologies, and our ability to meet our external earnings commitments for the full year.  Now I want to tell you about how we think about our guidance. We are committed to achieving our long-term financial goals. At the same time, we will be more conservative in our guidance. This is especially prudent due to macro-market concerns that have developed since I spoke with many of you at our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting. Before turning the call over to Didier, I want to recap a few highlights of our first year as the New Agilent Technologies. This was a transformational year for the company. We successfully completed the CEO transition. We formed a new executive leadership team that is deeply committed to delivering results. We have also implemented a new company strategy, restructured the company’s operations and product portfolio, and committed to new long-term financial goals. Despite all this change and moving pieces, we have delivered growth and increasing profitability over the past three quarters.  Let me close with a few comments about the future. We are making acquisitions such as Cartagenia and Seahorse, expanding our presence in served life sciences and diagnostics markets. Our pipeline of new offerings has never been stronger. I am convinced we have an energized, aligned team at Agilent that will deliver on our full potential. I remain quite confident in our long-term prospects of above-market growth, increasing profitability levels, and greater shareholder value. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our FY16 guidance. Didier. Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year performance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.2% and 6.4% respectively, and our operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight was 21.9% and 19.6% respectively.  Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Keysight spinoff, our operating margin was up 240 basis points in Q4 and up 170 basis points for the full year. We are therefore well on our way to deliver on the committed 400 basis points improvement in adjusted operating margin by fiscal year ‘17. Our hedging strategy, consisting of both structural and systematic financial hedges was put to the test this year and delivered very well. Thanks to structural hedging stemming from our global footprint, flow-through was just 20% and we also gained $18 million from our systematic cash flow hedges.  Turning to capital returns and cash flow for the year, we returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks and generated $491 million in operating cash flow. We did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter, but we intend to repurchase this quarter, subject to customary conditions. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year ‘16 revenue guidance of $4.15 billion to $4.17 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0% to 4.5%. It is based on October 30 exchange rates and takes into account the Cartagenia and Seahorse acquisitions, as well as the XRD divestiture and NMR exit. We expect currency will have a 1.7% negative impact on revenues.  Regarding XRD and NMR, fiscal year ‘15 revenues were $58 million and fiscal year ‘16 revenues are expected to be $12 million. We project fiscal year ‘16 EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.91, growing 6% to 10 %, based on an adjusted operating margin of 20.0% to 20.5%. You will notice that we are projecting a narrow revenue and EPS range at this time. We believe that 4.3% core revenue growth and 20.3% adjusted operating margin are the proper midpoints, taking into account both the present macroeconomic environment and our operating margin commitments. With those midpoints, we want to set the low end of our guidance in line with our commitments. Having set those at 4.0% core revenue growth and 20% adjusted operating margin, the high-end of the guidance naturally falls out at 4.5% core revenue growth and 20.5% adjusted operating margin. As you adjust your models for fiscal year ‘16, please consider the following nine points; first, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2015. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $57 million and as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $22 million. Depreciation is projected to be – that is the third point, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth point, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Fifth, we plan to return approximately $635 million in capital to shareholders, including $155 million in dividends and $480 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Six, as communicated at the Analyst and Investor Day in May, we plan to borrow $250 million around February to fund a portion of our buyback program. Seven, net interest expense is forecasted at $68 million, and other income at $7 million, including $12 million billed to Keysight. Eight, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 328 million shares, 7 million less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year ’15. And ninth and last, we expect operating cash flow of $650 million and capital expenditures of $140 million, $42 million over fiscal year ‘15 as we embark on a two-year program to significantly increase the capacity of our nucleic acid facilities.  Now, finally moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1 billion to $1.02 billion and EPS of $0.42 to $0.44. At midpoint, revenue will grow 3.5% year-over-year on a core basis, and EPS will grow 5%. As customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.  Good afternoon, thanks very much. I think you guys mentioned in the script a couple of times the fact that you are taking a more conservative approach to guidance this year. So Mike, wondering if could just put a little more color around how your process around guidance has changed this year. Just want to get a better appreciation for what you guys are doing different when it comes to planning for guidance? Yes, thanks Isaac. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on our philosophy around the thinking behind the guidance. As you know I mentioned earlier, this is the first year the New Agilent Technologies. It is also my first year in the CEO seat and I had a chance to reflect on how we have guided the company over the last year.  And what I decided to do was really take a, if you will a more prudent and conservative outlook to our guidance and a couple of factors were in my thinking. One is, first the world has really changed since May when we spoke to the group about the longer term outlook for the company’s growth and the macro outlook has come a lot more challenging since then.  We’ve seen IMF grow on the GDP and some of our larger chemical customers who have taken down their outlook for ’16 and I thought just bringing down the guidance of bid in terms of the top-line mid-point or half point or so was a prudent way to plan for the company. We’ll take a look at the business as it develops over the quarter or two, but really wanted to take a more prudent and conservative outlook into 2016.  I will also remind you that we are not altering our commitments to achieving our 22% operating margin by 2017 and then the number of the conversations over the last several months, we’ve indicated that we can make those margin improvements even at a 4% top line revenue growth scenario. And then maybe just one final note here, as a reminder when we provide guidance, our internal plans are always higher and that’s our executives are compensated within the company.  Okay, thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on a couple of details. One would be, can you disclose a growth rate in China this quarter and secondly, in DDG it looks like gross margin was down a little bit sequentially on a higher based of revenue than you had in fiscal 3Q, so I’m just wondering what\\'s going on in that business. Thank you. Sure, how about if I go ahead and make some commentary on China, then Jacob if you can chime in on the DDG specific questions. So, the results came in China just as we expected. We exited the year in mid-single digit growth rate for the year. Finished the year very strongly in China and we do this as a source of growth for the company. I think you may really, we I think are one of the first to call an early return to growth about this time last year.  For me whether it goes to mid to high single digit range, it will really be depended on what happens in the chemical and energy space. That really is the wildcard I think for our overall growth rate in China next year. But the business developed as forecasted and we are quite pleased with how we ended the year. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Jacob on the DGG question.  Yes, hi Isaac. Yes, you’re right that our gross margin came down a little bit and it’s really due to the mix that we in Q3 had higher number of ratings and we had a little bit higher number of instruments in Q4. But that’s just the variability between the quarters and nothing you can say fundamentally has changed.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Good afternoon guys. So I guess, as you think about sort of the key delta you started – stick on the guidance topic, but the key dealt sort of today versus the Analyst Day or even versus where you were maybe a month or two ago, where would you sort of point out the significant assumption changes were? Weather it was top line and then can you just flow that through, because it does look like still even though you are delivering on the multiyear cost, the next year operating margin targets are a bit lower.  And then if you have any sense of where the delta is versus the street, because in our math based on the consensus it looks like there was a bit higher of other income assumption. So we are just trying to figure out if that was one of the deltas again versus maybe what the market was looking for? Yes, thanks Ross. I appreciate the question. So relative to how your thinking has evolved since the May, I think I would point to two things; one is the chemical and energy space. This is the fourth quarter in a row for us in terms of flat growth and now it’s still a robudence [ph] in our environmental business because we are really not getting the same volume and that was associated with the fracking in the U.S. That’s the one where we’ve kind of pushed out the timing in terms of the return of growth. The business is holding steady, but is not yet to a growth trajectory.  So I think point one would be kind of a longer timeline in terms of the return to growth in the chemical and energy sector and then the other one is the impact, what we are seeing in some of the emerging economics, Brazil, Russia continue to be quite weak for us, albeit we have good strength in India and as I mentioned earlier China. And I think third was just an outlook of being a little bit more conservative and prudent on our overall guidance assumptions. And Didier, I think Ross’s math is correct on other income, but would you like to add some comments on that.  Yes Ross, we are looking at the – we also analyzed the delta versus the consensus and it seems to come from a little bit from the revenue side, probably not taking into account the reduction due to RPD, so a little bit on that. A little bit on the operating margin percentage and a quite significant number surprisingly on other income and expense.  And I must say, you are the only one who nailed that number exactly, precisely and we’ve seen that in other cases quite significant differences in other income and expense. And I remind everybody that especially net interest expense this year we incurred $59 million. We say that we are going to borrow $250 million. We have modeled to borrow it at the middle of February and therefore we’ll add about $9 million of interest expense. So basically I think those were the main factors. All right, great. And I guess maybe secondarily, so I feel it’s unusual you guys didn’t buy any stock in the quarter. Can you give us a sort of sense? It seems like the assumption is that will obviously occur in ’16. Give us a sense for why that was? Was it Seahorse, was it something else, and then it looked like free cash came in a little bit below or a reasonable amount below what you were looking for. Can you just walk us through sort of where that delta was versus kind of what you laid out? Hey Ross, this is Mike. Well I’ll go ahead and handle the first part of the question and then I’ll bounce it back to you Didier for the second part of the Ross’s question. So hey Ross, I do really appreciate the question, but we are not really in a position to comment on the circumstances around the stock repurchases in to Q4. But I would remind you is that are going to resume repurchase this quarter and as Didier mentioned in his remarks, I believe we are targeting $480 million of repurchases in 2016. And Didier can you address the second quarter.  Yes, on the cash flow basis your correct. When we started the year, we talked about $600 million of operating cash flow and now we are at $500 million. But already at the Analyst Day we had adjusted that number, although we provided a number excluding one-time items, but it was if I recall $555 million and since then I mean we’ve been exactly in line with the commitment. So the number is about $500 million. The reason why it’s down from the initial estimate is mostly related to currency, mostly that’s what it is. And again, we are in line with our commitment since the analysis day.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of, John Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. Great, thanks. Mike, on the outlook again, I know you are no longer commenting explicitly on orders and backlog like you were previously. But as you go into next year, was there anything from an orders standpoint that gives you a little bit more caution in ‘16 or is it just the dynamics you just read previously, wanted to be a little bit more conservative? Thank you John and I do really appreciate the question, but as we mentioned previously, we are no longer reporting on coming in orders. But I would say that the guidance reflects of you, of conservatism, not any concerns on the order front. Okay, and then last one for me, if you look at the Life Science & Applied Markets Group, I think the operating margin there was down 20 basis points. Can you maybe just dig into a little bit more detail about that business? Sure, thanks Mike. Regarding the operating margin you have to realize that we first and foremost had all sort of dis-synergies of this plate, which brought us down about a 1% compared to last year. And then if we look at the product mix that we have this quarter, it was a little bit different that the quarters before in terms of we had less cheesy, given the exposure we had in the oil industry, in the chemical and energy market and a little bit while other pieces in spectroscopy came up. So product mix had also a minor impact, but the biggest one you have seen is probably through there, because of the dis-synergies.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.  Yes, thanks for the question there. First one for me is on the academic and government in the market. I guess you talked about a spending pause in the U.S. Can you give us a little more color there? I guess when did that happen and what do you see in other geographies in terms of academic and government?  Sure, thanks, happy to take it. So as Mike alluded to first, it was tough compared to last year. This is one of the major reasons why it has been flat or slightly negative this quarter. And we had also lower spending in the US, it was softer than we had expected especially in September. For a very specific month we have seen smaller deals and our customers are a little bit more cautious given the budget uncertainties they have seen in some areas. So looking forward we actually [Audio Gap]. Got it. And how about other geographies like Japan. I guess what do you see in the academic and government funding their?  Well, on a worldwide base I would say is what we have seen is that it was more solid in Europe and in China and Japan it was also flat for the last quarter. So the biggest impact we have seen was definitely in the U.S.  Okay, and then one more from me. On the forensics side, you referenced timing of some larger deals I guess. What happened there and can you quantify how big the impact was? Yes, well the growth for forensic was in the low single digit for the quarter, yes. Which one do you mean it now? Yes, just earlier in the prepared remarks I guess in the deck you talked about forensic being muted by the timing of the larger deals. Yes, I’m just kind of curious on what happened in terms of the timing and how big those larger deals were. What was the impact? You mean, okay for the deals in the US. Again, last year given we had these double digit growth, it was based on several large deals we had. Those large deals, we haven’t seen the same magnitude this year, this is what I wanted to say. So they were smaller compared to last year. This is also brought the overall growth down in the U.S. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. I think I’ll stick with the guidance if you wouldn’t mind. Could you maybe breakdown expectations for the three main segments next year? I mean effectively in our models right now we’re essentially having the organic growth rate that you guys reported in 2015. So if you could kind of help us source maybe where we should modify some expectations, I think that would be pretty helpful. Sure Dane, I’ll be happy to. So as we looked at the growth assumptions by end markets, I think the biggest one I think will be chemical energy, which is as you know 25% of the company and we’re assuming flat for the entire year.  The applied markets low single digit growth, higher for food, but really no growth in the environmental side of that segment and then as Patrick mentioned earlier, government and academia in the low single digits, pharma high single digits and the diagnosis and the clinical markets are also high single digits. So you can see there’s quite a mix between the pharma and diagnostics market of differential versus the chemical energy space. So if we flow that through the model, I think where we might have a little trouble is looking at 2016. So we give about – take everything together about 3% top-line growth to get to that $4.16 billion. To get to the operating profit line of about 20 spot to five or spot two if you wanted the brand, that’s about a 60% plus variable margin, which seems a bit high given you can kind of go back in history, and I think even in kind of coming out of a trough year in 2010 it was still about 55%. And then when we flow that through to 2017 to kind of hit the targets, you are talking about another 60% variable margin.  Can you kind of help us in line with where you guys laid out your analyst day and reiterated in the presentation here, how to get to that 22% operating margin in 2017, because it’s I guess looking pretty aggressive at the moment. Yes, I mean there’s a lot of moving parts, but nothing has fundamentally changed, except that we exceeded our first year opening margin expansion goal basically achieving 170 basis points. So we are now one year or three up, 43% of our goal. So we are a little bit ahead of what we had committed to and as stated by Mike, we certainly didn’t want to assume a second fantastic year like this one or at least provide that as a guidance at this place, at this time and decided to have a guidance that is somehow conservative.  But nothing has fundamentally changed, but the moving parts are really I mean like this. I mean the salary increases, I mean all the different components, the new trends to our projections regarding the benefits from the NMR exit, from the Agile Agilent program, from the fact that we have the FDA warning there behind us, the OSS, the order fulfillment annual improvement, there’s really no chance. The only chance I would say is a positive chance we’re slightly ahead of the game at the end of Tier 1. Yes Dane, if I could just add some additional comments here too. So we’re really quite pleased with how we performed this first year. I think we’re well in that trajectory to 22% and finally we found a way to get there even if we got a little bit lower on the top line revenue.  I also would say that part of our thinking was influenced by many of our major systems infrastructure programs, which I think I’ve talked to you in the past around the Agile Agilent. These are multiyear programs and a lot of them will start hitting into the end of 2016. So we started to get the real big million dollar cost savings coming out of our infrastructure in ’17. So we’re right on our plan, in fact ahead of our internal plan. So we’re quite confident in our ability to get to that 22, but there are some timing issues related to some of our major, major programs.  Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Mike, we focused a lot here on the impact of chem and energy. I wonder if we could think about a couple of potential catalyst to the upside; one is NIH budgets. And to what extent are you thinking about the possibility of stronger funding for the NIH and if the NIH gets something like a plus five for 2016, what does that mean for your business? Yes, let me make some general comments and then if you have anything specific to add onto that, Patrick that would be great. Clearly if the NIH funding would go up, that would be a positive for the business, albeit I think as Patrick will share, it’s not a huge part of the overall funding for our company, but that will be positive news and that’s also as I said earlier, we’ll watch the business for the next quarter or two and kind of see where things go. So if these positive developments happen, it will be reflected in our view of the outlook for the business.  But what we did want to do is plan on a lot of good news now given some of the uncertainty of either budgets being finalized or where some of these end markets and economies are going. And Patrick, I can’t remember the exact percentage of our funding to NIH. So maybe you can add a little color there as well. Well, I don’t have the exact funding, but I agree with you that we didn’t bake in numbers like the ones have just been mentioned, certainly not the 5% they are going at low single digit projections on the budgets. So if there is upside, we’ll be happy to take it. Okay, thanks for that. And then just one for Jacob. I\\'m sorry, if you wouldn’t mind, could you give just us a bit more granularity on the performance of Dako in the quarter. I’m not sure if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you give a growth rate and any additional color on the driver and dynamics, whether they are competitive or otherwise really appreciative? Thanks so much. Hey Steve, as you know we don’t provide insight on the individual divisions, but I can say that we continue to see strong performance in our pathology business and this continues to break records in placements and that obviously is driving the growth there. So we see great growth there in our companion diagnostic business, with all the activities around the recent launches within the PDL-1, it’s also a great growth driver. So overall I see great momentum in the businesses, but the actual number I cannot comment on. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you. I wanted to drill down on the pharma and biotech end markets a little bit, and the strongest growth for you this year last year and it sounds like next year that expectation is that it would continue to be your strongest grower. Can you talk about some of the technologies that you are seeing being the strongest drivers of that growth and how you are addressing that market and also I\\'d like to hear about whether this is big pharma, is it small midsize pharma, is a contract labs, what kind of clients are you seeing driving the growth? Thanks. Yes, so these are several questions at once. So let me start with the platforms that drive the growth. Actually we had very competitive platforms for the pharmaceutical and the biopharmaceutical markets. The biggest growth driver right comes actually out of the LC business, which drives a lot of replacement business off the installed basis.  You probably know we had more than [140,000 1,100] [ph] systems installed worldwide. A lot of them are in the pharma space and the offering we have today with the Infinity II series gives a seamless replacement of the systems which have a much higher performance, better efficiency, so a huge improvement from our customers. So that resonates well and it resonates actually well across the board, whether its smaller pharma or large pharma. The large deals of course come mainly out of the large pharmas and we have seen several big deals in the U.S., as well as in Europe in the last quarter. The second piece of the question was regarding biopharma. In biopharma we see actually higher growth moving forward than in small molecule pharma and we continue to address this also with more specific solutions around our LCMS portfolio and some of it also in the spectroscopy space.  So I think we have a very attractive portfolio for our customers. We have a lot of good new releases. This year out with the 6470 Triple-Quad system which is well received from pharma as well and they will continue to drive growth for us in this space. And Patrick, if I can just add one final comment here. Tim, your focused on the technologies driving a lot of the growth in our reported pharma results, but also call your attention to the Agilent CrossLab group who delivered another double digit growth in the fourth quarter and we’re seeing strong demand for our services in consumables CrossLab services and consumables in the pharma as well as our technology offerings. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Maybe just to follow-up on the pharma. I mean you guys have been trending along the 6% to 8% growth, but the 19% growth really stands out. Was there anything one-time that you saw this quarter on the pharma business that you can call on? Tycho you broke up a bit. I think what you asked was we had put up double digit growth and was anything of a one-time nature in this most recent quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the question. Yes, I mean you have been kind of growing pharma 6% to 8%, so 19% was certainly notable. So was there anything you can call out that was unique to the quarter? No, we had several quarters in a row where we had double digit growth in pharma, so it’s really and as Mike said, moving forward we see it continue to grow into high single digits at least. Okay, and then for Didier, I’m just trying to understand the explanation on the free cash flow down 20% in six months relative to what you said at the end of May, currency hasn’t really moved. So I’m just trying to understand the explanation there. So since in May we provided the number at the Analyst and Investor Day, just taking away all the one-time cash outflows that we had during the year, which are related to the separations deal where we had to pay a lot of invoices related to the separation and also, I think about $50 million of taxes that were related to the separation also.  So my point was just the number that we have now is even better, because it is the number that includes those elements, even better than the 555 that we provided that excluded those elements. So we have a better operating cash flow than we projected in May, however it is not as good as the one as we projected back in November of the previous year and mostly related to currency. Okay, and then last one just capital deployment. You highlighted Seahorse and Cartagenia, should we assume deals of similar magnitude going forward or do you have an appetite to potentially do something a little bit larger? Yes, we’ve talked about it at the Analyst and Investor Day of potentially two deals of the size of Seahorse per annum. Obviously it could be slightly bigger, but we were not looking at any larger deals in the short term, but we are ready to take on the two deals of that size per year perhaps, slightly bigger. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. So a couple of questions. First of all, could you talk about the academic? I\\'m a little bit surprised just given that some of your competitors like Sterno have a much bigger academic exposure, basically didn\\'t call it anything unusual in September. So could you talk a little bit more about that and particularly what did you see in October since you guys got a little bit longer. No, I’ll take that again. Again the compare for us this quarter was mainly a difficult compare, because we had a strong Q4 last year with double digit growth with some exceptional large deals in this space. The pause or the slowdown we have seen in September, where they usually have low budget release to some extent came back in October, so we’ve seen for the year and we are on track with what we project in the low to mid single digit growth rate for academia and government. Got you, but I just wanted the clarity, thank you. And could you give a little bit more color. I mean your 4.25% core growth, what are you sort of looking for core growth in each of the segment; LS, DX, at CrossLab?  So yes, we are not providing the projections per segment, however I will tell you and that won’t surprise you that our instrument segment LSAG will have slightly lower than the average and our other two segments Agilent CrossLab and DGG will have higher growth rate than the average. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, could you talk about the level of visibility in the budgets and chemical and energy end market and just do you feel like things have begun to bottom out now after a few quarters in the exploration business? I can take this, yes. So you’re actually right. We see currently marketing really bottoming out, so we don’t expect any major further declines on the exploration side, which gives us confidence that the growth rate that Mike projected and being in the low single digits combined chemical energy should also materialize moving forward. We are now like four to five quarters in this situation with the low oil price and we had been mainly hit in the first couple of quarters on the exploration side and now we see this really bottoming out. Got it, that’s helpful. And then just one more on the deal environment, just curious if you had any updated thoughts on the cash that your holding overseas. Thanks. Yes, I mean we have about $200 million of cash we had at the end of October in the U.S., plus $235 million in escrow for the Seahorse, which was put to good use on November 1. The rest of the cash is overseas. We’ve had a good year in terms of being able to repatriate some of that overseas cash into the U.S., that’s why we ended there with $435 million about and we are looking for continued support to bring back some of the cash tax effectively, but you feel most of the cash that we generate is overseas. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good evening. Most of my questions have been addressed already, but Mike, just one for you on the decision to expand the capacity of the nucleic acid solutions business. You clearly speak to the drivers of that decision and exactly where capacity utilization is today and what the, I guess P&L effects in terms of growth, the implications are in 2017, around that. Brandon, thanks. I’d love to take that call. It’s a great story and I think I’ll allow Jacob the pleasure of responding to that one. Yes, thank you. So as you know our nuclear gases solution division is manufacturing oligos for active pharmaceutical ingredients and we have seen a significant demand for those products over the last few years and we continue to see demand that actually is beyond our current capacity, and therefore we’ve decided to invest in expanding that capacity over the next few years and this is actually what has been reflected in that buy. This activity will set in the DGG business. Brandon, this is Mike again. The beauty of this business is we will get long term customer commitments for purchase volumes and then you’ll start to see this show up in a very significant amount of revenue as you get in the outer years like ’17 and ’18 for the company. That’s helpful, and then Didier, just one clarification. Did you say that you’ve embedded the mid to high single-digit growth outcome for China for ’16, was that right? I think that was me. I said we were expecting mid single digit growth in China and what could happen Brandon, kind of what happened in the chemical and energy, we could see that get to high single digit growth as an overall market. Just some additional color here. We expect the pharma, the food and environmental segments to continue to be quite strong as an end market, along with continued interest in the services and consumables. Again the wildcard that will lure us between the two estimate points would be what growth rate we would see in the chemical and energy space, but it looks like a solid growth market for us year and then again what happens to chemical and energy, we could see more end market growth than what we are projecting now.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on this last comment here. On China and the chemical and energy business, have you seen that deteriorate further or how are the orders tracking in that business given the macro headwinds coming out of China? Yes Miro, this is Mike, thanks for the question. Although we don’t specifically comment on orders, what I can just refer you to is your overall view of the results for the quarter in a revenue standpoint and its four quarters in a row are flat. I believe earlier Patrick used the comments that we think we bottomed out and I think that applies to China as well. Sounds good, thank you for that comment. Secondly, just given the sort of mixed end market environment for you. Wondering how are you prioritizing your investments for fiscal ‘16? Has anything changed in terms of your thinking there as well as the level of investment you devote to each of the end markets? Great question, and I think as you know we try to align our investments to where we see the best growth prospects. But I have to say that the market has been fairly consistent in terms of how it’s developed relative to our internal view of where to place our bets and I’d say no. I don’t think there’s any really fundamental changes to our investments and technology front or in places where we are building out our channel coverage.  Okay, sounds good. And lastly, for Didier, the negative 1.7% of currency you see next year, what kind of flow-through should we assume on EPS? Similar to what we have seen in 2015, so about 20%. We think that currency will have an impact of about $68 million for the year and the impact on the operating profit is about 14, 15.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. So based on what I am hearing from a lot of folks who are listening to this call, I think there is a little bit of a debate as to how to view your guidance. I think that’s a clear observation at this point.  So Mike, you acknowledge previously that you maybe should have guided ‘15 to maybe slightly more conservative levels and now we have fiscal ‘16 guidance and like I just said I think a lot of folks are trying to figure out how much of this guide is you swinging to the other extreme, which seems pretty prudent for a variety of reasons, including the macro backdrop or is there something fundamental you are seeing as giving your reason for a pause. So if I could just, as we are kind of getting into the end of this call, take another shot at asking a couple of questions?  The first would be your guidance implies that margin will expand, operating margin will expand by 50 to 100 basis points this year and then 150 to 200 basis points in fiscal ‘17, if I’m doing the math right. How much is that dependent on a favorable changes in revenue mix relative to recent trends?  The second question would be recognizing a key focus area for you Mike has been to bring much of what you successfully did with Chemical Analysis to broader Agilent. Is the variable cost structure progressing to the point where you still feel comfortable that you can get to that 22% margin target in fiscal ’17, even if core revenue growth is, say, 4% to 4.5% the next couple of years.  The third question would be getting at really the question of fundamental demand and recognizing you don’t want to get into book-to-bill’s for the reasons that your outlined previously. To be fair, a lot of your peers do comment at least on demand coming out of the quarter, heading into the end of the quarter. Given the performance and LSAG it seems like it would be helpful for you guys to at least say something about trends there.  And the last one would be, Tycho asked a question about free cash flow guidance for fiscal ’16. To be more specific, at your Analyst Day you guided us to expect $620 million in free cash flow this year. Your guidance is now for $510 million. So FX has changed, but really only a little bit and I know there a lot of one timers in there. But a $110 million is a big delta. Can you just walk us through what’s going on there? Thank you. Sure Dough, these are very important questions. So I appreciate the opportunity to add some additional clarity. So if I miss anything please come back to me, but I think I’ve got the key points here. One is, let’s start with the view of 22%, how depended it is on a higher level of revenue.  As I may have indicated earlier in a call its 4%, 4.5%, we will make the 22% operating profit in 2017. And I say that with a lot of confidence, because of the results we have put up over the last three quarters, plus I know we have a number of major programs that we have to deliver on their projected cost savings. You start to see those near the tail-end of ’16 going into ’17. They are completely independent of revenue.  We are assuming no significant change of revenue mix beyond what we have shared at the Analyst Day and also what you saw in the results. We do expect our ACG and DGG Groups to grow faster than LSAG, but LSAG will also grow. We do expect our non-instrument product lines to grow faster.  And in terms of the commentary, we saw no real change in fundamental demand coming through and existing the quarter. The comments we made about revenue I think speak directly to how we saw the quarter develop, and again back to how you made it all off a question. I mean part of it is a reflection on 2015 guidance and also the fact that we do want to be prudent out the gate and a little bit more conservative. It’s still early in the year, and there are couple of things that are trying to handicap in terms of what’s going on with chemical and energy, how will the emerging markets hold up in some of the economic concerns they have.  But I would not at all take this as a lack of confidence in the business going forward or any kind of significant last quarter changes. In fact we are really, really pleased with the way the year closed, the numbers we put up and how they closed off our first year.  So Didier, I’m going to let you handle the last questing of the bridge between the free cash flow of 620 to... Well, so in the past I had talked about 2015 and the fact that we ended about high free cash flow that what I had motioned at the time, and the reason why you don’t – I mean we are not comparing apple-to-apple is just because of the one-time expenses. So if you want doing the follow-up calls and I will do that with each of you. We can go over the one-time items and the impact those have. That’s probably the best to do. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe just two quick ones for me on NMR. Mike, how removed are you at this point from that business, and from the servicing of your customers there and then Didier, can you just touch on what you are assuming for operating profit improvement in 2016 for NMR?  Sure, relative to NMR, as you know we excited the NMR hardware business but have maintained the service relationship and that continues to go very well in terms of our ability to service and support our customers and it’s really a major part of our thinking when we closed down the hardware business. But we really wanted to preserve and mitigate the impact of our customers. So we are in a position to be able to handle their long term service needs. And Didier, I think you’ve got some specifics on the expectations for next year.  Yes, there is no change to the guidance that we have provided. We had about $15 million of cost reductions and expense reduction in fiscal year ’15. Next year we anticipate an additional $5 million, in line with what we had previously stated.  And I think you guided Didier some revenue flow through as we work-off the last part of the backlog in ’16. So there will still be some.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.  Thanks Paul. I appreciate the opportunity to answer. Great, great question. So we see the U.S. as a real area of strength, albeit some of the commentary around what may happen in terms of the chemical energy space and how its impacting the U.S. business. So we see the market there being very robust and was a source of strength for the company for the quarter and for the year. So we are looking forward to continued strength in the U.S.  And I think the same call in Europe and Europe holds as well. I think part of our European business the report has been – it includes some of the Middle East and Eastern European courtiers and would have been a little bit of a challenge for us, particularly in the chemical and energy space. But overall Western Europe and Germany in particular has been extremely strong for us and we are seeing no indication of that is changing for us in our European based business.  And then lastly when you look at the energy sector, I know there is a lot of pieces like gas Chromatography and Spectroscopy on the metals mining side, but weren’t you already seeing that market pretty soft in the earlier quarters of this fiscal year Mike and I guess the short question is it’s been weak already, has it not? Yes, that’s correct Paul and you hit the right categories where it really affects our gas Chromatography business where we have such a strong position in that segment. I think that was one of the mix issues that Patrick had alluded to earlier. And then in the metals and mining, that’s where we really have seen a slowdown as it relates to our Spectroscopy business.  So you might look at say in 2016 that we could see some reported revenues versus easy compares, but we’ll wait till we call it in. But again, we think that it looks like to us that the market may have bottoms and that perhaps the worst is behind us.  Right, you have been through a few cycles yourself running that division. I mean what does the market feel like? You sense the bottom in some of these categories? Yes, I mean we think so. I mean customers are starting to talk about the new technologies and replacement, particularly as it relates to data systems and associated systems. Some of the customers are still fairly conservative. You know BASF was out with a downgrade in term of their outlook for ’16. But at the same point in time, the equipment is required to keep their facilities running at the highest levels of operational efficiency, so there is an active funnel. So we now are seeing to start closing some business.  Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Your line is now open. Thank you; two quick ones. One Didier, is there anything you would like to call out on the quarterly cadence in 2016 as we consider our models. I mean presumably Q3 is going to be a very difficult comparison.  And then secondly for Jacob, is there any effort or plan to migrate a couple of these companion diagnostic approval to the ominous system. I looked like they were approved on your older Autostainer. Thank you.  So on the first question, Dan we will have the usual higher operating margin in the second half than in the first half based on volume and also because on the actions that we are taking throughout the year, which will have a more of an impact in terms of cost and expense reduction, already in the second half because of the carry over impact. So you should see a fairly steady ramp in operating margin throughout the year, very much in line with the usual seasonality and the pattern. One Didier, one additional thought here might be looking at Q2, Q3 revenue year-over-year and that we had some logistical start up issues in our Q2 where we have some track revenue. Hey Dan, let me address the other question also. So you asked about the right that we developed the PD-L1 for the Autostainers right now, and the reason is that these activates is ongoing for many years also, so we start off with the Autostainers packing base, where we also have the highest installed base. But your absolutely right that we are actively also moving it over to the Ominous and will clear have our full portfolio on the Ominous going forward, including our companion diagnostics, so that will happen.  Thank you Sabrina and on behalf of the management team, I’d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to give us call on IR and I’d like to end by wishing everybody a good day. Thank you. Thank you.

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\\'s call. I\\'m pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings above the high-end of our guidance. I will now highlight three key results. First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year. Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical, and diagnostics markets with a return to growth in Academia & Government. Market demand remains strong for Liquid Chromatography, CrossLab\\'s services and consumables, and Diagnostics and Genomics offerings. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. Let me highlight the Q1 results by our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return on Academia & Government markets, and China government investment in Environmental and Food markets. All this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the Chemical & Energy market space. LSAG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent. LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released two new refracted index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food applications. Agilent\\'s innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an innovation award for our unique LC dual-needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent\\'s LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultra-low carryover. Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and Chemical & Energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offerings. Operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continue to bring novel new chemistries to market. For example, we\\'ve released advanced Bio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size-exclusion chromatography, targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continues to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rates. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing rev for new PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum. Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets and the favorable compares. DGG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%. That\\'s up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015. Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s, OPDIVO, was approved by the FDA for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved expanded use of this PD-L1 diagnostics to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved tests for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers. Now I\\'ll take a brief look at Agilent\\'s revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our Clinical and Diagnostics revenue was up 7% and we experienced a return to growth in Academia & Government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S. Applied end-market performance was generally soft except for Environmental, which was up 9% driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our Food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical & Energy declined 2% driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns. Let me provide an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving a sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategies. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we call this One Agilent. As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here\\'s what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S. defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I\\'ve also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start of the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook. The principle of new Agilent is to be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end-markets and emerging economies. The good news is that we see solid market conditions in other end-markets and geographies. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course corrections as market conditions dictate. We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior-year introductions, we have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem with these new offerings, we are creating a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us. And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win in the marketplace. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier? Yes. Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high-end of our revenue and EPS guidance, even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million. The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. I\\'ll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2016 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last two weeks, we\\'ve seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance. Turning to our share buyback program, we remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before our fiscal year-end. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we\\'re expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1. The midpoint corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.37 to $0.39. Hi. This is Ryan Blicker filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Starting with operating margin guidance, it seems as though you reduced full-year guidance by about 10 basis points, but it seems as though most of that was FX. Can you confirm that that was all due to FX, or are there other changes we should be thinking about? No. It was entirely due to FX, absolutely. As I mentioned, the FX impact was $13 million and that is precisely the amount of the reduction in operating profit reflected in our guidance. And we have maintained the guidance at 20.2%, which was the average of 20% to 25% that we had guided to in November. No change. Okay. Thank you. And looking at the pharma end-market, obviously, another very strong performance in the quarter. Can you give us more details on what drove the strength and were there any one-time dynamics like a budget flush or pull-forward of revenue? And, I guess, lastly, do you still expect growth in this end-market to approximate high-single-digits for the full-year? Thank you. Hey, Ryan. This is Mike. Let me make a few comments on the pharma strength we saw in the first quarter. Clearly, no one-time events and we saw great pacing throughout the quarter. I just would highlight a few points here. One, we\\'re seeing a strong growth in Liquid Chromatography both in terms of the uptake and our new products, but also the technology refresh that is underway within the segment. Also, customers are responding quite positively to our biopharma solutions. And across the board, between biopharma and pharma, we\\'re seeing strong demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. 19% growth for the first quarter. We don\\'t expect that level of double-digit growth to continue all through the year, but we\\'re quite confident in our projections of high-single-digit. We\\'re calling for 8% overall growth for the year in pharma. So we see no signs that this market won\\'t remain robust for us for the rest of this year. Regarding the guidance of EPS, I know when you guided last time the euro had already fallen relative to the dollar. So are you measuring the euro on today\\'s exchange rate, last week\\'s exchange rate? I mean, could you flush out a little bit more? Yeah. Hi, Paul. So the guidance is always based on the exchange rate on the last day of the quarter we report. So the new guidance is based on the exchange rate as of January 30 of 2016. And it was between November – October 30, which was a November guidance and then January 30, which is the present guidance. The dollar strengthened, but we are seeing it weakening since November 30 a little bit vis-à-vis the euro, and certainly, vis-à-vis the yen. So if that continues, it will be reflected in our May guidance. Again, there was no change at all to our November guidance except for those that result directly from the change in exchange rates between October 30 and January 30. Yeah, Paul, if I can just emphasize that again, I mean, the fundamental assumptions we made that underlined our prior quarter guidance remain intact with the exception being FX. And then, lastly, Mike, what stands out on technology is the PD-L1 approval and also the large molecule technology in CrossLab, do you sit there with those two products on your menu thinking there\\'s a bias toward more organic? Or where are you at with those two that you mentioned? Paul, just to make sure I understand the question relative to -thanks for the comments and observations. Just to make sure I understand the question, this would be relative to our expectation of continued organic growth of those two new... Yeah. Are they enough to move the needle higher than what you would have thought 90 days ago on last guide? Well, let me make a comment on the CrossLab services and consumables, and then I\\'ll pass it over to Jacob on the PD-L1. When we put together our guidance for the year, we were expecting strong growth in our CrossLab services and consumables business. So that\\'s part of the reasons why we had a lot of confidence coming into this year and still have the confidence in this year about making our organic core revenue growth targets because have you seen even in the Chemical & Energy space, which is down in terms of new instrument purchases, they continue to buy and we see strong growth of services and consumables. So what I\\'ll leave you is we expect continued strength in that space, but we were assuming that to be the case, when we guided the company earlier this year. And, Jacob, why don\\'t you share your thoughts on the PD-L1? Yeah. Thanks, Paul. And you\\'re right that we got the indication approval also for the melanoma for the OPDIVO drug. And that\\'s a great next step in the opportunities for PD-L1. I will not say that it really changes some needle on an Agilent level, but it definitely is a part of our growth story in DGG. But I will remind also that this drug – or this companion diagnostic has only been out now for a few months. And we\\'re still in the early days of seeing the uptake of it. So I see good progress, but not something that really moves the needle here. Mike, last quarter you mentioned that industrial weakness you were seeing spilled over into the Environmental business? I\\'m just wondering whether that\\'s reversed a bit this quarter. So, I guess, is it fair to say that maybe growth in Environmental this year could be a couple of points higher than the cyclical segments? I guess, how would you just compare expectations for Environmental versus industrial for this year? Yeah, Dan. Thanks for the careful observation. And actually, the Environmental business was a pleasant surprise in the first quarter. We knew that China was going to be strong and we\\'ve been talking about China and our view of investments that the Chinese government\\'s making in places such as environmental market and food safety. But I will say that we\\'re happy to see the growth in other segments. Because, yes, the Chemical & Energy space has been under pressure, but what we\\'re still seeing is that fracking is still going on. So the production – while prices of oil are down, the production demand is stable. And, in fact, if you look at the gasoline production in the U.S., for example, it\\'s perhaps going up. So we\\'re seeing a continued need to do Environmental testing. So that\\'s been a nice reaffirmation, if you will, of our outlook for the year, which calling for low-single-digit growth in Environmental. We thought that China would carry the whole load for us, but I think we\\'re getting a little help from the U.S. as well. Okay. And then, maybe just staying in the BRIC region, any change in the way that you\\'re thinking about Brazil and Russia and how that might end up this year? Unfortunately, no. I think we\\'re still looking for very challenged conditions in those countries. I know there\\'s been some recent news today about Russia, and perhaps, working with some of the other oil-producing countries to change some aspects of production. Maybe they\\'ll have some dynamics in terms of their economy, but right now, we\\'re assuming continuation of the current challenged conditions for Brazil and Russia. Yeah. Mike, first question was on gross margin. There\\'s pretty big year-on-year improvement there, and I was wondering if you can maybe break down the key drivers of gross margin performance. The extent to which there might have been one-time benefits and the extent to which there are some items that are going to continue as the year progresses. Yeah. Why don\\'t I make a few high-level comments here, then, Didier, you can jump in and augment my comments. But I think one, there were some one-time improvements. And I think we highlighted those specifically as it related to DGG, where we had some revenue that was really trapped last year in the first quarter due to production issues. But the lion\\'s share of the improvement is resulting from our continued sustained efforts that I highlighted in my call. Both the portfolio efforts in terms of the businesses we\\'re no longer in, the businesses we acquired are changing our gross margin profile. We\\'re taking real cost out of our system through the Agile Agilent program. So there were some one-time events as it relates to the revenue for DGG, but the bulk of our margin improvement is from the underlying core efforts we\\'ve had over the last several quarters to fundamentally change the operating model of the company. Just to point that also contributed the number one – you will recall that last year we were spending heavily on remediation point to address the FDA warning letters. So that is now we\\'re spending significant amounts to maintain our strong position now, but certainly, not in the same magnitude of what we have spent for two years in a row. And then, the second point is there was a favorable mix. We talked about how strong the pharma business is and pharma does generate higher gross margin than the rest of the businesses. So favorable mix and the pharma being just one of them, but a significant one. And then, the FDA, the reduction of FDA spend also in addition to all the points that Mike has made. Okay. That\\'s helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up on CrossLab. You mentioned the driver there, looking like it was just healthy demand in the end-market. But I don\\'t think of that business as necessarily having a sustainable growth rate in that double-digit range. So I\\'m wondering if there was an element of market share that was helpful. It\\'s just not a market where we have a ton of quarter-to-quarter visibility, so I was wondering if you could put some color around the extent to which market share was helpful and how you\\'d characterize where it\\'s coming from. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. I\\'ll make a few comments, and Mark, why don\\'t you jump in with your thoughts here? As we looked at the overall growth rate for CrossLab, you should assume that we\\'re right in the range, where we talked about at the AID, and we think there\\'s both market growth, but as you pointed out, market share gain opportunities for us, where we really have changed our view of what the addressable market is for our business and it\\'s no longer the Agilent install base, but it\\'s the entire lab. Thanks, Mike. And I think you hit on the primary piece, which is we continue to see the primary drivers in pharma, and also, China has been very strong for us. When you pull it all back to when capital spending is constrained, we continue to see customers improve the productivity of their assets through services and the chemistries we talked about earlier. But I think what\\'s more robust than it was a year ago even is really the strength of our multi-vendor and enterprise portfolio. And that does allow you to take share, if you will, from the broader market. So I\\'m just trying to double-check on the guidance map here, because I think a few of us are a little bit confused. So we beat the quarter, right, by around – I don\\'t know – call it, $0.03. We lost $0.033 on FX roughly, and the range came down $0.04. So I\\'m just trying to get a sense for – again, it seems like FX was the key delta, but just the simple math would have suggested to me a little less downward pressure on the full-year range. And again, I realize there\\'s probably a few other moving parts. So I\\'m just trying to make sure I understand how we\\'re doing versus the plan for the year. Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we have reduced our top line revenue from a midpoint from $4.160 billion to $4.110 billion, which is a $50 million reduction. We\\'ve reduced our operating profit from $830 million to $817 million. That\\'s $13 million, and that\\'s entirely due to the impact of the strengthening of the dollar and related to the $50 million. And then, I mentioned $0.033, but with rounding, we are going from the midpoint of $1.88 to the midpoint of $1.84, and that\\'s $0.04, and that\\'s the $0.033, which is rounded because of the – going from one to the other, you can understand that. So basically, what we felt is even though we are starting the year very strongly, we felt that with the overall macroeconomic condition, it would not be wise at this point in time to change the guidance we have provided, core revenue guidance of 4% to 4.5%. We have the same confidence as we had in the month of November, when we provided that guidance that we\\'re in good shape to hit it and perhaps beat it, but certainly, didn\\'t want to change it. Yeah. I guess, what I\\'m trying to get at is sort of the comments last quarter suggested sort of conservatism, right. You obviously can\\'t control what happens with the dollar, so that\\'s understandable. I\\'m just trying to get a sense for how much conservatism there is now in the forecast and whether or not we have risk to that core growth rate, given again that the range came down, but you reiterated the top line. Just making sure that we\\'re sort of not over-extrapolating here. Sure, Ross. This is Mike. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So if you go by the conservatism meter on our guidance, it\\'s at the same level as it was last quarter. So the only real fundamental changes from our outlook is the view on FX. That\\'s it. And that we saw no reason to change our core revenue growth to offset a part of the FX, because FX can go up and down and it\\'s too volatile nowadays to immediately – unless we see some long-term structural changes, as we have last year and we reacted accordingly. We were not going to react by what we believe are temporary changes in FX by actions on our structural spend. Okay. So, sorry. I\\'m going to monopolize for a minute, just because I\\'m trying to make sure my inbox lights up. I\\'m getting everyone the answers they need. So all right. To be clear, we have the FX hit. I\\'d love to also understand what were the key currencies, because most of us can see the dollar\\'s actually, again, we\\'ll see if it sustains, weakened a bit. And so it seems like it\\'s outside the euro and the yen that might have caused some of the headwinds. So I\\'d love to hear just a little bit of color on maybe it\\'s the yuan or some of the other emerging market currencies. And just to be clear also on the second point, so we didn\\'t really bake in the beat from this quarter. Is that where the conservatism comes in? And then, I\\'m done I promise. I\\'ll cede the floor. Yeah. I mean, in terms of the currencies we have a detailed model that takes into account obviously all the currencies. The dollar versus the euro or the dollar versus the yen had a major impact also, I think, dollar versus the British pound. And again, I mean, today\\'s guidance is based on the January 30 exchange rate, so the euro to dollar €0.84 and the yen – and vis-à-vis the yen at the U.S. dollar is ¥121.4 and we are seeing that at today\\'s rate if we had to provide the guidance based on just if we had to – we\\'re able to instantly reflect the currencies as of the day of the guidance, we\\'d have a very different guidance. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So question for Mike on Chemical & Energy. You were down 2% this quarter. The last couple of quarters you were down 9% or 10%. I guess, can you give us a sense for what\\'s happening on the E&P side? You talked about stability on the refining side, but what are you seeing on the E&P side. It seems like that\\'s what allowed the – I guess, the improvement relative to last couple of quarters. Yeah. Actually, it\\'s probably worth maybe just doing a little bridge on the last few quarters, because, in fact, we\\'ve seen relative flat performance over the last several quarters. And while instruments were down the percentage you were talking about, high-single-digits, we\\'ve seen a continuing ability to offset through services and consumables. So what I would say is that the Chemical & Energy market is sort of playing out the way we had expected for the year. So we wish we had a different story here, but the oil price is low as you know, but the product demand still remains pretty strong for our customers\\' products. So the refineries are running, the chemical plants are running, and then we\\'re really trying to sell to them new equipment based on a productivity message, but at the same point in time, recognize that if they use the equipment longer, it\\'s a good opportunity for us on the services and consumable side. One thing I would ask you to reflect on is that Q1 2015, as you dig into some of the numbers, Q1 2015 really was our best quarter for the whole year. I think we grew 3% in the first quarter of last year on a core basis. We ended up growing, I think, 1% for the whole year so that shows you were declining through the year. And so I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the numbers. We think it\\'s right in the range where we thought. Well, no, not really. I think, as you said, it\\'s playing out as we expected. There\\'s continued pressure on the exploration side and production side. But for the refinery side, demand really drives. Also, replacement business for us, we try to incentivize our customers and give them opportunity to upgrade to increase their productivity and efficiency. And on the chemical side, I would say that the lower feedstock prices have not yet fully materialized. So we stay with focus for the year to – for the whole segment to stay flat. Okay. And, Jeff, this is Mike. I think we shared these numbers with you in the past. But the way we looked at this – we always look at our business, say, about 15% or so is in E&P, as you described, exploration and production, which will be about 3% to 4% of our total revenues. About 35% of that segment is in refining and the other 50% is in chemicals. So that\\'s how we – it remains stable at a subdued level. I\\'d like to follow up just a bit on the pharmaceutical space. It was really helpful to hear just how confident you guys are in the outlook for the year growing 8% in pharma. I wondered if you can maybe add a little bit to the conversation, though, and talk about what you\\'re hearing, Mike or Patrick, in your conversations with pharma customers as they talk about their budgets for this year? I apologize for coming back to the topic, but there\\'s a lot of interest out there in the sustainability of growth in the space. So any color you could offer on how your customers are thinking would be really helpful. Sure. Thanks. So what we\\'re hearing from our customers is that actually they are holding their budgets. We don\\'t see any significant reduction there. And this comes, by the way, across the board from small and medium-sized and large enterprises. So it\\'s really for us, it\\'s a good mixture between different sized companies and also between the different markets. Talking about small molecule versus biopharmaceuticals, the growth really comes from both sides. And this is why we\\'re so confident that we will maintain to see this high-single-digit growth for pharma. And the other thing that we\\'ve done, so we\\'re getting broad-based demand across all segments of the market. Then we also continue to do our own math in terms of what\\'s out there, in terms of the install base of our products. So we have a pretty good idea of – at least on the technology refresh side how much more demand we can expect in the segment. That\\'s extremely helpful. One corollary, one follow-up there. I wonder if you could give us a sense for, to what extent, the success that you\\'re having in pharma and the success that you\\'re having in CrossLab are interrelated. Are those two perhaps a little bit more overlapping than CrossLab as with some of the other customer verticals? And to what extent, is one dependent on the other? Thanks so much. Great question. Happy to elaborate. They are highly connected. So when we talk about pharma market demand, it\\'s both driving new equipment purchases, which were the focus on Patrick\\'s comments, but also, there\\'s a demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. But on the CrossLab side, not only are they investing in ongoing chemistries and services to maintain their operations and support their application needs, what we\\'re also seeing is a change in the model. So what they\\'re doing is they are taking activities that historically have been done inside the company and are creating, if you will, a new set of services for vendors in our space to handle things such as asset management. And that\\'s creating a new set of services that are being created right now in pharma. We haven\\'t seen that new set of services demand develop yet on the Chemical & Energy side, but we\\'re hopeful that it will down the road. But there\\'s a couple of dynamics going on in the pharma space, which are driving both the new instrument purchases and the consumables and services from CrossLab. Thank you. Wondered if you could give us a update on market for tuck-in acquisitions. What you\\'re thinking about these days in terms of where you might like to plug some holes. And also, are you seeing more opportunities now that some valuations have come in? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate the opportunity to provide a perspective on here. So although we remain focused on our organic growth opportunities, we\\'ve got a lot of very exciting plans and new products coming out, and working on the go-to-market capabilities I mentioned in my call comments. We\\'re really continuing to look for acquisitions that augment our current portfolio and add to our company capabilities. And so I think you saw doing the Seahorse deal, where we added capabilities in life science, research, Cartagenia in the area of next-gen sequencing. We built out our workflow there. We\\'d still like to find ways to build out our workflow in next-gen sequencing. And so our stated strategies of really adding capabilities, expanding our portfolio, building on our workflow solutions with particular emphasis on life sciences, research, next-gen sequencing workflows in the overall consumables and services place, they\\'re our priorities. Well, that being said, most people still have the memories of the 52-week highs. So we\\'ll see how this plays out. And what I will tell you is we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about M&A and does it provide an attractive return to our shareholders, and can we do something to make the business better? If we can\\'t make the business better, it\\'s not something we\\'d be interested in. Mike, you pointed to strength in China in the period. Just curious, if you could elaborate on the actual growth rate in the first quarter and if there\\'s been any deviation from the mid- to high-single-digit target for the year? Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about China; one of my favorite topics. So we saw a very good demand in China, high-single-digit growth in our analytical lab business. And as I mentioned to you in the past, the markets here are really being driven by strong investments in government policy-driven initiatives around quality of life concerns, whether the environment, drug and food safety. So all the markets with the exception of Chemical & Energy really saw quite strong growth. And we\\'re underpenetrated in DGG business compared to the rest of the company. We\\'ve talked about that in the past. And we\\'re underpenetrated in a growing market for cancer diagnostics, for example. And I recently saw some statistics that I thought were really quite amazing. There was a report by the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said that every minute an average of six people in the country were diagnosed with cancer, and five of those six would eventually die of the disease. So unfortunately, there\\'s going to be growing demand for cancer diagnostics as well. I\\'m going to wrap this all up by saying we remain quite comfortable with the mid- to high-single-digit growth expectation we laid out for China. It was strong for us in the first quarter and we expect that to continue through the year. Then one more for Didier. Could you split out the contribution from Seahorse relative to the headwind from the NMR in the first quarter in terms of just dollars? No, no, no, we don\\'t provide guidance or information regarding the acquisitions. We have stated and we are exactly in line that we expect Seahorse revenue to grow double-digits in 2016 versus 2015. And we expect the Seahorse operating margin to be also in the double-digits. So no change to our expectations. Well, the integration of Seahorse is going very well. It\\'s giving us extended reach also into the research market, and this was the whole play. Plus, we, of course, used the opportunity to use our strength in pharma to sell these products into the pharma space in areas like disease discovery as well. And this will drive the growth in fiscal year 2016. As Didier said, we expect double-digit growth. We have the salesforce trained and we are looking forward to a very strong Q2, Q3, Q4 for this product line. Hey. How are you? Maybe just first on capital deployment, you did $200 million in buybacks in the quarter. You guided for $480 million for the year. I mean, it sounds like you all front-end loaded, and I mean, how do we think about a reauthorization once you get through this tranche, given your stock\\'s probably under some pressure tomorrow? Yeah. We basically decided to buy back in Q1 what we had not been able to do in Q4 of the preceding year. And then, we have filed a 10b5-1 with certain formula. But for your model, you should assume that we are buying about one-third of the remaining $280 million per quarter. And then, just to clarify on the margins, because I\\'ve had a few questions. I mean, the $13 million hit is the FX hit, but, I guess, people are having a hard time understanding why you\\'re not seeing faster-than-expected realization of the COGS and SG&A cuts that we saw some of that this quarter. Why doesn\\'t that carry through for the next three quarters? We\\'re not saying it\\'s not going to carry us through. We\\'re saying we saw no reason in the present environment to change the guidance on an operating margin basis, 20.2% that we had provided, 20% to 20.5% that we had provided previously, and again, with the same level of conservatism as we had in November. So that\\'s basically the – that was the premise for us maintaining both the core revenue growth and the operating margin we had provided in November. And, Didier, I\\'d just add, in my call comments, I tried to highlight a few things on a longer-term nature to show you that we\\'re not out of gas in this tank in terms of our ability to continue to move our operating margin. We have other larger-hitting programs that are coming in late 2016 and will carry on into 2017 as well. So this is not a one-time quarter where we just got a favorable mix, whatever. There\\'s real fundamental improvements underway in the operating margin capabilities of the company. And then, I guess, speaking of running out of gas, you talked about refiners holding up. There\\'s been news that at least two of the country\\'s largest refiners are cutting output of gasoline. What gives you conviction that your business there holds up? I\\'m not sure exactly what you\\'re referring to, but relative to our view is that gasoline will continue to be needed to run the economy, and there\\'s going to be demand there. And what we\\'ve tried to share, as long as production is running and there\\'s demand, the refineries will meet that demand. So we\\'ve seen no significant changes in the underlying demand for gas. And, in fact, Patrick, I think you were showing me some statistics the other day about what\\'s going on in the area of refineries in the U.S. Yeah. I mean, what we see, as Mike said, is the continued demand for – not only in the U.S., but also in the emerging economies like China. So the refineries are basically running at capacity right now. There will be no new builds, but we see that they\\'ve replaced existing equipment, and they also go into service contracts with us. They look for opportunities to drive more efficiencies, which gives us an opportunity to upgrade the install base with automation features and other things to make sure that the customers can save money with the equipment as well. So the oil price is clearly driven by the fact that there\\'s overcapacity on the production side. But the refinery volume has not gone down significantly over the last quarters. Okay. And then, just lastly, can you talk about linearity in the quarter? Anything notable in January? You guys have an extra month versus a lot of your comps, so just wondering if there\\'s anything worth calling out in January trends versus November and December? Yeah. No, I\\'d just point to two things. One is in terms of our normal seasonality through the quarter. Q1 of 2016 was like prior quarters. We always see a nice strong December as we close off year-end with our customers. And followed our typical seasonality patterns through November, December and January. I think probably the only thing of note would be in the DDG side. We had, I think, one less working day, I think, this year. So that does affect the Genomics business in terms of how much revenue we get in that quarter. But really, it was business as usual, if you will, through the first quarter. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on Tycho\\'s last question, just around the academic end-market. I\\'m curious, you mentioned in the presentation around some of the modestly larger research budgets being released in the U.S. Curious on your view on the NIH and really timing-related there, because of the timing of the Congressional approvals at year-end. Yeah. I can take this question here. We have seen moderate growth again in Academia & Government, which was a positive surprise. And as you all have read, there are more budgets available now in the U.S. These budgets are slowly released and drove some of the growth for us in Q1. And looking at the funnel moving forward, we actually see a good funnel there as well. So we stay with the forecast of low-single-digit growth for Academia & Government, at the moment, mainly driven by the U.S., which is where we see the strongest demand. Got it. And are your expectations for this level of growth to stay at the same rate through the end of the fiscal year? Are you assuming the budgets get released a little bit faster from here? If the budgets were to be released faster, I think, it would probably be upside for us. Our current view is low-single-digits for Academia & Government for the year. Got it. And then, just one other question on the margins in DGG, definitely appreciate the year-over-year improvement. I was wondering what your thoughts were bridging through the end of the year just given how the relative margins compared to the end of 2015. Thanks. Great. I know Jacob\\'s given a lot of thought to that potential question. So I\\'ll pass it over to you, Jacob, to provide some color there. Yeah. Thanks for that, Jack, and first of all, I want to say that very pleased to see the improvement versus the Q1 last year, but you\\'re also right that versus Q4 that we saw a bit of a decrease and that was actually where most expected. We sit in the DGG business with a pretty fixed cost base. So when you have a Q1 with the lower base than in Q4, you will see that our margins has also impacted economy. So you always see us coming out with a strong Q4 and a weaker Q1 and the gross margin also on our operating margin. So it\\'s kind of by the book and really as expected. Yeah. I would just add that there\\'s no change in plan and Jacob is still absolutely committed to reaching 20% operating margin in 2017. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your question please. So I\\'m just curious. You\\'re guiding to a 22% operating margin for 2017, so that\\'s implying – assuming the 20.2% midpoint, 130 basis points to 180 basis points of margin expansion next year. I\\'m just curious, if you couldn\\'t find 10 additional basis points of margin expansion in 2016 to offset the impact, what gives you confidence you\\'re going to be able to get 130 basis points, 180 basis points next year? I\\'d just reiterate – great question this one. Again by the way, one of the things as you heard me say earlier in my comments, we continue to make sure we\\'re realistic and we think about our business not on some hope and a prayer, but we actually have solid plans behind our long-term operating goals. And I think we have a lot of confidence for two reasons. One is we have a plan that can get us there with not all the top line, it\\'s probably in the range of 4% ago, we can get to the margin goals. We\\'ve laid out a plan that\\'s got 60% of this coming from the cost side. And we have multi-year programs that are going to take significant cost out of our structure. So I highlighted a field in my call, I mean, changes in terms of our benefit structure, changes in terms of our IT cost, our IT systems. It is a major company-wide initiatives that right now we\\'re underway. You won\\'t start to see them going through the P&L until like late 2016 going into 2017. So these are the kind of things that give us confidence to say, okay, there\\'s a path that gets us to where we want to get to in 2017. Okay. Great. It was the late 2016, early 2017 that, I think, that was the key that I was looking for in that. Second question. Second question is given some of the turmoil going on in Europe, have you seen any changes in the academic or government spending like the governments grapple with the refugee crisis and everything that\\'s going on? Is there any noticeable change to spending patterns in Europe? Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So on the gross margin line, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of the product mix? As I look at the different groups really the margin leverage seem to come through the Life Sci and Applied Markets Group. You guys almost reported a 59% gross margin there. Comment on the mix, please, and why margin for that Group specifically is expected to moderate when, I guess, historically it\\'s been pretty steady quarter-to-quarter throughout the year? I think there are two things I would point to and then, Didier, feel free to jump in in as well. But first of all, remember, the change we\\'re making to our portfolio. So we\\'ve exited the NMR hardware business and we\\'re starting to see some of those margin improvements shown on the P&L where we had revenue in the NMR business and much higher revenues in FY 2015. And then, our pharma business is pulling a lot of Liquid Chromatography, which is one of our highest gross margin products. I think it\\'s really perhaps those are the things... You said it all. Absolutely. I had mentioned earlier that the favorable mix came in part from the pharma mix. And within pharma, clearly Liquid Chromatography has the higher-than-average operating margin and gross margin. So to clarify, you felt that there was either a catch-up ordering or stocking in the quarter on those products specifically that\\'s not expected to continue for the rest of the year? Well, you can almost think about pharma – we had 19% pharmaceutical growth in the first quarter. What we\\'re saying is we can\\'t expect 19% to happen each of the next three quarters, what we do expect is continued strong demand, and right now, we\\'re calling 8% for the entire year. So that\\'s what you\\'re seeing in terms of reflected in our mix column as it relates to gross margin. Okay. And then, on the FX rate, so if you just use the DXY proxy, right, the last quarter was actually pretty elevated, but since then, the trend has actually come back into closer to where you guided the year. Are you expecting – is there some nuance within this on how certain currencies have moved? Or are you just assuming worst-case that the dollar goes back up here? It\\'s just pure math. So we\\'re not making any projections at all about future levels of FX. What Didier has done is, he takes the currency spot rates on the last day of the reported quarter, and that\\'s how we guide the company. We say okay, that\\'s what we know and we\\'ll assume that rate stays the same the rest of the year, and then, it\\'s just pure math from there. And that\\'s why I made a comment on my script that would we had used, for example, today\\'s exchange rates, the guidance would have been higher, because the dollar between January 31 and today has weakened. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. We\\'d like to wish you a good day, and I\\'m sure we\\'ll be talking later. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2016 Agilent Technologies, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you, Sabrina, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2016.

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Before turning things over to Mike, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York City on May 25. Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent Investor Relations website. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\\'s call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter for the Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight three key results. First, revenue growth was up over 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4% an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year. Before moving on to a view of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons which reflect the unusual event from last year of 8% core growth that we\\'re announcing today about 1.5 percentage points is due to our shift of our revenue last year from Q2 \\'15 into Q3 \\'15. In the second quarter year ago, we experienced $50million of shipment delays due to startup challenges with our new U.S. logistic center. In addition, our process improvement efforts over the past two quarters to convert our incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid-off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times particularly in China. Consequently some shipments initially forecasted for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. Agilent\\'s strong Q2 results were led by double digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in Academia & Government, Environmental and Diagnostic and Clinical Markets. All end markets grew except Chemical & Energy. Growth was broad based across our most of our portfolios. Geographically all regions grew except Japan led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8% led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About three percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year\\'s U.S. logistic centre startup. A combination of strong topline growth, expense management and growth margin improvements partially due to the NMR exit drove LSAG\\'s operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strength this portfolio in Q2 as it introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent’s leadership decision in metabolomics. Last week we announced a new Agilent 1260, infinity-II LC at the analytical trade show. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves the formats of full backward compatibility. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continued to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10% led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be the strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus year ago at 21.5%.CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I’m pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with 2016 Reviewers Choice award for customer service. This award is from Select Science, an independent expert led scientific review. This is the second year in a row, that scientists in North America have judged Agilent\\'s customer service to be the best in the Laboratory products industry. Finally the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on its steady trajectory back to market growth rates., highlighted by the strong demand for our new PD-L1companion and complimentary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance led by our SureSelect Target Enrichment and our Array CGH offerings. DGG\\'s operating margin was flat versus year ago at 15%. In Q2 Agilent announced an $80million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. In Q2, Agilent also announced the commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1diagnostic test for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO. Now, I’ll provide an overview of Agilent\\'s core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14% fueled by technology research deals, new product uptick, and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid to high double digit growth in pharma. Academia & Government grew 7% driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics led by target enrichment in Array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Flu was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now, I’d turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This will resolve our ability to outgrow the market while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company, making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of companywide streamline of organizations, processes, and systems continues to be on track to deliver incremental saving in 2017. For example, in Q3, we will take a major step forward in simplifying the company\\'s system infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested 80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our one Agilent initiative driving was well-received cultural transformation to improve cost company collaboration and delivering of results. At last year\\'s Analyst and Investor Day described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I\\'d like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer term goals. After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth in 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we’ve now had two strong quarters to start 2016 including this quarter\\'s 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent leadership team has put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We’ve completed the offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the Company\\'s split. In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 onto now, we’ve also invested our 400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later while we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS, and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half \\'16 forecast in light of what we’ve already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. We look at today\\'s overall market environment while we face increasingly tough competitors, we expect strength and pharma are continuing the second half of 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in second half of 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we’ve been experiencing a more prolong and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time with a recent well reported spill over into the refining segment. There are initial indications however of a bottoming with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. We have projected an improved chemical and energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are two reasons for this increase. First, we expect to have a very strong new product introduction in the second half of FY \\'16 which will drive revenue growth in FY 17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year end, accompanied by continuing solid conditions and all of our other end markets and in China. Overall, we remain on track with your 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins to 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the one Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day where I will share our progress versus our commitments. How we will sustain our improved performance and the longer term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Didier? Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again. 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year’s $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launched our new U.S. logistic center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market. During the quarter, we bought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At mid-point, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis, or close to 3% adjusting for last year’s $15 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now, to the guidance of fiscal year 2016. We are raising the mid-point of our revenue guidance by $60 million including $50 million due to currencies. As a result, we are increasing our core revenue growth guidance at mid-point from 4.25% to 4.50%. We are also raising the mid-point of our EPS guidance by $0.06 including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method account. This means that we will not book our share Lasergen losses as previously communicated. Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million and there is no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Thank you. Two questions. First off, can you elaborate on the business trends you\\'re seeing in Europe? And then secondly on the pharma end market, can you talk about what gives you confidence in the fiscal \\'17 outlook that you have yet another strong year in pharma, following two years then of tough comps in capital markets, which have been more or less shut? Thank you. Thanks Dan. I think I’m actually going to pass that over to Patrick who is just back from a trip to Europe and maybe he can provide some insight on what’s going on in Europe and then also if he can pick up the question on pharma as well. Sure. I’m happy to do so. Let me start first giving you some insights on Europe. We have seen actually some decent growth in Central Europe, we have seen some weaknesses on what we call the idea was states Eastern Europe and that\\'s mainly driven by the Chemical & Energy market or the Energy market of that site. In Central Europe there is deadly strengths in Germany and other states around that. We still see some issues on academia and government side is rather flat, but pharma for example is also very strong in Europe. For your pharma question, overall we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma. For the remainder of this year we target low double digit growth for pharma and looking into 2017 we think the pharma market will be continue to be strong for us driven by two vectors. We see a continue demand in the replacement business and as you probably know we just launched at the Analytica conference we launched our new 1216-20L series as an example together with the InfinityLab consumables and service and we think that will drive – continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma. And then we see also continue demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with these more complex molecules in terms of analysis and we have a very comprehensive offering for a space as well. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. Congratulations on another great quarter, Mike. Can you maybe elaborate a little on - I think you said core guidance, and if I\\'m looking at your presentation, core revenue growth guidance in the third quarter is pretty precise at 1.3%. I think I just heard that you still expect pharma to grow low double digits. Could you give a little insight as to what you\\'re seeing in the third quarter? Yes, what we looked at was what\\'s our growth rate that we\\'ve had over the first half of this year and as we look into Q3 and Q4. And what I\\'d point to is a couple of things, Jonathan first of all tough compares and this is inclusive of a few one-time moves between quarters which actually were driven by improvements overall operation, so as Didier mentioned we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3 - which when we had our start up issues of the new logistics center. So we adjust for that to catch-up about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we’ve been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually install and we can recognize a revenue. In Q2 we actually see their expectations and we got there a lot faster we had thought. And what that meant was, we had a significant amount of revenue probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially had forecasted into the third quarter. On all of you kind of take into account those things you\\'ve got put in more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. I would tell you though the chemical and energy is still looking for a bottom and that\\'s why we have that outlook for the year which basically this down it will stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have not convinced yet we\\'ve seen the bottom chemical and energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook on chemical and energy is what\\'s driving the overall guidance for the second half. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, I guess just one more. Are there any - sometimes when we see shifts onto one platform, like Oracle to SAP, is there anything at all, any wiggle room you\\'ve left there, in terms of hiccups in the quarter, or maybe just --? What we thought to do you\\'re exactly right Jonathan. So the wiggle room we left was we made sure we went live first month of the quarter. And Didier is in the conference room here smiling and Didier if you want to add any additional color on how it\\'s going so far. Yes, it\\'s going very well the migrations and the start up of the operation there was zero disruption. Obviously we expect to have to deal with some stabilization activities throughout the quarter we\\'ll do too close before we do the quarterly close. So everything we couldn’t be happier about how it went and you\\'re correct, it is a very complex and one that we\\'re pretty used to, we’ve done a few of those in the past, but still it remains a very complex interview and we are really happy how smoothly it went. And Jonathan as I pointed out in my script, this is one of the Agile Agilent initiatives which you\\'ll start to see pay offs in our cost structure as we move into 2017. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Just following up on that last point on the SAP margins, can you maybe - on the margin impact. Can you maybe quantify how much that could play on margins for this year? For 2016 I think it would be very limited at best Tycho, because we’ll be running some duplicate backup systems and then the other aspects of our external spends, later on come out to 2017. So I really position that in - as you think about this more of the 2017 impact, but prove point why we think we\\'re going to be able to improve our margins again in 2017. And then academic, 7%, can you maybe just talk as to whether you\\'re seeing an acceleration there? What you saw this quarter? Yes, what we saw in the last quarter is really strong performance in China and some increased signs of life in the U.S. side of things, I think and that\\'s will be pointing to an uptick. None a lot of significant moves on the European side is mainly a China story, and I think there\\'ll be upside to it to become from the U.S. how we\\'re thinking about it. Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of pharma, obviously that\\'s been a nice driver. Can you maybe talk about where you think we are in the LCMS upgrade cycle, and how much your growth going forward is going to be contingent on R&D budget expanding versus the upgrade cycle? Yes sure Tycho great question, I know Patrick now look at this pretty closely and what’s the update of you on that. Yes, so I think the two cycles we’re looking at, the first sight we went through was the upgrade cycle from sell HPLC to UHPLC which is still ongoing but a considerable part of that probably has been done. But when you look at the installed base of instrumentation it still deals with core LC and this is where we are targeting with the Infinity II Series right now. There\\'s still a lot of foot placement pending out there. Just as reminder, we had probably about 150,000 systems out there based on the 1100, 1200 platform which overtime will be up for replacement and we have positioned extremely well in the pharma platforms because it\\'s 100% bankruptcy compatible and we’re also able to for example to emulate some of our competitor systems on our platforms of a technology we called ISET intelligence system emulation technology. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi thanks. Good afternoon guys. I just wanted to start, the better - at least relative to what I was looking for, looked like you had better gross margins in the LSAG segment, now two quarters in a row. Can you just talk about what some of the notable changes there are? Is there anything with product mix that\\'s driven the improvement, or do you think this is the new norm to look for? Let me make some initial comments and then Didier or Patrick you can add – build to it. So in terms of product mix, part of what you\\'re seeing is the fact that we are winding down through our P&L the impact of the NMR business, and I think you can see the benefit of that exit decision on the P&L because it really has been contributing to the - improved the gross margins. That\\'s not the whole story. The other story is obviously the strong demand for the products and the volume benefits we\\'re getting, as well as the focus on taking cost out of our material cost side of our business as well as we talk a lot about the logistics last year, we can also talk about logistics this year, which is we\\'re doing a much better job in terms of overall logistics operations that\\'s blowing through on the P&L as well. Great. And then just one more for the adoption of the companion diagnostics, now a few quarters into the launch. Are you in a position, could you maybe help us size what that business is today, or just in the market, what you think you hold in terms of market share? Thanks. Yes, thanks for that question and we are definitely pleased with the pick off the PD-L1 and this continues during the last basically now three quarters. The market is still very early. We still really only in U.S. we’ve had a press releases here lately also that we are entering into Europe but we are just scratching the surface in Europe. And furthermore it’s still addressing the second line treatment and if that also goes to the first line treatment the market will become significantly larger. At this point of time it’s still small revenue in the biggest scheme of things but I do believe that the PD-L1 has an opportunity to be as big as the other two markets. However, I will also remind you that of at least four probably five different potential blocks and companion diagnostic outset has to share that market. So, still early days but a great opportunity. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Mike or Didier, could you give us the China growth rate, the percentage change in the quarter, and if you could speak to demand in the food area outside of China and Asia, that would be helpful? Yes. In the China our resolve for Q2 what we\\'ve been pointing to is a strong double digit growth. It was a very, very strong quarter for us in China, I would remind you that part of the strong growth was not only the strength of the market but also the operational efficiency improvement I talked about, where we really shortened the improved cycle time from orders to install that was really dramatic in China. So, the overall business is quite strong here, you should not expect a strong double digit growth every quarter though for Q3, Q4 quarter. But, overall China is - Mr. McMullen completed the story here. When we came into this year, we thought that the overall performance for Agilent in China might be high single digits but now look a low double digit growth in China for the full year. Thanks. One more for Didier. I notice you bumped the operating cash flow guidance of about $90 million. How much of an impact does the - I noticed the tax refund benefit. If you could quantify that, and just help us bridge the delta between prior versus new? The over-all tax outlays forecast for this year, were I think about $10 million less than what we had anticipated in our initial guidance, $10million or $15million. And the rest is really operational performance, improvements, working capital, management, FX and then just our operating profits. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, guys. Mike, since taking over it\\'s obviously been a pretty hectic journey, and your messaging from the beginning has been pretty consistent around growth in margins and returns. Obviously, the last few quarters you started develop a cadence, last quarter results were good, but we had the challenges on FX. Do you feel like this is the first quarter where you feel like you got to deliver the full bag, where you were able to drop through the top line outperformance, which is clearly better than market, you drove the margins, you\\'re buying stock, the returns are up, the cash flow\\'s good, that you were finally able to show the market that the business model\\'s working, and that feeds, I guess, into your confidence also, I would assume, on 2017? Yes. I couldn’t said have better of myself. Thanks Ross for the question, I think that we’ve been working really hard over last four, five quarters with our new leadership team and as you look at everything came together this quarter, we had strong growth, and we had improvement in our operating margin that pointed out of 2015. But all of the factors really came together nicely in the second quarter, and I was particularly pleased on the more operational activities that we are working on inside the company. And that may not always be so apparent initially on the outside world, but you\\'re started to see the results. The fact we are doing, it’s just a logistic challenge, here I have to talk about near year compares but expects – actually is now contributing to improved results. Yes, we had a talk about the shortened cycle time for orders to revenue and burdensome revenues of what we’ve initially planned for the third quarter but we made this operational improvement the cycle times are shorter and this is now the new normal. So, I guess that was the closing comments, yes with a new normal for the company we have a lot of confidence about 2017. Perhaps, it’s been a little bit of thunder for the Analyst meeting next week but still hope everyone attends, but when you start have these prove points of quarter in and quarter out. I think it starts to show you the team is delivering and I think the results are now starting to be appreciated and believed. Great. And maybe quickly just on Seahorse, can you just give us an update on how that business is performing relative to your expectations, and how it\\'s plugged in, and where you\\'re seeing maybe the early fruits and some cross-synergy with the existing business? Yes, we just in fact very timely question Ross, we just had our 180 day review this morning and Patrick you want to go ahead and share a couple highlights from that session. Sure absolutely, what I really would like to highlight is how seamlessly the integration of Seahorse went, so we are now at now six months in the integration and we will say the targeting full integration by June which means that you have implemented all of the systems which is a pretty fast pace. At the same time we are seeing the positioning of Seahorse regional portfolio really works out, we see nice deals and combined sales of LCMS and Seahorse and areas like disease research and disease discovery that is actually exactly where we thought it\\'s complementing a lot of strength in metabolomics with the life style metabolism which Seahorse brings today. And this is a very nice story that wasn\\'t really expected well before our customers. Again we on a integration side, we are very pleased with where we stand and we are looking forward to a very successful second half. Yes, Ross I’d add two things. The comment I made to the team this morning this is the fastest I\\'ve seen is doing integration. These things usually plod along for many quarters in some cases for years this one is moving along really, really fast. And we\\'re getting some wins the fact we want an LCMS deal because Seahorse , so it’s the complementary nature the portfolio is starting to work.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Mike, the move you made to creates CrossLab seems to be gaining traction. Can you give us a little background on CrossLab, in terms of who do you think is taking -- it\\'s taking share from somebody at that growth rate. Could you give us more color on CrossLab? Yes, so as you mentioned that was a major strategic move where when we some the company we established as CrossLab group. We had this division about how we could really attack and go after the enterprise wide services and consumers\\' opportunity. And as you see marketing team have really been delivering and we know that customers are responding to the value proposition that Agilent offers both in terms of our service capability is due and that\\'s why I mentioned in my script about the external recognition we recently received.  But they also appreciate the fact we’re able to give them insights in terms of actually helping them improve the business operation and we\\'re seeing a real strong demand for this in the pharma and growing interest in other parts that flag markets. So we know that we\\'re growing faster than some of our competitors in this space. We also know that there\\'s only a few companies really trying to go after this type of business, I believe this is where the market is already going to, and I think you want to be a player here. And I\\'ll leave it to you guys to figure out who\\'s the losing share. But I think, I can tell you as we\\'re growing close to double digit in the space, so that been attractive move for us.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.  Thanks, congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to make sure I understand the variance in the quarter relative to what you were expecting. I believe you had called last quarter for 4% core growth, and we saw 8% this quarter. I hear you, that it sounds like about half of that variance, about 200 basis points, was from the better book backlog to revenue conversion this quarter. And I know you also called out the compare relative to last year. But that compare should have already been known. So I just want to understand what\\'s the other 200 basis points, that really surprised you in the quarter? Sure Tim, again thanks for your comment and I can give you a few dollar numbers of the revenue impact the way we look at it in. And you can do them perhaps the math on the impact on the on the growth rates, but what we saw a relative to our initial expectations for the quarter were really – well first let\\'s start with the market right, so the overall market demand came in as we predicted, we saw good growth across entire portfolio led by pharma improve markets in China as you heard earlier. But I\\'d ask you to look at two things, one is this higher conversion of water to revenue than forecast so base what we’ve done as we reduce the cycle time and by our estimates it happens lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2 the other thing I think you should take a look at is the FX assumptions so around $9 million or so Didier think that’s the number. FX added about another $9 million so between the cycle time improvements the FX assumptions and is the fact of the market continues to get we\\'re getting our fair share of markets where they\\'re growing I think those companies those three facts I think will help you bridge the difference between our guided growth and what actually occurred. Okay. Just a real quick similar question on the margin side. Obviously a little bit of the margin in the quarter was the drop-through, but it looks like you probably did better than you were expecting on an absolute dollar basis on the SG&A, as well. Can you help me understand maybe what is going a little faster there than you anticipated? Yes, I think on the SG&A front I mean we got a couple of our programs inside in the agile are little bit ahead of plan. But Didier if there\\'s anything else -  I will tell you the field structure that we put in place last year. You know it\\'s really stable down I think it\\'s delivering helping us on the growth side and also on the SG&A front as more efficient g to market channel. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, thank you. I had a question on margins, as well. On the gross margin side, I was curious if we should expect maybe another wave of improvement, now that you have the ERP integration done. And on the op margin side, curious how satisfied you are with the sales force realignment, and whether or not there\\'s still more synergies to be had there as well? Yes, a couple of comments here then I’ll hand [ph] that over to Didier in a case like to add a few things here. But in terms of the sales force integration and go to market we couldn\\'t be happier I mean that was a major move made last year where we basically went from five sales force into sales forces one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. As the time I remember sharing with you, hey we\\'re making a big change here and it could affect the top line in the short one that didn\\'t happen. And in fact I submit that as we go out into 2016 and 2017 we\\'re now putting more resources of specialization academia in biopharma, so I think you can see the changes paying off in terms of long term growth. So we\\'re really happy with both the fact that we\\'ve got it all behind us and settle down and think it started to pay off on the initial benefits of in vision when we created that structure.  Relative to gross margin ERP I just keep in mind that what we\\'ve been talking about is a financial systems which really go into the SG&A line so it really won\\'t affect the gross margin. That being said we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in 2016 and 2017. I\\'ll talk a little bit more about in detail next week in New York but as you may know our initial 400 basis points improvement when I came on board we said half a come through OpEx and other operational costs and then others through grow in the growth piece of the a lot of the driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increase volume. So we think we still have room to improve our material cost. And we think that we\\'ve got room to continue to bring down our logistics cost. That\\'s very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up, just to clarify on two topics, one on biopharma, and the other one on the comments you made around China. On biopharma, could you just compare the growth rates you\\'re seeing in the QA/QC setting versus R&D, and then in China, just curious, how much of your improved outlook there is based on the visibility you have with government funding versus end markets that are more on the private industry side? Thank you. I think that on the question – we\\'re not seeing a real significant differences in growth rates across the segment you described in pharma, I do think if you go out a couple years down the road I think we\\'d expect the growth rate in the biopharma be higher than a small molecule with us not that long at all the case right now and you’ve heard earlier from Patrick we expect that to continue through 2017. We\\'re getting more clarity about what\\'s going on in China, I think there was a lot of concerns at one point time on the private sector side of the business, but obviously as you know I think the government drives the market there to a large extent and we\\'re getting more clarity on what\\'s happening in funding so that\\'s why we have increased confidence in our outlook for our business in China.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Hi good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify. Did I hear you correctly, that you said your initial flash for core growth guidance for FY17 was 4.5% at the midpoint? Okay. And so can you like flank that in terms of what you\\'re thinking for the chemical and energy market there? I mean, just what you\\'re expecting in terms of rebound? Could you help us frame that comment a little bit more, in terms of some of the puts and takes. Sure I\\'d be happy to because sometimes you use colorful language it doesn\\'t really give you the insight you need, so let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year we thought our performance would be flat for the entire year. Well in fact it\\'s going to be down, we probably think in the range 2.5%, 3% for the entire year. And that is the change from our assumptions come in this year and that was the assumption be made at the time our initial guidance which makes our revenue results even much more we\\'re really pleased with the results given the fact that the chemical energy market is not develop the way we initially had and thought.  That being said in 2017 we actually will be improved which means it won\\'t be redo it won\\'t be declining and in fact will probably be flat or maybe low single digits and why do we believe that, if you look at how our business breaks down in that segment we often talk about the oil side, but 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration of another 35% has been in the refining the other half which is by far the biggest, I mean biggest individual segment is the chemical side and they\\'re benefiting by lower feedstock costs they\\'ve got pent up investment demands and we\\'re starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact Patrick and I were talking about this morning the kind reminds me of a pharma a few years ago, basically it’s going to have years of shrinking performance in this marketplace. A lot of pent up demand so long story short our growth assumption would actually assumes the low single digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again we still believe we\\'re a surge from the bottom, so it\\'s in still early in the year of 2016 but that\\'s our basic assumption for 207 which is an improved environment, not dramatic, but improved from what we\\'ve seen over the last 24 months.  Just as a quick follow-up on the chemicals comment. You\\'re not worried that some of the activity between Dow and DuPont, and looks like there may be Monsanto and some of these other companies that are dancing around, are you worried that could stymie investment, if you\\'re using the pharma analogy of combinations of those companies, is there some potential headwinds from the chemicals market? Yes, that’s a great question and we looked at this pretty closely when announcement was first made and although Dow and DuPont are very important customers to us that particular deal activity really is immaterial to the total Company’s performance. And then we don\\'t necessary it is the sign of an acceleration M&A and a consolidation is going on in the space. So of course there would be some pause if we would see more of that, but we\\'re not overly concerned about that and I guess the beauty of this business has been just the broad based nature of our customer base or not overly dependent on the one single customer. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, thanks. Mike, can you touch on Japan and things that you saw during the quarter in terms of trends, and maybe what you\\'re looking for at this point on the year? Yes. So Dan, there\\'s a question in and if you know a little bit my history it\\'s been to five years in Japan, so I always been a big support of Japan in terms of a long term view of the market. And I\\'d ask to take a long term view of the market in Japan, so that was the only market that actually went down for us in the second quarter and we are expecting continued some do performance in Japan, so we\\'re not expecting much in terms of improvement in the overall market environment in Japan.  We do think that it could be a market which often will respond to new technologies and innovative new products. So we do hope that we do hold out hope that we could take some share from our new intros coming out in the second part of this year of an overall market perspective, we\\'re expecting remain some dude in our internal forecasts are not are not based on any type of material improvement on our performance in Japan. Okay. Thanks for that color. And you teased some new product introductions in the back half, that should be meaningful to growth. I\\'m sure you don\\'t want to give away any secrets. Could you sort of help us with what part of the business you\\'re anticipating seeing the boost in 2017? Yes, so thanks for the caveat on your question. So what we can point to it great confidence and clarity is the recent introduction we made in analytic. But I would say to you, you will see broad based introduction the cross the entire portfolio and who are growth essential to our business plan as you know I came in last year, we spent a lot of time, we were realizing in our R&D structure and also reallocating where we put money and I think we’re going to start to see some of that starting to pay off as we go into a later part of 2016. So we did want to put a teaser out there and but also just make sure you have confidence in terms what’s behind our view of improved Agilent performance in 2017 second half of this year, but I think you can expect to see is talking about acting to the cross all three business groups. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Shankle of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.  Hi good afternoon. Mike, I want to go back to some of the comments you made, on efforts to tighten cycle times from order to revenue, which seemed to be yielding benefits sooner than expected, particularly in China. Can you provide a bit more background on this effort, and why it was most impactful in China? And then maybe talk about similar efforts under way in other geographies? And relatedly, you positioned these, in answering some questions, as if they were temporary. At least it seems like your guidance doesn\\'t treat these as sustainable improvements, yet everything else you said suggests that these are truly sustainable improvements. So I was just hoping you could help us understand that a little bit better. Yes, sure Doug, I really appreciate the question. And maybe may start with the last part of your question which is the takeaway here we do believe this is a sustainable improvement, so in my mind the language I use this is the new normal in terms of ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this is new normal how we\\'re going operate so how do we get here and why did they look so significantly different in China, so first of all starts with looking at the entire process from an end to end customer perspective from the time of order placement of shipment into custom installation occurs.  And as you know when I restructure the company I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very siloed or an approach to this end to end process from a customer respective, in the company we looked at each slice of the process, but nobody looking at the collective process and then you start doing that and you start seeing where the issues are the opportunities are so we found ways to improve our order linearity, we’ve improved the quality of booked orders and this really gets to your question about China often you\\'re dealing with letters or credit issues and then other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turn them into revenue. We call the delivery box, we\\'ve been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all our shipments so we improve our ability to get in orders in a linear fashion. Make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework. And then we have improved our delivery performance and then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end to end perspective and the result has been a significant improvement in a cycle in orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating and again as I mentioned in my remarks it did create some, it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter but I think we’re delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficient improvement in place so, that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future. Okay. That\\'s really helpful, Mike. But just to be really clear, recognizing these are well-learned sustainable improvements, it\\'s not apparent that this is fully - these improvements, the sustainability is fully reflected in guidance? If that\\'s the case, is that just because you want to see this play out for a couple of quarters before you start baking it in? I think the confusion might be that what we have stated is that this quarter in Q2 we got $20 million to $25 million of revenue that we had anticipated to be recognized in Q3 as a we were bringing all those program to fruition. We had earlier results which is great from where we are now, the order to revenue cycle time is sustainable but we will not see further improvement that will bring Q4 revenue into Q3 or what already is. So the 022 to 25 that’s the one time we’ve got to the level we wanted to be at and from now on it’s just business as usual without any fundamental change in the order to revenue cycle time.  All right. Thanks for that, Didier. Just one last one for you. On the change in Lasergen accounting, was there any dilution in the quarter, and based on the accounting change, should we no longer expect this to be a $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive deal for the year? Yes, correct, you are correct. So, there was no dilution in Q2 and it will not be in a dilution in for the rest of 2016 or 2017 until we exercise our call option and then we will just fully consolidate if we do that obviously - fully consolidate the Lasergen revenue. So that’s a change that, there was a lot of I mean discussions with the auditors, they surprise us a little bit by going to national to get especially some kind of challenge kind of the accounting that we had anticipated locally among the two teams and then we agreed to the recommendation and therefore no dilution to EPS coming from Lasergen in the next two years. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Yes, hi good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe if I could focus on operating margins again for a second. Just help us, remind us, there\\'s a lot going on there, in terms of the programs you have in place and improvements you have going on. Help us, remind us, the bridge between fiscal \\'16 and fiscal \\'17, what gets you to the 22% operating margin? But what I can share with you conceptually is that we will be continuing and completing off the integration of the Darko acquisition. We have a series of operational programs we talked to about one of those already which is the implications of the ERP and the continued focus on gross margin for its specifically material cost reductions in logistics savings. So, I think that combination of those three factors plus with the overall core growth assumption that will currently model around 4.5 get us to the 22. Okay, great. And the strength in the food market, was this all China, or are you seeing strength elsewhere as well? Actually it was both in food market, both in China and in the United States. As you may recall from Q1 announcement this business tends to be little lumpy whereas I think that performance in food market in China has been sustained but we saw a nice rebound in the U.S. in the second quarter. Got you. Okay. And maybe finally, give us your view of the M&A pipeline. We\\'ve seen you do a couple of deals just recently here. Now that you have many of the operational initiatives for the new Agilent in place, should we expect that you\\'re more active with the tuck-ins going forward? Again this is teaser number two, which is we’re going to talk about this little bit more detail on next week but I do feel that the company’s foundation has really firmly established and as I mentioned earlier, I think we’re getting lot better in terms of speed they have to integrate but what I think you inspect to us do still remain disciplined and focus in terms of finding those opportunities that makes sense for us and I would ask you to think about as been complimentary M&A in nature, we’re going to continued to look for those. So, our balance sheet is a huge asset for our shareholders in one which you like to deploy relative to M&A but it has to be the right target. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two clarifications on how you\\'re thinking about the 2016, 2017 progression. The first is actually on the NIH. To what extent, if any, are you anticipating a pickup in the research channel from NIH funding, when we start to see that get disbursed in the second half of the year? And then second, this may be even a longer term question, but how do you think about the evolution of FSMA regulations in the food space in the US? Is it too soon to start getting incrementally optimistic about how they could contribute to the outlook? Thanks. Yes, thanks glad to adjust both of your questions. So on the NIH front I think we talked about the uptick in the sort of our improved confidence about the spends in Academia and Government in the U.S. I think we do think that the NIH stuff will start to flow through to our business. Relative to some in our space we don’t have as a higher percentage of our business tied to the NIH but it will be a positive for us and I think again one more fact pattern which points to continue to - this market will be solid for us as we move into 2017. I think I have to agree with the comment which is - I think it’s always too soon to get overall excited about this from a U.S. spending, I’ve seen this before where legislation is announced and there is a lot of fanfare about it, but we don’t obviously a backed up by investments although we did – we\\'re seeing some looks like some may be more friendly government allocations to this agency unlikely to seem to the EPA. So, we’re not expect anything dramatic to occur differently in the market because of this but if it would that would be clearly good news for us. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Thanks for the question. Mike, on the margins, overall a really good quarter. Then when you look at the margins in DGG and CrossLab, basically flat year-over-year. I guess, is that what you were expecting? Anything that you could call out in the quarter? I know there\\'s some moving pieces in that topline. It’s a great question and the answer is yes, preciously what we had expected one of the obviously - there is from one quarter to next that could be some one time add-ons that adds a little bit of volatility. For example last year both the ACG and DGG had very favorable hedging gains which have gone away for the whole company the hedging gain last year into two was over $7 million and this Q2 was about $1.5 million. And it was mostly in the ACG and DGG and there are other onetime items including regarding the allocation of our shared services among the different businesses which explain but both businesses are on the way to contribute to the operating margin expansion and 22% that we\\'re committing too. Didier we also ask Mark too. We talked about this earlier this last week as well about spending operational efficiency improvements underline were booked to be flat margins that will field back hedging gains other things are actually some real operation stuff. Thanks Mike and Didier. As Didier said, there were several things that were factors in it last year that didn’t come into play this year but we were working on lot of things in terms of improvements, the mixes is somewhat favorable in the context of what we\\'re selling but overall when we look our plans for the first half we are up 70 basis points in the first half over last year. So, our ability to actually due to margin improvements when you pull back and look in the first half regardless of all those things is quite positive. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. Thanks guys. Just had a quick clarification from earlier. So you were talking about the replacement cycle in biopharma and quoted 150,000 LC systems, based on the 1100, 1200 platform. Can you clarify if that\\'s what you think the opportunity is ahead of you, or that\\'s the opportunity in progress? And if so, what - how far are you into that? This is Patrick, let me answer these questions. First and foremost this is not biopharma, this is pharma and biopharma compliance. And when I talk about 150,000 systems out there, it\\'s to installed base of LC systems in all markets. So it\\'s not only in pharma and biopharma, but we think it is the biggest push is actually right now coming from pharma and biopharma. And I would still see we are in the midst of the replacement cycle, and we don\\'t see that to be over in the next couple of quarters. So is a healthy demand and we are in negotiation is a lot of work for our core customers on upcoming replacements and how we place these systems and how we plan it out for them, so it works for them. And Dane if I could add just one other comment to Patrick\\'s response, we\\'ve been focusing a lot in today\\'s call on pharma and biopharma, but you know keep in mind that the replacements like been very, very subdued on the implied market side in the chromatography. So we have several - we have tens of thousands of systems on that side of the house as well. Again this is why we look out in 2017 and 2018 we think that our growth rates are sustainable. On the pharma side probably anything five or six - I think is and my point would be that I think the ball game and this getting started. Maybe in the first inning, we hope to be in the first innings soon that cycle on the implied market side. Thank you. And I\\'m showing no further questions at this time. I\\'d now like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you everybody and I\\'d like to thank you all for joining us today on the call. If you have any questions of course please give us a call in IR and just would hope that we\\'ll see you next week at our Analyst Day in New York City. Thanks again. Bye, bye. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded.

Thank you for joining us on today’s call. I’m pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now, let me highlight three key results. First, Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high-end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high-end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. As for the third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter: the pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remains strong. In the chemical energy market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China’s double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, life science and applied markets group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG’s new products. We’re seeing very strong demand for the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC Systems. The 1260 systems were part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new – two new 7000 Series Triple Quad GCMS analyzers, one for pesticides and another for environmental pollutants. And we continue to strengthen our ICPMS market leadership with a new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICPMS System. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis. Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG’s operating market for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. Portfolio expansion efforts also continued in ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leading in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provides services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent’s portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market. Finally, we saw continued momentum in the diagnostics and genomics group, where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics market. Our pathology business continues on a steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 Companion Diagnostics. Growth in genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our Array CGH, target enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our nucleic acid solutions offering. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. Q3 highlights for DGG include the announcement of an expansion of intended use of our PD-L1 pharma DX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously approved in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer, and in the U.S. with patients with melanoma. We also announced $120 million investment over the next three years to expand production capacity for our nucleic acid solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build a factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid, active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business. Now, I’ll provide an overview of Agilent’s core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw 6th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geography except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. Applied end market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in the environmental market for both instruments and after-market products. This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. Now, I’ll turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward and simplified our Company’s infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the Company’s financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent’s systems infrastructure that would deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. In summary, our multi-year Agile Agilent Program continues to simplify the Company’s business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our cost. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017. On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends, and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth, while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. At our recent May analysts meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model, outgrow the market, expand operating margins, balance capital deployment.  Let’s look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in four years, while increasing adjusted operating margin 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of disynergies from the Company’s split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first three quarters of 2016, the team has delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectation despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns. We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deploy capital in a balanced matter, buying companies that bring new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team, combined with Agilent’s scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. Looking at today’s overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending environment end market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. Against this market drop, we are well positioned to capture growth in these end market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously-raised full-year guidance of 2016 and our longer term goals. Our one Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered higher core revenue growth, operating margin and earnings per share than the high-end of our guidance. Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year’s amount, which gives us increased confidence that we will achieve our previously-raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million, or 1% versus previous guidance, and $7 million, or 0.7% versus last year. It had negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially. Now, to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance: at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year 2015. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation, and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. Hi, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for the time here. I want to start with the one regional trend that seems to be on many people’s minds, which is what is going on in Europe. I wonder if you could speak to the trends that you saw in Europe over the course of the quarter. To some extent, it is a macro question, to some extent, it is research question and of course, there is their UK referendum that’s still out there. So I apologize for the nebulous nature of it. But any color on how Europe progressed over the course of the quarter would be really helpful. Thank you. Yes, sure, I’d be glad to provide some insight there and then I’m going to actually have Patrick jump in on this conversation as well, I think, given your recent travels in the region. But what we saw in the quarter was, obviously, a lot of the big macro events. The Brexit, Turkey, there was a number of develop in the quarter. We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say, though, it is raising an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe and we’ve seen questions around when will budgets be released. So it is more of an uncertainty of question right now. There are people who are just sort of waiting and see how it is going to develop, again no material effect on the third-quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously this influenced us to think about how will Europe develop through the quarter and, Patrick, I know you and I had a pretty deep conversation about this yesterday, so any additional thoughts you would like to add? Yes, thanks, Mike. Talking to our field, local feeder in Europe, you’ll certainly get the feedback there, is some uncertainty, as you said. The Brexit had, with some of the government interviews, no deals had probably some minor impacts. I think what is concerning us here a little bit is also there are a couple of other countries standing on the side lines and have other referendums this year. So we are cautious right now. We’re looking at Europe and the growth in our end for Europe for the remainder of the year and also going into fiscal year 2017. Thanks so much for all that color. And then one bigger-picture question, Mike. You made a pretty significant investment with a pretty long horizon, long-term horizon on this facility in Colorado. So it speaks to your confidence in the long-term outlook for and the scale of the opportunity there. Can you just talk us through how you frame the opportunity, remind us how big that business is today, and how you think about the medium-term drivers that you’re investing in the pursuit of? Thanks so much. Great. So I’m going to handle – you’re quite welcome – I’m going to handle the first part of this question and I’ll turn it over to Jacob and he’ll reassure you about the long-term growth potential, which is the reason I supported the investment. But this is a reminder, this is roughly about 5% or so of EGG’s overall revenues in the range of maybe $60 million plus or so. We still have capacity at the current site, but we’ve got a more demand that we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can’t bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018. And I think as you’ll hear from Jacob, there is a high degree of confidence that the business is going to be there and perhaps you can probably a little context of what exactly is this business, and why we are so confident that the market is going to be there for us. Yes, let me try to provide a little more color there. So first of all, a reminder that the nucleic acid solutions division business out in boulder is providing only go APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with significant potential. These drugs are primarily right now opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there is no treatment and have devastating outcomes and these drugs have actually opportunities to change the expectancy of you could say the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma with these new type of drugs and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize all those performance and consistency combined with our ability to scale in GMP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we’re currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. Well we also see that that will run out – that opportunity is really limited and we’ll run out in a few years from now. And thereby the new investment and the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on to place the site in close proximity into the other [indiscernible] approximately 20 minutes ride away, so we can leverage critical mass highly experienced staff that we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now and it is growing something between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drops – when you get the commercial drop, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies. I know you have one more quarter to go here, but any initial thoughts on the puts and takes you’re saying, how we should be thinking about fiscal 2017? Yes, Jonathan, I would be happy to share my thoughts here. In fact, I perhaps will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks, but we are still seeing ourselves in the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York, I think it was actually two months ago now, I think about it. But our position remains the same. We’re still confident that we’re going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there is really are some new factors that we think support this level of growth. First of all, we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY 2017 on top of what we’ve already introduced this year. We think our customers are going to be really excited about what we’re bringing to market and that’s going to help drive share. So we know we got this MPI pipe gone through the system right now with releases coming up in the several quarters on top of what we’ve done. The second thing we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half – I think it is 52% less when I do the math of Agilent’s revenue, these are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams. And you saw in the our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth and they are not subject to the same types of issues we’re seeing in the capital intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I’d say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma in China market is going to remain significant growth drivers although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we’ve seen in 2016. And as mentioned on our last call, we still expect that the chemical energy market will have bottomed by the end of calendar year 2017. We’re not ready to…. Excuse me, sorry, thanks. Didier, I got my ears confused there. By the end of calendar year 2016, we’re not ready to call bottom, but we do see in 2017 that we’re forecasting that we could be in low single-digits growth in a market we just had 18 to 24 months of pent-up demand for equipment that supports the production process. So those are the three factors that have gone into our thinking as we have thought about the 2017’s growth rate. Honestly, we’ll give you the official guidance at our next call, but I would just reinforce our view today is that we’re still on track to what we told you in May in New York. Okay, that’s helpful. And just one quick follow-up. On the capital equipment business I know you mentioned going into the quarter last time when you gave guidance, you thought there had been a little bit of pull forward and you highlighted why you thought it would be a little weaker. I’m just curious was it in line with what you thought or are there anything unique in the quarter or maybe wasn’t right along the lines of what you thought? Absolutely I think the quarter was actually in line, actually little bit better than we had anticipated coming in the quarter or so. No major surprises in our Q3 results. And as you can imagine, we were delighted with the ability to deliver above our expectations both top and bottom line. Hi. So I just wanted to ask about the LSAG business and some of the moving parts there. And could you maybe just talk about the chromatography markets that a couple of your peers have really have had nice results there. Just what you’re seeing there would be helpful. Yes, absolutely, happy to do so. As Mike mentioned earlier in his remarks, we did receive very strong growth right now in the liquid chromatography business, which has been for the entire year double-digits and that is what we see clearly also taking market share right now. We had a very strong launch of several waves of infinity series starting in 2009 and 2012 and now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in chromatography that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well and it is driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% bankruptcy compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors instrumentations, which makes [indiscernible] very simple and seeing this for our customers. So and we will check this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don’t see yet a lot of momentum. What we see, of course, is we’re getting now into quarters with tougher compare those with double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we’re seeing there is that the core market or one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space and that of course pull some of our results down at this point in time. If the market comes back, we think we are in an exceptional position to pick up this pent-up demand. Yes, when the market comes back, sorry. So I think we are in a great situation there as well. We have an outstanding product portfolio and ability to capture the growth when it comes back. Yes, and the reason why I asked Patrick to segment his remarks in liquid chromatography and for gas chromatography, we have an outsized exposure in gas chromatography and when the relative to the number two competitor in that space where at least two access the number two person. And so when our major market is down, it really hits us. And that is why, again, we’re really quite pleased to be able to deliver the growth we’ve done so far with our number two market actually being down below our initial expectations coming into this year. Yes, that’s really helpful and I appreciate all of the details in the different segments. If I could just follow-up with one more, the Americas growth negative 1% in the quarter. I know it is on a tougher comp relative to last year but could you maybe just talk about the mix of the end markets there and whether there was any other notable changes worth pointing out? Thank you, guys. I think the big one there is the chemical energy markets. So it’s down pretty sharply and I think that’s bringing down the overall numbers as well as our academia and government business was down over last year. So, we think some of that – the way we’re thinking about our plan for the rest of this year, we think the federal money will be there in the fourth quarter for us. Yes. And then in addition if I might add that we had a very strong quarter in Q3 last year in Americas. So it is a tough compare.  Thanks. And maybe first on just on the academic trend because it is a big swing from what you reported last quarter. I understand the Europe dynamic, but frankly what we hear from you it was a little bit different than we heard from most of the other life science peers. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about why you felt more pressure in Europe academic than maybe most of your peers? I think I pointed two factors. I’m not sure exactly what all our peers are saying about Europe. I think they’re probably saying the same thing, which are the European budgets are constrained and funding has not been released and is actually withheld in some situations. I also think you may be hearing more positive spin on the U.S. environment because of many of our competitors have much more business coming from NIH. So there is a lot of positive view of the NIH budget but we pick up a relatively small piece of that overall budget. The agencies where we do a lot of our business in the U.S. government, we know the money is coming in the fourth quarter. Anything else you’d add to that, Patrick? I think the biggest dynamic there is a sub segment within environmental as well where we pick up our forensics business and we report externally just a point on environmental business, but a lot of big deal activity in forensic. So, last year, we had a lot of big deals at this point in time. Our environmental market is big deals in the second quarter. So it is really a forensics-driven phenomena which is where we didn’t have as many big deals in the third quarter and, you know, this business tends to be a little bit more lumpy than our base environmental business. Okay. And then last one, little bit of an esoteric question, but on the PD-L1 datasets in front-line alone, can you maybe just talk about whether there is kind of any change in your outlook. Obviously, we’re tempted to go without a companion of sales markets doing a companion too. So, can you talk about whether some of those developments have changed your view of the market opportunity overall. Sure, Tycho, in fact we just had a conversation on this yesterday. So, Pat, I mean Jacob, do you want to share latest thoughts from Agilent on this topic? Yes, I say, first and foremost, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen over the PD-L1 over the last 10 months and we continue to see strong traction. You’re right there has been some announcements recently on some studies that has not come out as expected. It really supports our thesis about the importance of CDX and really that you need to make sure you stratified your patient group give the right way. So, clearly, there is a short-term opportunity at least from one of our customers that is little less than we hope for, but I don’t think that that overall change really the thesis and we continue to see a big opportunity here. Hi, good afternoon, guys. So it seems like most of the confusion we’re hearing is sort of on the sequential progression of core revenues. And so, I look at over the last two years, it looks like sequentially the comp is roughly, I don’t know, 200 basis points easier on core. It looks like you have a little bit heavier of an NMR headwind in 4Q than you did in 3Q. So one can you confirm that? And then, two, as we just think about the crosswalk, what are the other sort of underlying assumptions in terms of what is different sequentially versus 3Q, whether it is end markets or any of the key segments, and then where have you built in, I guess, some conservatism or some of that uncertainty. Thanks for the question, Ross, and why don’t I go ahead and just share with some thoughts about the Q4 guidance and Didier, maybe you can dig into your notes on the NMR impact. But I think it is important for me to share with the audience here today how we thought about our Q4 guidance. I think This may get to the root of some of your questions. As you heard on the call, first of all, we’re quite pleased with higher than guided core revenue growth that we delivered in Q3 after having raised last, in last call, and I think we’ve got this increased confidence to achieve our previously raised core growth guidance for the year. And, listen, we realize by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise, but the way we looked at it, we said, listen, there is a raised level of uncertainty in the market centered around Europe. And, you know, we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We have seen some, you know, downward revisions in terms of market overall economics forecast for Europe. So we’re really not sure exactly how that’s going to develop. So we just thought it is prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising again the full-year guidance. So that is how we thought about the process. We really didn’t look over the years sequentially. We do know that last year, though I said I don’t like the tough compare, but we did have a blowout fourth quarter last year, but anything else, Didier, you can remember unusual… You pointed out really what we intended to do is maintain the overall core revenue growth for the whole year and that’s how we derived Q4. We’d raise last quarter, and business is developing in the third quarter actually better than we had thought as you saw in our results. If you look in the fourth quarter, listen, we don’t know how this Europe is going to play out, so let’s just be cautious as opposed to raising again for the quarter. So that makes total sense to me, Mike. I mean, I think given some the uncertainty, certainly I don’t want to get in front of your skis and you guys have been beating numbers so that’s good. I guess as you think about the key product cycles for the business, how do you think about the cadence now that you’ve had some releases of when we could start seeing that, also draw up the core growth overall. And then, secondarily, when do we start to, you know, comp through, you know, we’ve now I guess comped through some easier compares, you know, on the diagnostics business which has been going hot for, I don’t know, four or six quarters now. How long do you think we’ve got left on that trajectory of sort of high single to almost double-digit growth in that business. Thank you. I think there for the foreseeable future, we’re highly confident on the growth rates in this business and that’s why I made the comment earlier about, hey, when you think about Agilent long-term growth perspective, you think about 17, think about that we have got over half of our revenue in markets that are going to have a steady trajectory of growth. And you heard Jacob talk about what is going on in the companion diagnostic PD-L1. That is why I wanted to highlight the investments we are making in NASD which is a part of the business we haven’t really talked a lot about with you.  So I think it is a lot of Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing, there’s a lot of fundamental very attractive markets. We have a strong position and so Jacob, I don’t want to necessarily speak for you but I guess I have, we expect this growth rate will be sustained. Anything else you want to add to my story? You’re absolutely right. And I’m definitely pleased with the excellent growth last quarter, we had 5%. So I really want to make sure that – you saw that we were – when we talked also at the Analyst Day we believed the right direction is 6 or 7 and I’m happy to beat that. But we do not see any change in trajectory right now and we’ll continue in those high single-digit growth rates going forward. And Ross, I think perhaps earlier question was around product cycle replace. Yes, so I think as you may know, when I came into the role little over a year and a half ago, we had really spent a lot of time, redirecting our R&D programs, we’ve restructured the company, we reorganized our R&D programs. And I think you’re starting to see the cadence. So you’ve seen some of the products come out. We highlighted earlier on the chromatography side, some updates, and new products around spectroscopy, ICP-MS, we know this cadence is going to continue throughout the next quarter and into 2017. So that is why when I got the earlier question about, hey, what are you thinking about in terms of 2017? I know what is in our road maps and I know what is coming to the market over the next 12 months and I know what has already come to the market and I know how customers are responding. That’s why we have this level of confidence about our ability to continue to grow this company in what has been barely mixed market conditions to say the least. My first question, I guess both are going to be on guidance. So for fiscal Q4 your guidance essentially tells us that you’re assuming operating margin declines year-over-year in fiscal Q4 and despite of what seems like could be a, I guess, mixwise a pretty favorable quarter year-over-year, based on your commentary. So, keeping that in mind and the fact that you’ve actually expanded operating margin year-over-year I believe six straight quarters, can you just explain why this makes sense? I think you’ve got the string of consecutive quarters, the six quarters in a row and Didier, we looked at this, I think it is purely volume related but… Yes, absolutely. As same thing for operating margin approach as for revenue approach, we wanted to maintain full year operating margin because obviously it is linked to revenue, so we maintain our core revenue growth assumption of 4.5% and our operating margin assumption of 20.4%. Now you are absolutely correct that that would mean that 50 basis points reduction from the significant operating margin we had in Q4 of last year of 21.5%, it is still a significant 70 basis points sequential improvement and you have to take into account, as Mike said that, this is based on only 1.2% of top line growth. So, a slight reduction in operating margin still very significant increase sequentially but slight reduction related to the one, the assumption that we’d made on the top line growth of only 1.2%. Yes. So I guess that is a segue to yes, I guess the second guidance question. And I don’t mean to be redundant here, because there has been a lot of questions on this already, but I’m going to ask anyway. I mean your guidance is for around 1.2% core revenue growth in the quarter. If we think about this by end market you actually have an easier compare in environmental forensics, academic government, and food relative to certainly what you had in fiscal Q3. Diagnostics is a little tougher but you have some real momentum there. So if we just kind of to make it simple assume all those end markets grow 3% to 5% and net chemical and energy is down mid-singles it would imply that you guys are thinking pharma is only going to grow low-single digits maybe at best in Q4. It is a tough compare in pharma in the quarter. But you’ve talked about continued strength in pharma in fiscal 2017 in response to an earlier question. Again recognizing the uncertainty you talked about in Europe, this is I guess some of this is hard to reconcile and can you help out a little bit and specifically again what are you assuming for pharma in the quarter, is that because of the compare and what is your assumption for Europe growth in the quarter. Yes, sure. Glad to walk you through this Doug. In fact we spent a lot of time modeling our end market views for the rest of the year anticipating this might be a question that would arise. And as I recalled, Didier, I think that we had a less optimistic view relative to academia and government than I think Doug’s math was – where we were seeing, we’re concerned about Europe. And we had – we basically had a flat for the year and I think we still have pharma in double digits. If you are going to just may be a little walk-through. Yes, maybe – I mean again considering how we explained how we came up with the Q4 guidance, the makeup of the Q4 guidance by market is we are assuming that academic and government and chemical and energy will show the same core revenue growth reduction year-over-year as in Q3. So minus 5% for academic and government, minus 4% for chemical and energy. So the assumption is no change between Q3 and Q4. And then for the [indiscernible] pharma you mentioned pharma we are assuming mid-single-digit. And again on a very tough compare and to in line with the way we have been very conservative on the… Yes. As we thought about the company coming in, I think we thought that the pharma growth would be lower. We thought China would be lower and we thought chemical and energy would be higher. In fact what’s happened is pharma has actually been stronger and China is stronger than initially forecasting and you know the story on chemical and energy. Okay. Only thing I don’t think we got there and maybe I missed it, but what is the assumption for Europe in the quarter?  Hey, this is for Didier. It seems like cash flow is something that’s going better than expectations, better than our expectations at least. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the remaining levers that you have to pull on that as you go into 2017. Do you think free cash flow growth in 2017 is really just going to be a matter of earnings growth or is there more that you can do there to improve free cash flow faster than earnings? Yes, there is more that we can do. Certainly the profit before tax is going to be a factor, but Henrik, who heads the Order Fulfillment and Supply Chain organization has also committed to a material decrease in inventories. So that is also something that we’re counting on that will help us continue expanding our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue or a percentage of profit. Okay. And then a quick one going back to one of Tyco’s questions on the forensics end market, of that 12% slice of pie that’s environmental and forensics. Would you be willing to tell us how much is forensics. I don’t think we disclosed that. It is fairly small but enough to move it directly when big deals happen. Yes, thanks. Just had a question on margins and then a follow-up on Europe. On the margin side, thanks, on the margin side, if I look at sort of the components of gross margin, its interesting the LSAG division is your highest gross margin segment in most quarters, but that was one where you saw little pressure. So can you help us think a little bit about kind of the key initiatives you guys have under the hood there to continue to driving better gross margin versus expectations and the same goes for SG&A? Yes, over the last 12 months or 18 months you guys talked a lot about some of the things you’re doing to drive gross margin higher. This particular quarter you had a little weakness in your most profitable segment. So I’m wondering kind of aside from just the top line contribution what you guys were able to achieve this quarter on the gross margin line that allowed you to put up a slightly better result. Great, great. Thanks for the question. So what we’ve been focusing on really are three dimensions around what we call our value engineering program, our logistics model, and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in 2016, the program that Henrik is driving across the company, I think we have probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model, and you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015 that’s no longer the case. In fact we benchmarked ourselves and we got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other two elements of the program or have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering, when you’re re-engineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance, but at lower cost. And then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of that, I think those latter two parts of the program will carry us forward into 2017 and 2018 beyond. So I think that’s how we’re really working the gross margin side. And by the way – whether our comments were focused on LSAG, a lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DGG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in the New York, and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we are now in one SAP instance simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the pharma Dako company into the Agilent environment.  In 2017, where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have improved customer experience there. So there is a couple of big initiatives as well as we’re looking at other aspects of our benefit structure as we made some changes as you may know earlier, for U.S. pension plan, and the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is alive and we have lot of initiatives under way to ensure that we can continue to take cost out by simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that? I would just mention the currency hedging. It had a big impact, it will have a big impact on a year-over-year basis. It is all impacts to gross margin and ACG and DGG, because of their footprint have been more penalized. So ACG on the year-over-year basis lost $6 million on gross margin just because of the hedging programs, and DGG $2 million. So that also explains the difference between ACG, DGG and LSAG. LSAG has a different footprint obviously with a stronger presence in Europe, for example, and so that can be starts a little bit the percentages. That is helpful. Thank you. Just follow up on Europe. I want to make sure, I understand kind of how what you are seeing [indiscernible] to the guidance. And so two items there, one is did the weakness in Europe, did that pick up in the month of July, just given you guys were off calendar versus the peer group. And Secondly, does your guidance assume the academic end market in Europe weakens further as the year progresses or that it sort of stabilizes from here? So nothing unusual in July. And I think the assumption for Q4 is basically a continuation not only worse, but not any better. And we just thought that was a prudent way to think about the Company’s performance for the fourth quarter. I would love to be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong, but we thought from a planning and guidance standpoint we should be prudent in terms of how we looked at the European market overall. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your question please. I’m well, sir, thank you. So a lot of the revenue questions have been asked and, I mean, certainly seems prudent to me, you know, your guidance just given that Europe even in a good year the counter through quarter is always a little bit choppy, anyway there’s clearly some heightments [ph] during this year. So I think it is prudent to be a little bit conservative. But could you just talk a little bit about some of the – I know the share count was a little bit higher this quarter than what you previously guided to are you still looking at buying back 1% of the outstanding share going in to the – going forward. Yes, why don’t you talk about the share repurchase activity in the quarter and how we’re thinking about it going forward, Didier? We filed it back in November 20, I think of last year, the 10b5-1 on an annual basis and we intend to file a new one to register new one also in November of this year. And it is a formula-based instructions that we have provided, you know, between buying 350,000 shares a day under certain conditions to buying zero kind of I think with a cap as you can imagine. So we don’t know exactly how it’s going to play out in Q4, and the only thing that we know is that if there is any kind of shortfall at all in our intended buying in Q4 because of the formula, in the 10b5-1, it will all be carried over into the following year. So we intend to spend exactly what we committed to spend. Great. That’s really helpful. And could you just give us a metric on, you know, what instruments versus consumable growth was in the quarter? I think perhaps the best way to think about it is just look at the respective business groups. You had the LSAG results of down to, and then… Minus 2, plus 8 and that’s why I – as you think about 17 for the Company, if you really want to look at the growth rates of those two business units in the recurring revenue space, ACG and DGG perhaps differently than you might think about how you model the risk profile for revenue projections for the instrument side of the company. Great. That’s really helpful. And I guess could you – when you sort of – you’re still feeling good about the margin target for 2017 and it sounds like that you’re IT initiatives are well under way or finished to do like that. If you still feel confident about getting what you’re expecting for next year for the margin improvement? Absolutely. So that is why I made the statement earlier, because as we said, if we can be in that, you know, 4.5% and 5% kind of growth range, perhaps [indiscernible] it makes at a little bit more challenging but we see the path to 22 is not just around margins – excuse me – not just around margin improvement from volume, but there are specific real programs, something we review once a month and we have active programs and the cost will continue to come out in some of these big programs. Actually I must say I’m really pleased with the team because we went through and did the what we call project NUNU is the finance program we just finished up. And then right on the heels of that we’re going to go live in early 2017 with integration of Dako. So the teams are still energized and working hard and I think it is going to have a material impact on our results in 2017 and that’s why we have confidence about assuming no major change in terms of the macro environment that we can reach what we think are pretty challenging goals but we have a path to get there. Thanks for the question. Patrick, just going back to your comments on share gains and LC, I know you guys don’t like to get too specific on winners and losers but as was mentioned it does look like all the major players are doing fairly well there. So who would you say you’re taking share from is it the small column providers, or does that actually extends to some of the box companies as well. Thank you. Thanks for the question. I can give you only a general flavor here on what we think is going on in the market, I will not comment on the individual competitors but your assumption that the smaller suppliers probably take a larger hit is also our observation. Okay. And then maybe a specific one on C&E, Mike at the Analyst Day you called out, a Saudi Arabian refinery build out that was getting going. Have you started to see some demand there and is that something that you think contributes all to the back half of the year. The major projects that are under way haven’t been cancelled. So but what we’re not seeing any major new projects under way. There is a lot of – there is actually a lot of positive news by a lot of studies about where this market is going, but we’re not seeing – what we’re – just to clarify here. The major project we knew about, whether it be the one I mentioned in Saudi, or there is a major project down in Texas, these programs they’re going to come on line. So people aren’t canceling capacity increased projects, but we’re not seeing a lot of new – new projects, and that’s why we have taken a fairly conservative – probably a pragmatic view of that marketplace. I would like to reminder everybody to, that when we talk about chemical energy over 50% or so is actually chemicals, chemical processing, not directly tied to the exploration of production of oil. Hey, Mike, I guess specifically what is the GC business doing? What is its growth rate? What was it doing in the July quarter? And what is the backlog and what is July or August look like, I guess? Thanks, Paul, I appreciate the question. And as you probably will understand, I’ll give you a more high level resolve because we don’t actually comment specifically at a product category level. Beyond I think, I would just reemphasize the point that Patrick made when he characterized chromatography market, that business is down relative to last year, because of the chemical energy market is down. And we have seen no – no movement at all downward pressure on our share position. It is really a market phenomenon we’re dealing with right now and that’s why when that we place a market does turn we’ve been through these cycles before, when it does turn we will be in a strong position to capture that growth as given the strength of our position in that market which right now happens to be down. And then last on the Applied Markets and in a broader sense, do you think it’s still a GDP growth rate normalized or what do you think the Applied Markets should be for Agilent? We actually don’t think about it that way because the segments that – the segments of the market, like your food and environmental testing, we think are independent to some extent of GDP. So the only way we think about that is relative to it is our chemical energy space. So if you could just kind of think about tying GDP to that sub segment of the company, I think that would be a good place to start but I would not apply it to the whole of the Applied Markets because these are being driven by quality of life investments in the food and environmental area. And I think that’s why – I think this composition of our end markets is the reason why we have been able to put up these kind of growth rates even when our number two market as a company has shrunk this year. And then last on – you had your Analysts Day obviously you’ve been talking about a 22% operating margin. Are you more or less confident that number for FY17 at this juncture? Yes, I think the confidence level is the same as it was back in May, and again I maybe just share a few points here which are we have this confidence of delivery on that given our belief that we can get that growth rate that we\\'re putting the growth rates right now in that territory. We got this pipeline of new products coming out. We have got this nice recurring revenue stream with ACG and DGG that will carry this momentum into 2017. And that we’re interim business going – pharma still looks good. Of course you have these double-digit compare issues. China continues to be strong. Chemical energy has got to turn at some point in time because the market requires these tools to support production. Our thinking is when you look at chemical energy is – we know our customers are looking for productivity improvements to help improve their company profitability. We think that’s a value proposition that Agilent has. We think as they go through their budget justification processes in that budget start and in calendar 2017, that this is why we can say hi listen the decline in this business after 18 months or 24 months will start to turn, and we could see low-single digits by the end of 2017 for the chemical energy market. If that happens, which we believe it will, that will give us the confidence to get the growth and we\\'ll get the margin given both the volume, but also in terms of gross margin improvement initiatives as well as our SG&A cost. Thank you. And our final question today comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Your question please. Hi guys and thanks for the questions. We\\'ve heard a lot of commentary from your peers on Japan, strong pharma environment, weak academic government. So I was wondering if you could walk through your exposure by end market there and what you\\'re seeing across those customer groups. 5%. Yes, just to give you a sense of 5% of the total market. Historically, we’ve been stronger and I can share this from my experience having been the country manager for Japan for a few years in early part of my career. We tend to be much stronger in the chemical and energy segment of that marketplace. We\\'re doing well in the life science research and genomics, but majority of the business sits in the chemical energy space, which has been down. I think Japan is part of that story. Pharma, the pharma business for us is a relatively smaller portion of the market for us. I think they\\'re doing well in pharma but not enough to really drive significant overall growth rates for Japan. Okay, great. And then any color on the progress of Dako integration, what\\'s left to do there, got a nice up margin expansion in DGG this quarter. So are you still thinking that 20% in fiscal 2017, or could there be upside to that number? Jacob has to be sitting by next to me in this conference room. I don\\'t think he\\'s ready to sign up for more than 20% because it is quite an improvement from where we started, but I think he remains quite confident in the 20% achievement of that goal of OM perspective. You saw we had 18.8% operating margin this quarter, up 200 basis points over last year. And the big next wave of integration efforts really will be starting in our Q1 2017. So we have a major program we call it project de Gaulle. We seem to like probably French names, Didier, I\\'m not sure why that may be the case. But and that really will be the next big step to move these pharma Dako company into the Agilent environment. And it will take a little bit of while to get the cost out, but as you go, as you think about exiting 2017, you didn’t have a much lower SG&A spend than you started the year and. Jacob, why don’t you share anything else. No, I think you said it correctly. I just want to reinforce what you said, the cost of 20% – at delivering 20% in 2017 is an in – a significant turnaround of where we were a few years ago. So right now that’s our full aim and I\\'m very happy where the team is and excluding this right now. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I would like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Thank you, Jonathan, and on behalf of the entire management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions please give us call at IR. Thanks, again. Bye-bye. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

I am very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above market growth, revenues of 1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizable 41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeds our expectation. Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. Turning to our full year results, core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%, we increased our operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results show a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. We\\'re capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. In the past year we distributed a $150 million in cash dividend, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested 480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. Let me now address what\\'s happened in our end markets and business group. I\\'ll start with the end markets, our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth has been driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government\\'s decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected while U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. Critical diagnostics grew 8% over last year led by continued growth in reagents. Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market up 3%. Chemical energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017 with no significant downward or upward movements. Geographically, Asia lead by China and Europe was stronger than forecast. Our Asia business excluding Japan grew double-digit driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged we delivered solid mid single-digit growth; European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding were stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical-energy market weakness and specific to the U.S. low U.S. government funding. Moving onto the business groups, life science and applied markets group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. And expected revenues from our analytical lab instrument business, was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new line up of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at pharma and applied food, environmental and forensic markets. LSAG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 22.8% up 280 basis points from a year ago. We\\'re building for the future; in August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on a recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users performed gas chromatography. Industry experts recognized the unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo was featured this month on the cover of LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. Customer response is also very positive to this introduction confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptick in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017 with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters. Another industry unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICPMS System which we just introduced in Q3 has also been well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in lab to demand the highest standard of performance. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver strong sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 22.7% down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations. ACG was also driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our cross lab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratory supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services as customers focus on keeping their order instruments operational. We are investing for the future in ACG, we just introduced a new range that innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab Manager\\'s. Last, but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the diagnostic Genomics Group continued with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improvement previous acquired Dako business is paying off. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates with strong and strengthen reagents and companion diagnostics. Our new clinic asset solutions business for which we recently announced a significant production capacity grew double digit. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligo and nucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DGG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 19.6% up 40 basis points from the year ago. In October, there was some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck\\'s Keytruda is now approved by the FDA for first line treatment from metastatic non-small cell lung cancers of patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent\\'s pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanding use. This is the first time in Agilent\\'s PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first line testing. The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DGG. We launched the comprehensive offering of poor crystal libraries for functional genomics. This was held accelerate research in the complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent\\'s SureSelect. Solutions, and we broke background initiated construction on the announced our $120 million investments in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity. Turning now to operating margin, we remained focus on operating margins improvements. Since the Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered seven consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first two years of the Company\\'s transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of synergy cost due the spinoff of key site. On the operations front our Agile Agilent Program continues to simplify the Company and lower operating cost. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improved our interactions with customers and lowered our costs. It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. In the coming year, we\\'ve realized cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost savings initiatives. Turning to our fiscal year 2017 marketing and company outlook. As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for a superior earnings growth is throughout go to market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go to the specifics of our Q1 2017 and full year guidance; I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy given the environment of increased uncertainty. This is a change since our last call and the May 2016 Analyst and Investor day. In our end-markets, we expect continued strength in Pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the Food, Environmental, and Clinical Research and Diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty around European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the U.S., with U.S. government policies and spending, and Chemical and Energy markets being the wild cards. Chemical and Energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices, has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued Academic and Government research market in the coming year, until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency valuation discussions could impact our business. We finished fiscal 2016 very strongly, and we are well-positioned for future growth with a rich pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see more clarity on U.S. and European government actions, and have better indicators of when we will return to growth in our industrial end-markets. Predicting end-market growth in today’s uncertain political and economic environment is challenging; however, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market, whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthens us well for the coming year and beyond. The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor day is in full force. The new leadership team -- put in place in early 2015 continues to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. We have improved our adjusting operating margins by 280 basis points over the past two years -- and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017. However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor day meeting, changes in exchange rates, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5 percent. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have internal action plans aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team’s compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance expectations than reflected in our initial full-year earnings guidance. As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We are improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing systems, making the Company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margins. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year performance, both well over the high-end of our guidance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9% respectively, and our OM, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 bps and 110 bps respectively. Our full year EPS, at $1.98, is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage point, which had a 2 cents impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year at $793 million reflects our strong overall performance. Turning to capital returns, for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. I will now turn to the guidance for Fiscal Year 2017 As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year 17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0 % to 4.5%. It is based on October 31st exchange rates and currency has a 0.6% negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year 17 adjusted operation margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year 17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. As you update your models for fiscal year 17, please consider the following 10 points. First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. As we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Four, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Six, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seven, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eight, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Nine, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million, 5 million less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year 16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year 16, mostly due to the investment in a second nucleic acid facility. Now, finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year, versus Q2 last year, meaning about $15 million of revenues shifting from Q1 to Q2. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis, and EPS will grow 7%. As customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front-loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. First question from me is, I wonder if you could just juxtapose your results against from what we\\'ve heard from others in the category over the last several weeks? Sounds like a particularly strong category by a number of -- quarter by a number of metrics. You actually accelerated where we saw a number of others decelerate in terms of organic growth in the quarter. Can you give us from a high level what you think are the keys there in terms of positioning, why it is the quarter was so good for you guys relative to the market? Thanks, Steve. The headline for me was as we looked throughout the quarter, we were winning more business than we planned. So, we win a lot of business in our core market. I think some of the end markets strengths that we planned to was actually a fairly similar to what I\\'ve seen other people comment on relative to the strength of China, strength of pharma continued, subdued, but kind of a stable actually even in government environment. And for us, I think we were just delighted by our performance in particular in our analytical instrument business where we seemed to be winning more business than we planned, and that we think that those well for the strength of our portfolio and so other things we\\'ve been doing over the last year in our channels as well. And then so the follow-up I guess just to dig a little deeper would be did you notice anything in terms instrument trends relative to consumable trends accelerating a decelerating and what is that telling you about end of calendar year budget flash. Thank so much. Yes, we were talking a bit about this yesterday with the team. And if you look at our performance to the quarter, we got off to a strong start in August and continued throughout the quarter. And sometime it\\'s hard to tell other first month where things are lamped for the quarter. But I\\'d say by the end of September, we knew we are letting more business than we planned. There is really shaping up to be strong quarter for us and really position us well for us going into 2017. Mike, just hoping for a little bit more color on some of the expectations in guidance particularly in pharma. Are you still assuming that\\'s kind of double-digit growth next year or are you factoring in a moderation? And on environment you\\'ve managed to grow that business in contrast what we saw from one of your peers last week. So may be talk a little bit about you know contribution from the GC replacement type for next year as well? Yes, sure. You broke up a bit on the call so, if I don\\'t get to the specific questions, please come back to me. But I think relative to the expectations for end market kind of thinking for growth rate, we had pharma below the double-digit growth in place in 2016. So, as we look at our end markets we would expect a moderation of growth, not because the spends are going to go away, but you\\'re really going to start to get into tough comparisons and Didier, if I remember correctly, we were in the mid to high single digit growth for pharma. So in environmental the story really there is China, and we think that\\'s got many quarters in front of us of growth in China. As you know, I\\'m fairly bullish on the prospect of that market and I think we got kind of a perfect storm here going on where we have strong products going into growing markets. Relative to the GC replacement cycle, this is really about what\\'s going to happen in the chemical and energy market, and I\\'ll make a few comments here, then Patrick you may want to provide your perspective as well. So you may have noticed in my call script I went kind of out of my way to talk about a measured ramp-up of our new GC because we think we\\'ve got a winner product on our hands. We know there\\'s a lot of interest from customers but we also recognize the reality of constraints they may have in their capital budgets. I know they\\'re working with their own management teams internally withs these companies about what they may get in terms of funding in 2017. What are your thoughts, Patrick, on that as well? Thanks, Mike. Looking at the GC market, we definitely are positioned very well to capture any growth opportunity there. We have launched Intuvo which is a strong message to our customers that we are standing behind them when it comes to drive for lower cost of management, when it comes to lower cost of ownership, when it comes to increased productivity. And it positions us clearly as the market leader in gas chromatography where we had discussions overtime not only in Intuvo, but I think what in Intuvo launched it for us, it also spread the lot of discussion again about of other part of portfolio to 70 to 90 and other products which are market leading products. And again, the discussion with the customers in the suppressed market is all about, how can we help them increasing their productivity, driving their cost analysis down. And this is where we are exceptionally well positioned to this portfolio. Yes, maybe just to put an exclamation point on this is that we know that the installed base is that historic levels of ageing. We know the equipments being used and it\\'s just the matter of time for that replacement cycle is going to turn on, but as you saw in my call comments, we\\'re not ready to call that yet. Okay. And then just as one clarification on the operating margin guidance half of the cut your down by 1% from where you talked about the Analyst Day half that is for my lab tension at FX. Is that rest just conservatism even kind of the macro? Yes, with the high end is at 21.5 and we are losing about 50 basis points related to the three items that\\'s we had mentioned currently acquisition and pension expenses. And the other thing that to note is as Mike has clearly stated that we have fielding measured on achieving 22% in terms of our variable conversation. Yes, in the way Didier talked about this one was listen, we think we got to pass to 22, but there is lot higher risk than there was back at the last call and at the May AID. So, we thought it was prudent for us to guide this way, but we rollout inside while our comp is tied to the 22% number. Hi, guys. This is Luke Lynch for Ross. Just hoping you could give a little more color on your margin assumptions for next year. What you guys are thinking about pacing the FX headwinds, if any, what\\'s going to be operational, what\\'s pricing, et cetera? I think the question, Didier, was relative to the composition of our operating margin improvements for next year and perhaps we can start with the mix between volume and OpEx and gross margins. Yes, I mean, I\\'m not going to give you the full bridge. When we provided the guidance of 21% to 21.5%, we took into account obviously all the impacts that I\\'ve mentioned. So there is, -- it\\'s based on 4.3% core revenue growth. There is clearly an operating leverage impact and a lot of actions that are taking place to offset inflation and other headwinds that probably I have mentioned. The guidance assumes some level of increased improvement in gross margins as well as a reduction in terms of the OpEx as a percentage of revenue. So you have pretty much on all fronts some improvements, not as much as we had initially anticipated because of the three headwinds that I mentioned. Some of it related to operating leverage and some of it related to the continuation of our Agile Agilent Program. And maybe reminding the audience, Didier, when we first started this march almost two years ago to go to the 22%, we laid out a path which is really around 60% being volume, the other 40% was going to be on OpEx improvements and gross margin. I think we\\'re thinking about the same kind of mix for 2017. Great. And I guess just one more. You guys did really well on the cash flow in 2016. I think 647. You\\'re guiding for 625. Is there any timing impact on that 2017 guide and then I guess on the tax of 2017 what are you baking into that benefit down there? So, I assume when you refer to timing impact, you\\'re referring to special I mean between 2016 and 2017, some cash outlays or inlays that could -- Yes, there\\'s a little bit. Let me just highlight two potentially. In fiscal year 2016, we disbursed $66 million for overall Agilent variable pay and pay for results. Next year we -- but we\\'ve changed our program so that we now do a lot of the cash outlays on an annual basis instead of semi-annual. We had the full brunt in 2017 of improvements in 2016 and the fact that we\\'re going to pay in 2017 something that is more than pertains to 2016. So it\\'s going to be $91 million going from 66 to 91 so an increased capital cash outlay. And then second we did not fund our U.S. pension plan in 2016 so our overall contributions to our worldwide pension plan was $24 million. We intend to fund our U.S. pension plan more in 2017 and contributions to the pension plan will move to 45, so an increase from 24 to 45. So those are the two things that come to mind in terms of explaining some of the variance between 2016 and 2017. Even with those two headwinds we are still showing in our initial guidance a nice increase of $30 million on year-over-year basis. And your second question? Yes, the tax rates, I -did mention at the May Analyst Day that we were going to work really hard on the reducing our tax rate by 2 percentage points over the course of next two to three years. We\\'re very happy to be able to deliver already 1 percentage point in this fiscal year \\'16. We still aiming to reduce our effective tax rate by about 1 percentage point over the course of next 24 months, as committed to -- or indicated I would say in fiscal year -- in the AID but it\\'s prudent to assume that the reduction will come in fiscal year \\'18 and not in fiscal year \\'17. So, in your models, we advise you to put a 1 percentage point reduction in tax rate from \\'19 to \\'18, in fiscal year \\'18, not in fiscal year \\'17. Hi, this is Ryan Blicker on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Would you be willing to provide what your LTMS growth was in the quarter and how that was impacted by the comparison relative to recent quarters and maybe what your annual growth was there? What I can tell you is that back to my earlier statement is we\\'re winning more business than planned. So we\\'re quite pleased with how we\\'ve been doing with the LCMS portfolio and Patrick you may want to remind the audience some of the new stuff that we\\'ve come out with. So, I guess I\\'m not comfortable with giving the specifics of the growth rate, but just give you a sense of trend of the business and maybe a few proof points why we believe as it\\'s going as well as it is. Sure. Again, we are confident that we are outgrowing the market on many fronts. We have a very strong LTMS portfolio. We launched a lot of exciting products at ASMS this year. I think the reception in the market just underlines our strength. The combination of LC and LCMS is important and then we think both are wining platforms. We see strong adoption across all the end markets. If there was one market where we have seen some headwind, then it was probably the pain management market segment, but that is also in line with what\\'s probably have heard from some of our competitors, but overall, we have been very pleased with the result in Q4. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, it seems like there could be a repatriation holiday of some sort in 2017. I believe over 90% of your cash is currently trapped internationally. Can you provide any initial thoughts on how you would prioritize repatriated cash specifically on M&A opportunities and returning capital to shareholders? Thank you. Sure, Ryan. Didier, how about I make a few initial comments and if you want to add anything to it. But first I think we also need to put a series of caveats on my response because we really don\\'t know what this might look like, what strings might be attached to how you can use it, whether you can use cash in a certain way. But, obviously, we would welcome this type of development including a move to a more permanent reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates. That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, we assume with those caveats, I think what you\\'d expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we\\'re managing our current use of capital. So, we would want to use it for U.S. based M&A and we\\'d like to use that in situations where we\\'ve been using debt, such as our share repurchases. So we would be able to finance our share repurchases and then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we\\'d want to do is first of all understand what are the restriction that\\'s could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain. If that particular situation would develop we would bring it back and use the cash very much along the lines of how we\\'ve been using cash with the exception is I won\\'t need to borrow money like I\\'ve done in the past for U.S. based M&A or stock repurchases. I guess you must be okay with that, Didier. You haven\\'t said anything else. Thanks. Mike, so, I was just going back and looking. You did 6% growth organically last year, 6% this year in 2016. Just at a high level, you had some pretty tough businesses in some of the industrial businesses this year and still put up 6. I guess I\\'m just wondering as you look out to 2017, are there some initial thoughts you have around the election from an end market standpoint outside of tax that make you incrementally concerned? Is there -- maybe just high level what makes you think you\\'re going to get that kind of 150 to slowdown year-over-year? Yes, great question, John, and thanks for that. And obviously, we spent a lot of time talking about, this is a team and I mentioned to Alicia before the call I think we may be the first company in our space with had a new guidance after the U.S elections. So, what I am going to tell you is kind of factors we are thinking about and then also give you may be some little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate, we did as a company. But we don’t yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to regulatory market. What\\'s going to happen to our customers in the food markets, environmental markets, the FDA regulatory markets? So, we know there is going to be a customer impact. What\\'s going to happen with U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What\\'s going to happen in the trade agreements? There has been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax and more of the M&A environment change in terms of. So, I can say right now Jonathan is perhaps like everybody else on this call, we kind of as a sense of the issues, but we don’t know which way these things are go yet. So, we are not going to call them. And that\\'s one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent cautious initial guide to FY \\'17. If I look at the end market, I mean pharma is going to continue to be strong, but we don’t believe that it can continue to grow double-digits throughout all of place FY \\'17. So, we\\'ve tapered down our expectations to bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just fantastic for us. I think our number of the year was 21% growth for the year. I am dialing that back a bit to double-digits. So what we are doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we\\'ve seen to be some pretty difficult comparison some market that really have been driving to business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the term on energy. One of the thing you pointed out Jonathan and what\\'s I am really delighted is, we\\'ve had 6% close to 6% growth two years in a row with our number two market declining for eight quarters. When that market turns that obviously will help us in the growth, so -- but I\\'ve learned over the first two years in this job, it\\'s really hard to call turns of the major markets. So, I\\'m not going to and we\\'re just kind of keeping eye on it and will update you as we go through the year. But that\\'s our thinking about how our view in the U.S. elections and thus far behind our end market guidance for next year. Yes, so obviously whether you have 8% growth there, obviously you\\'re probably going to say it\\'s too early to think about how hospitals may react to the potential repeal of ACA. But although the PD-L1 testing business, how much of your growth was driven by that market and can you size that market for us yet? Well, it\\'s I can start by saying that we have been very pleased with the performance of the PD-L1 over the last 12. I think its 13 months now and it has been growing, it\\'s not to our expectation then above even, and we expect that to continue to grow by now based on Keytruda going first line; and obviously now with all companion diagnostic, we would see a bigger demand for U.S. in Europe and in other regions. The market itself is very difficult to size as you know that both been the companion with one drug and then has been into complimentary with another drug and those have very different concise at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size at the HER2 market, but the difference is that HER2 was only one, basically one drug, one glass of drug together with one diagnostics where that the PD-L1 will be up to five different drugs and maybe more, and then five different diagnostic maybe even for a lot of indications also. So, this is as closest I can get to right now, and the market we placed in is that the two companion diagnostics that we have today continue to grow strongly. I won\\'t say that\\'s the overall acting driver for the 8% basically all our businesses today have their very nice close performance, but it\\'s definitely contributing. The pace in the quarter was very good. Can you talk a little bit about backlog and I guess did you pulled, are you ready to pull anything for the first quarter and I mean any unusual spending patterns that you though? Thanks for the question Derik. So, as I mentioned earlier, we saw strength throughout the quarter and we were quite delighted with the results. And we\\'re not specifically comment about quarters or backlog, but I did say in earlier comments that we are well positioned for 2017. I would ask you to think about the Q1 particularly the impact of Chinese Lunar New Year. I told, Didier, he said I don’t want to talk about it in the Q1 call. So, let\\'s make sure that we included in our guide, so that is the one thing that I would ask you to think about in terms of the next three months of the Company\\'s performance. Because we think will probably push about a week\\'s worth of revenue or so from Q1 and Q2 because customers just won\\'t be there to take delivery and as you saw all the growth rates have been really exceptional for us in China. I appreciate the New Years\\' comments. I am just going to follow that up with another question. Are you -- have you had any conversation with your customer that I mean obviously you\\'re not the only trying to figure out what the new world order is in terms of how spending is going to be. Are you worried at all about potential in terms of lower CapEx spending, lower spending beginning of the year as people trying to get their arms around what exactly with the administration have in store? No, actually we don’t have that concern. What we\\'ve been more thinking about as where the things going on long term. So, but in the next quarter, we don’t have any real concern about that. And that\\'s why we are going our full year guidance here in November, and it\\'s really hard to see what\\'s going to happen longer term throughout the year. But in the next quarter or so, we wouldn\\'t expect that to have any significant impact. Doing well. May be just touching on China again, could you may be talk about what your underlying trends have been driving the outsized growth for the Company? Is it bio pharma? Is it food? Is it environmental? And how does that impact as you look to next year? Thanks. Thanks for the question. I have to say really it was across the Board with one exception which is the chemical and energy of market. So, all the other markets were up quite substantially for us and I think this is consistent with what we had talked about in prior call, which is really there is going to be a level of investment in China relative to quality of life issues and environmental, and food lined directly with their five year plan that they were in midst of a major improvement in overall pharma industry, and that there is a lot of money going into to research. And then, I think the reason Agilent has been able to do so well here as we got this combination of we\\'ve working reorganization structure, our China model in the country, we\\'ve had a lot of stability over the last 18 months. So, we got a really strong team there and that combinations of the team are historical strength in China and the new products we have. It\\'s all coming together in terms of growth and I guess let me just add one thing and Mark perhaps you can comment on here. We often talk about the strength of end market and the new products going to this end markets, but I think there is something going on relative to your business there and the move to service is I think worth common as well. Thanks, Mike, and thanks Bill to add little color to that as we\\'ve seen a fundamental shift in buying behaviors in China largely shifting from the core areas at around Shanghai, Beijing, to some of the more tier 2, tier 3 cities where services now is viewed as the common place purchasing item in China. And that\\'s certainly driving the growth, but the breath of services is I think in China as well as the consumable business now is the rest the story, where they have reached the size and scale that they have the same interest that we find in the western market, around the enterprise services and consumable all coming together. So, starting as you mentioned Mike with our extraordinarily strong position to start with, the installed base of China is just allowed us to build the business and truly outgrow our expectations in the second half around this too. Yes, I mentioned, I asked market to comment on that because as you may recall, we really have changed the portfolio composition of the Company much more in the aftermarkets. So, CapEx instruments are actually less than 50% now with total Company\\'s revenue. And historically China has been driven by new instrument purchases. We\\'re seeing increasing growth also come in services and consumables. And then just a follow up for Didier on the guidance, CapEx about 200 million this year, could you maybe just talk about where the incremental dollars are going and maybe what do you think the maintenance CapEx is for as one as a whole? The main reason for the increase which is about $60 million from 139 this year to 200 next year is really the significant increase that we\\'re planning in terms of our nucleic acid facility RNA-based therapeutics and in Colorado. So, we had one facility, we\\'re still expanding the capacity of that facility, but we\\'re building and we\\'ve just started few weeks ago; 20 miles away a second facility that will kind of double the capacity when it\\'ll be put in production end of 2018, 2019. So, that is the main reason for the increase and starting in 2018 we should start, we will see a reduction in the CapEx, this is not the run rate, our CapEx run rate is still between $100 million and $120 million per year. So, this is way above our run rate. I wanted to follow up on the diagnostics business really thought it was a nice quarter on a tough comp. Maybe you talk about the PL-1, but just any more the focus on the Omnis and just whether you think you\\'re picking up steam in the 2017 and anything worth watching on the reimbursement side with that? Jack, thanks for the question, I think I\\'ll pass it over to Jacob, maybe little bit more color on the quarter results. We really continue to see overall in our radiance pick up, driven definitely by Omnis that we see the growth is coming back. It\\'s nice momentum we\\'re seeing, and it continues to -- basically, it continues to increase over, during \\'16. So, with that momentum we expect that we will continue to see a good performance into \\'17 also. From the reimbursement perspective obviously there\\'re already some expectations how that would look like into \\'17 and \\'18, with the Pama [ph] and so on. But now we\\'ll have to see what happens under the new administration here, where that would change anything. But so far, we actually don\\'t expect any significant changes into \\'17. And then just want to follow up on the margin again, and just from our seat what we should be watching? And what would push you to the 22% above the level for this year? What are some of the actions that you think are going to be critical for doing that? I mean, Didier, feel free to augment my response here, but I think obviously it\\'s going to be volume which is about 60% of the margin improvement comes from volume. And the things that we can control, we\\'re on top of. So, it\\'s really that\\'s the one thing I can control is what\\'s going to happen in the market, so obviously there\\'s that 60% tied to margin. And then we\\'ve got some pretty big initiatives in the gross margin area with the water fulfillment team. I think you may have heard me speak previously about some of our work in the value engineering, material cost, reduction in logistics; so I think I also would keep an eye on gross margins as we work through the year. Some of the things take a while to actually start coming through your P&L, but once they\\'re there they\\'re there for an extended period of time. Didier, anything else do you want to add to that? No, I mean, I mean we do have stretch goals as we mentioned, we are paid internally on the achieving 22% and that means all of us have stretched goals to make, to achieve that, to contribute to 22%, and OSS and there is Henrik, the order fulfillment on supply channel organization which has delivered greatly in \\'16 is looking at opportunities to deliver even more in \\'17, which would help us bridge the gap. Yes. Thanks, Didier, and one additional though here as I think it\\'s important to remind everyone is that some of the things are going to help in \\'17 have already been finished in \\'16. So, things such as our simplification of our financial systems infrastructures, so it\\'s done, and now the statement would show up in \\'17. First, question is quickly on the quarter. Curious, if you can comment on pacing, you guys have the off cycle calendar there with October, I am sure everyone curious is whether it was on the capital spending side or any particular end market you thought a meaningful acceleration or deceleration in the month of October? I think you said that pertains other rest of the calendar year? No, Isaac, I just mentioned that what we saw was really strong pacing throughout the quarter, so wasn\\'t -- we didn\\'t see something happened all in sudden in the last four or five weeks. We had strength all through three quarters of our fiscal year close. Got it. Thank you. And then may be a longer term question Mike regarding management incentives. You guys have spent a lot of time over the last couple of years taking about the emphasis on hitting on your margin goals and you guys have done that pretty well. So, as you moved pass that 22% number, I was wondering how you think about evolving incentive structure for the management team? And should we assume that the types of incentives you have in place have been placed maybe with slightly different targets? Or could you overall composition evolve a little bit here? Isaac, it\\'s a great question and I would point back to what we discussed back at the May AID where we really said, but this is really all about is generating superior earnings growth, right. So, if you think about what we are trying to do here is we are trying to outgrow the market, expanding operation margin to keep driving up our adjusted earnings per share growth. So what we\\'d like to be able to do is really that should be the focus of the team as we move forward. Operating margin expansion and capital deployment and your growth of market are ways to get there, so we\\'d like to really be that have become the cornerstone of our long-term focus, and we want Agilent view as a company who grows their earnings faster than revenue. But as I mentioned, the AID is I really want to also make sure that, we don’t get so focus on continue to drive up the operating margin the year in and year out, that you pass something that immediately to say accretive, may be the dilutive on your margins but with good M&A additions to the business. So, I think the way we\\'re going to talk about the Company post \\'17 is very consistent with what we had talked about back in the spring in New York City. Most of my questions have been addressed, Mike, just curious what you\\'re embedding for the government academic market globally for next year? And any color you can give us sort of regionally would be helpful? Sure, Brandon, as we look through my notes here, I think we\\'re expecting low-single digit growth. And I think it\\'s important to kind of parse it out by academia in government. So, we think to go by the major regions right, China is going to be strong. And they\\'ve actually helped to mitigate some of that\\'s been happening in the U.S. and Europe. We\\'re not expecting much in Europe, it\\'s been down, it was down again, but not. It was basically sort of almost feels that the chemical energy market, which is kind of struggling along at a reduced rate. We\\'re not expecting the governments there to do anything in terms of more stimulus. In fact one of the things we\\'re watching us, what they\\'re going to do as a result of Brexit for those things. So, we expect the strong China academic government, we expect the continuation of this current environment in Europe. In United States, the academia side is not bad. It\\'s, what we\\'ve seen more it\\'s been on the U.S. government side. The U.S. government, our U.S. government business is down in 2016 relative to 2015. And that\\'s why in my call I mentioned, we need to kind of see where this new administration goes with its budget plans and investment priority. So, right now, we\\'re kind of standing at the side line as same as it\\'s going to continue to be just like it is, but in the United States, but we could see something different in the few months, we just don’t know. Mike, just following up on the outlook. How are you thinking about the pacing of growth in chemical and energy in 2017, as the assumption that you kind of see some sequential improvement through the year or you basically flat lining to the business across the quarters just given that we haven’t seen much in the way of positive signals? I think you anticipated my answer, so we basically have flat line for the year. And it\\'s been shrinking for last seven or eight quarters, 2% or 3% I think we ended up down about 3% for the full year, and we\\'re basically seeing it\\'s going to be flattish for 2017. If there is any good news to that story as these fundamental industries are still out there in terms of gasoline is being produced, we\\'ve seen record levels production in United States. For example, the plants are running, there is lot of discussion, there is lot of report externally about a turn, Oil prices have been inching up. But our history is here is that it\\'s really hard to know exactly when it\\'s going to turn, what I can say is that, if you have a profitability of productivity message associated with something you can bring to the laboratory then they might listen to you. And we\\'re hopeful that some of our new product introductions will hit the mark there, but in terms of our overall market assumption and growth assumption for the Company, we\\'re assuming flat for 2017. No big movements, one way or another. Got it. Okay, great. And then maybe just to go back to the M&A and the margin comments as we sort of think about the moving parts on the out margin guidance and just what you might look to do this year how at risk is the current out margin outlook from additional M&A? I mean obviously it\\'s tough to discuss these things in the abstract, but are you open to further dilution if the right asset comes along? Or do you kind of think you hold the line of the current forecast? Thanks. I think what we said; I am really trying to be having actions that consistent with our prior communications. We said, we would look at acquisition that could be short-term dilutive in nature. And we did one in latter part of \\'16 when we just love having at last part of portfolio. It\\'s a great addition to the business, but right now it\\'s not that corporate average. We will move it up, so if we saw the opportunities like that we would pursue them. But I think if you want to look at type of the deals and the size and other things, just look at what we\\'ve done so far. To give you the kind of a sense of the things that we\\'re looking at point forward, we like accretive deals and we like one that can move up move with move the margins up. Just quick follow-up, if I could on the pharma and just wanted to understand there is clearly a solid contribution here. If you could maybe help us parse out, is that more coming from service small molecules and macro molecules? Or is this, are we thinking about them directly? Maybe we should be thinking about in terms of the service contract share that you\\'re gaining via the CrossLab Group? Help us if you could parse that out a little bit. Sure. So, there is something going on which is in terms of the overall fundamental end market growth rates, we think bio pharma in the small molecule side of pharma both growing quite strongly. Small molecule side is really being drive by a conversion to the new technologies of liquid chromatography in particular, also an increasing interest in enterprise service what we have to offer from ACG. So, I think that\\'s being going on here for Agilent. We\\'ve had a combination of the really strong end market growth. There is a new market that has and will continue to develop in this services side, and we are doing well there along with our new instruments in the pharma. When I look at \\'17, we think that the biopharma side of that market is going to continue to go quite strongly within an area of prioritization for us in terms of new solutions. But we do think that overtime that the small molecule will start to move back towards more of a long-term growth rate. And Patrick, I think would we kind of think about a long-term growth rates in this small molecule side. Well, on the small molecule side, I think the more and low-to mid single-digits range whereas in bio pharma, we are more optimistic and it continues to be double digits, that\\'s our projection right now. All right. Thank you for that. Just one more in terms of the chemical energy markets, I mean we get the view into 2017, but as you have conversation with the labs and lab directors, so just help us understand. How they are thinking about capital equipment and 2017 knowing this times and knowing that the progression that\\'s been? Or are they thinking more in 2018 terms on the capital equipment? I have to say, I don’t think they really know yet as well. What they are doing right now is they\\'re right in the midst of their capital budgeting process. So, what I can tell you is as I\\'ve had a couple of conversation with customers over the last two or three weeks on this exact topic. And what they described for me is, hey, these are one customer was somebody who provides services into equipment into the energy market. So listen, we are starting to get interest in quotes. But we are not sure where that\\'s going to hit in \\'17 or \\'18. When we had our VIP launch for the Intuvo 9000 GC, a lot of customers from energy had listened. We love this productivity message you have here. I think there\\'s a real economic ROI. I\\'m now right in the midst of my budgeting process inside the Company. And maybe I\\'ll be able to get this improve this year or maybe the following year because there still seems to be the sentiment particularly with the larger companies, they want to hold on to the equipment as long as they can before they have replaced. And so again, that\\'s why I pointed to the fact that\\'s not all negative because of the fact that we do have a strong service in consumables offering into that space. But again, we just don\\'t -- I don\\'t think our customers know yet as well what\\'s going to happen. We do know it\\'s going to happen. History will repeat itself. There\\'ll be a replenishment of aged equipment, but again we\\'re just not confident enough right now to say when that\\'s going to occur. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Thank you everybody and on behalf of the management team, I wanted to thank you for joining us on the call. If you have any questions, feel free to give us the call at IR. Appreciate it very much. Bye-bye. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I\\'m very pleased to announce that the Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter with both revenue and earnings well above the high end of our guidance. We continue to deliver above market growth. Revenues of $1.10 billion exceeded the high end of our February guidance by $42 million and are up 9% on a core basis. Our adjusted EPS of $0.58 is $0.09 above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS is up 32% over the second quarter of last year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, up 270 basis points from a year ago. This is our ninth quarter in a row of improving operating margins.  Let\\'s now take a closer look at the better-than-expected Q2 performance. The story for the quarter are growth well above expectations in the chemical and energy, pharma and European markets, while our Asia business remains strong.  The lead story was the stronger-than-expected pickup in the chemical and energy market with 14% core growth. This comes on the heels of return to modest growth last quarter after 7 consecutive prior quarters of decline. What\\'s driving this higher-than-expected growth in our chemical and energy business? While the exploration segment remains challenged, the growth is broad-based across all geographies and product categories, particularly gas chromatography, spectroscopy and aftermarket services and consumables. Chemical and refining customers are increasing their CapEx purchases. Our customers in material and mining segments have also started reinvesting after a prolonged period of declining sales.  Core growth in pharma, 12% against a difficult compare, also exceeded expectations. Demand continues across our pharma spectrum with highest growth in the biopharma segments and our NASD business. We are seeing strong customer interest in our new offerings and across our portfolio. Our broad and differentiated opportunities in chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, services and chemistries well position us to capitalize on a strong pharma demand.  A few other end market comments. Our food business was up 1% against a difficult compare of 25% core growth last year. Food market fundamentals remained sound. Environmental and forensics were up 7% on the strength in the Americas and Europe. As expected, academia and government market funding conditions remained weak, with our business down 2% for the quarter.  Geographically, Europe exceeded our expectations with 10% core growth. Except for academia and government, European growth was across all market segments with particular strength in the applied markets. Asia growth remains strong at 10%, with China delivering high single-digit growth against last year\\'s growth of nearly 40% and in line with our expectations.  Let\\'s now turn to specifics for our business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 6%. Growth was led by higher-than-expected strength in chemical energy, pharma and environmental. From a product perspective, performance were broad-based across the portfolio with strength in chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and cell analysis. We continue to strengthen our instrumentation solutions portfolio. In large, we introduced the 6495B Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system. This new offering provides greater sensitivity and accuracy for applications such as food safety and environmental testing. We also added to our portfolio of solutions in biopharma with the introduction of the Agilent 6545XT AdvanceBio LC/Q-TOF MS system. This system optimizes results for scientists seeking to characterize biomolecules that could be the basis for new therapies.  As we continue to see the external recognition of innovation and market leadership, at Pittcon 2017, Agilent won 2 prestigious Scientist Choice Awards, including Best New Separation Product of 2016 for the 1260 Infinity II LC system and Best Webinar Series of 2016 for our series on solutions and biopharmaceutical discovery and development. At the Annual Conference of China Scientific Instruments, the gasoline Intuvo 9000 Gas Chromatograph System was selected as the Green Product of the Year and the Agilent 5977B GC/MS system won for the Most Popular Scientific Instrument. At this same China conference for the second year in a row, Agilent was recognized as the most influential foreign manufacturer. Our pipeline of new products are strong, and we\\'re looking forward to the upcoming ASMS Conference on their latest innovations from Agilent.  The Agilent CrossLab\\'s group\\'s strong performance continues with core revenue growth of 10%, well distributed across most regions and end markets. Our enterprise services and consumables growth was standout for the quarter.  Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics group delivered core revenue growth of 13% while driving improvements in our operating margin. Growth was broad-based across pathology, companion diagnostics with particularly strong growth through our nucleic acid, CDMO business.  We continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We introduced a new Target Enrichment Solution for next-generation DNA sequencing, Agilent SureSelect Clinical Research Exome V2. This solution delivers more than 1,000 additional disease-relevant targets compared to earlier version. We introduced Agilent\\'s first CGH assay for diagnostic use, the GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay. This assay will enable to detect genetic anomalies earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.  In a significant win, Agilent was named the primary IHC and special stains vendor for Quest Diagnostics. This is a testament to the advantage of our standing workflow solution. As a reminder, the integration of the former Dako business under Agilent\\'s systems was completed in Q1, and we\\'re starting to see the bottom line benefits of more streamlined cost structure. We are in the early phase of integrating the Multiplicom acquisition into Agilent and even more excited to have the Agilent Multiplicom team to be part of Agilent.  Coming off the strong start to 2017 in the past 2 quarters, how are we thinking about the coming quarters? Let\\'s start with our lead story for the quarter, the chemical and energy market. We are pleased to see two consecutive quarters now of growth in the chemical and energy market. However, it is early, and we\\'re not yet ready to call a cyclical recovery. We do remain confident in our ability to capture market share in this market segment irrespective of market conditions. We are the recognized leader in this space with an increasingly strong value proposition for our customers.  Looking ahead at our other end markets, with the exception of the academia and government markets, we see solid market conditions for the pharma, food, environmental and clinical and diagnostics market. Specific to Parma, investment levels remained strong, but we do expect some declining growth rates due to increasingly difficult compares.  And a few additional comments on academia and government. We are expecting a continued weak funding environment across most geographies with the exception of China. In the United States, recent approval of the U.S. Federal budgets through September is an encouraging sign, but we\\'ve not set -- we have not yet seen funds being released.  Geographically, we expect the U.S. and China to grow consistent with prior expectations, while the growth trajectory in Europe is uncertain. The outlook for Europe is highly dependent on the macroeconomic environment continuing to improve. We do not expect European government and academia spending to improve, and we are taking a wait-and-see approach on the European chemical and energy market, both major contributors to overall European performance.  These cautions aside, we are excited about the company\\'s growth prospects and the steps we are taking to position the company for future growth. We are raising our full year core revenue growth and earnings expectations. Didier will share the details later in our call. Before I turn the call over to Didier, let me close with a few comments.  Q2 \\'17 marked the 2-year anniversary of this Agilent leadership team being put in place and the full initiation of our company-wide transformation initiatives. Over 2 years ago, we outlined a path to increase shareholder value that was focused on outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins on an organic basis and deploying capital in a balanced manner. We have delivered on our shareholder commitments every quarter since then. We have continue to outgrow the market and increase profitability each quarter often in challenging and economic circumstances. We have improved operating margins by 300 basis points during this period with a company-wide drive for continued profitability improvements. During the same period, we deployed our capital in a balanced manner with acquisitions and strategic investments of $547 million, cash dividends of $334 million and share repurchase of $889 million.  Behind these results are an energized Agilent team with a relentless commitment to customers. In our Agilent DNA is our team\\'s ability to drive customer-focused innovation coupled with operational excellence. It is this powerful combination that will continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion.  I look forward to answering your questions later in the call and will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q2 results and updated guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered another strong performance this quarter, 9% core revenue growth, 270 basis points of operating margin expansion, 32% EPS growth and $257 million in operating cash flow even after contributing $25 million to our U.S. pension plan. The revenue performance drove most of the operating margin and EPS performance.  During the quarter, we bought back 1.64 million shares of Agilent stock at an average price of $50.60 and paid $43 million in dividends.  I will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion and EPS of $0.49 to $0.51. At midpoint, revenue will grow 4% on a core basis. As Mike stated, at this stage, we are not ready yet to call a cyclical recovery that assumes the sustainability of Q2\\'s strong chemical and energy and European markets.  Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2017. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $30 million, including $10 million due to currency. Thus, we\\'re increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from 4.5% to 5%. We\\'re also raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.05 including about $0.005 coming from FX. There is no chance to operating cash flow guidance of $825 million and CapEx guidance of $200 million.  It\\'s actually Joel in for Isaac. Appreciate all the chemical and energy end market color you guys provided. But just from a company-specific perspective, could you maybe quantify how much the Intuvo 9000 product cycle contributed to the organic growth this quarter? How about I make a few comments about our gas chromatography business and I\\'ll turn it over on to some specifics on the Intuvo GC launch? So in -- we know the very strong performance in the chemical and energy as well as environmental market for the company in Q2, and a contributor of that was the performance of our gas chromatography business, high single-digit growth we saw in gas chromatography mainly through our 7890 core product line. As you know, we\\'ve indicated in previous calls that Intuvo will take some time to ramp and that we were expecting to be a more material impact on the company\\'s P&L as we went into the latter parts of this year into FY \\'18. So perhaps, you can give a little color, though, Patrick, on how the Intuvo launch has actually come along and how customers respond to the offering. Okay, yes. Thank you, Mike. And so we are very happy with the launch. We have seen exciting feedback from our first customers out there. That said, we are still in the ramp phase with the product. We are still placing a lot of demo units out there. The product is quite different into use -- user interface, et cetera, in used model compared to our standard product of 7890. We have put a lot of emphasis on usability, ease-of-use. So customers really want to touch and see it first before they make a buying decision. And as I said, the feedback is very positive so far from the customers we have seen. We are ramping the product. It has not been a significant contributor to revenues this quarter yet, but we are very confident that we have a real winning product in our hands here, and it will make a more significant impact in the quarters to come. So we are, I would say, bullish on the outlook. But for this quarter, it was not a very significant contributor yet. Very helpful. And then in the context of the revenue and earnings upside we\\'ve seen throughout the first half of the year, are there any R&D programs or maybe channel investments that you guys are accelerating into the back half of the year? I\\'d say we\\'ve been really pretty much staying on our plan on record so -- which, as you know, has been to invest at a higher level on the average in the industry and R&D. And I think I\\'ve been pretty transparent in some prior calls that we also were building a lot -- adding a lot more a channel coverage and specialization, particularly in such areas such as biopharma. So I think we\\'re just tracking to the plan. And as we said, we were delighted by the Q2 revenue results. This is Mike Sarcone in for Dan Leonard. So another question on the chemical and energy end market. I think you mentioned that exploration remains challenged. So does that mean you did see an improvement on the refining side in the energy segment? And can you just elaborate on that and as well as the chemical performance? Sure, happy to. So now just as a reminder for the audience, when we look at our chemical and energy market segmentation, historically, about 15% of our business has been in exploration. And I\\'d say that continues to be down very strongly, so no signs of real life there at all. The other 35% of the total is in the refining area, and we have started to see some levels of reinvestment in the refining. And then also in the chemical side, which makes up the other 50%, we\\'ve seen investments starting up there again. Inconclusive in the space, we also report our sales into the mining and materials segments. So I\\'d say the 85% of the segment shows signs of life, though not yet ready to call a full cyclical recovery. The other 15% in exploration remains down. And if I could just pivot to biopharma. It seemed like through the quarter, end market performance diverged geographically for some of your peers or other tools players with exposure to the end market. And by that, I mean, there\\'s also some underperformance in North America. Did you see any of that in your biopharma business? No, no. Not at all. We saw a strong performance across all geographies, and one of the things that -- and no real notable difference in terms of relative to our expectations. One thing I did try to note in the earnings call was the broad-based nature of our portfolio, which allows us to really capture a lot of the demand there beyond, say, liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Mike, just trying to get our arms around the guidance here. You\\'re calling for 4% core in 3Q against an easier comp after doing 9% this quarter. Is there something that would lead to maybe some extra conservatism in the quarter ahead? Thanks, Tycho. So I\\'ll leave the characterization to our guidance to you. But what I can do share with you is this thinking. I think there really are just 2 major watch areas for us, and why we\\'re not -- and it really is the chemical energy, which, as you know, we put up a 14% growth after low single digits first quarter. So we\\'d like to see another quarter or 2 of that to see whether or not it\\'s sustained. And then on Europe, Europe was 10% growth for us, which, as you know, coming this year, we were quite concerned. Again, we want to see if the economic environment continues to improve there. But we\\'re just sort of taking a watch and see in both these areas as opposed to calling in type of sustained double-digit growth in these areas. What I would say is there\\'s no hidden kind of concerns behind our guidance that we haven\\'t been already discussing. Okay. And then for a follow-up on DDG. Obviously, good quarter there. We saw good standing numbers out of Roche as well. Is there something going on in the end market in terms of improvement there? And can you also talk on the operating margin increase? That was certainly notable. I\\'m sitting right next to Jacob here in the conference room. I know he\\'s delighted to talk about his double-digit growth and his 20-plus percent operating profit performance. So how do I pass it over to you, Jacob? Yes, thanks, Mike. And certainly, we had a great quarter. And you\\'re also right that our portfolio business continues to provide momentum. And you\\'re also right that we see competitive -- the competition also have good performance. From our perspective, we continue to see good momentum from both our Omnis business, so advance same portfolio, but also including the PD-L1, which continues to drive momentum. I don\\'t think we see a shift in the industry right now. One quarter is not making the business. We see more over a longer period of time. But I don\\'t think that we see that because 2 competitors have strong quarter that this is a change in the market environment. But we continue to see overall pathology is a strong market to be in. So I\\'ll actually start picking up on a point, I think, Tycho was alluding to, which is on margins. Didier, could you just give us a sense for what the drop-through looks like on incremental revenue in a quarter like this so we can think about how to fine tune our models best? And then as a follow-up, and it\\'s somewhat related. Mike, you had some experience now of seeing the performance of the commercial team since you integrated the sales force, and you\\'ve had a chance to take advantage of the breadth that you have in a refined service offering. I mean, how are you thinking about deploying those learnings as you see the results coming through, putting the gas pedal down maybe a little bit more? How does that make you think about the rate of OpEx growth for this business as you see the returns on these investments? Yes. And how about I start there? Didier, you can go back to the margin question. Thanks for the question, Steve. And Didier and I have been talking a bit about the future modeling of the company, and obviously, we\\'ll share more details with you later on in the year as we move into FY \\'18. But as you know, we\\'ve been really working down our SG&A levels when we first started the company. I mean, we had a lot of restructuring and consolidation, and we had a significant amount of cost savings. We have been -- and then what we tried to do from there was take the cost out and then invest based on the revenue growth. So we would expect to see the SG&A grow lower than -- and then revenue as we move forward. We\\'ve done a lot of build outs in the lot of the channel. I would tell you, though, there are some things we still like to continue to build out. The academia and government for one is one of the area where we\\'re not yet at a leadership position. So we do have some things on the drawing board where we like to have some additional incremental investments relative to today\\'s level of resourcing. But I think you\\'ll kind of see us stay with the same fundamental model of not cranking up these numbers as a percentage of revenue. And on your other question, Steve. The -- so we continue having exceptional drop-through operating margin incrementals. We\\'ve enjoyed 56% for the whole year last year. I think we had a 47% in Q1. And this quarter, we had 56% similar to what we\\'ve basically enjoyed in the last 6 quarters. So excellent drop-through., obviously, in part leading to the 9% core revenue growth. And I think it\\'s worth adding here, Didier, which is how we manage the company, right? So listen, we\\'re not going to shortchange investments, which we think we can do relative to R&D and channels for future growth. But at the same point in time, we are going to be disciplined with our spending. And I think you\\'ll see that\\'s how we\\'ve been managing the company, and that\\'s why we\\'ve been able to get some of these margins up for the overall company performance. I appreciate all the color there. Just one detail point for me, and then I\\'ll let others jump in. It has to do with the expansion of the plant in Colorado, the oligonucleotide capacity expansion. I wonder if we could get an update there on how that process is going and how we might think about the timing on when that incremental capacity could be a driver, contribution at the topline. Yes, it\\'s actually a very timely question because Didier and I just review with Jacob and the team the progress on the construction. And if you happen to find yourself on Frederick County, we can give you the address. You can drive by and wave to the construction crew there. But construction is proceeding as planned, right on target. And we got through the winter months without a lot of any kind of major disruptions to our construction. And from a -- as you know, this is a pretty complex manufacturing facility. In fact, this will be sort of a one-of-a-kind in the industry given the amount of capacity that we\\'re adding. And then it also requires a level of validation required on the site. So long story. Short of it, I think you should think about this as being an FY \\'19 revenue impact for the company. We do believe that we can continue to get strong growth in our current facility. But as you know, we\\'re going to run out of capacity, so we\\'re looking to bring that online in early FY \\'19. Mike, a question for you. I mean, with 85% of the chemical and energy business trending positively, I mean, what do you want to see before feeling more comfortable calling a bottom there? And any chance you could give us an update on what\\'s embedded in your full year outlook for core growth for that segment? Sure. So part of it is tied to the macro view of a cyclical industrial recovery, and I don\\'t think I\\'d add comments to there yet as well, so it\\'d be nice to have some external validation. And then from an Agilent perspective, I like to see another quarter or 2. My first year in the job, I can remember getting a little overly enthusiastic about a turn in the chemical and energy, and I was only off by 6 or 7 quarters when we first started seeing growth again. So having sort of learned my lesson, I\\'m a little bit more cautious about when to call the downturn -- I mean, the upturn, excuse me. Listen, we\\'ll take the business, but I think I\\'ll need another quarter or 2, and then give me a little bit of the external validation from some of the economists. And I think we\\'re looking at, Alicia, for... Okay. Super. And then one more 2-part question, though. You hired a new SVP of Strategy and Corporate Development in March, I believe. Anything to comment there in terms of your near-term M&A appetite? And then one for Didier. It looks like you took buybacks out of the second half of the year. Any signal or messaging you\\'re trying to share with us there? Yes. So first of all, Brandon, thanks a lot for the close watching of the company, and we\\'re delighted to have Sam Raha on the Agilent executive team. Sam is actually here in the conference room with us as well. And in terms of the M&A appetite, I think you\\'re seeing that we are quite interested in adding new capabilities to the company in fast-growing spaces, and we\\'ve done 4 M&A deals already. One was a strategic investment in Lasergen. We feel a lot of interesting assets out there, particularly in the private space. And given Sam\\'s experience in analyzing industry, we think this allow us to perhaps have an increased level of velocity working through targets. So I think our appetite remains the same, but what we\\'re doing is bringing on additional strong capability to help us through that process. And then I\\'ll pass this over to you, Didier. Yes, Brandon, on the buyback, you have a good eye. We have a very disciplined approach to our buyback program. Once a year in November, we register a 10b5-1, and the approach is both formulaic and opportunistic, which means that we are able to flex our buybacks according, obviously, to market conditions. And the one thing that I would also mention is that this is not a program where you don\\'t use it, you lose it. Any amount that is below what we plan to spend in a quarter is carried over to the next quarter and on and on if needs be. So with that -- last -- we felt it was more cautious with the valuations of the market that we do not forecast the buyback because there is a cap. There is no doubt. The cap was raised 13%. Last time, we raised 8% in November, and we will certainly raise it again as we register the next buyback in a few months\\' time. But we don\\'t know what we don\\'t know, and based on the potential market valuations in that, we decided that for the second half, it was better not to assume any buyback. And obviously, we don\\'t -- we will see what happens. My first question is on China. Just some clean-up there. What was growth in the quarter? Anything interesting to call out by end market? And did the timing of Lunar New Year play any role it and strength in the quarter in China? Great. Always happy to share some insights on the -- on China. In terms of our overall growth, high single digits for the quarter. I think the most thing -- most important thing to note is the compare against the 40%, almost a 40% growth rate, on the prior year. The end market demand continues to be quite healthy there, and we\\'re still on our view that this can be -- this will be a low double-digit growth country for us in 2017. So no change at all in terms of the fundamentals, which remains strong. And to your point about Lunar New Year, really no impact. So it\\'s nice not to be talking about that in an earnings call as a reason for difference in performance. So things are really looking good in China. The market fundamentals are intact there, and we\\'re really quite pleased with the performance of the company, and we\\'re right on our earlier start of the year expectations of growth for China. Okay. And not to beat a dead horse here, but I just want to push you a bit more on guidance. What -- you\\'re guiding the third quarter, as it\\'s been noted, to a moderation against the most favorable comps of the year. And then when you look ahead to Q4, your guidance implies the lowest growth rates since, I think, the first half of 2014. I mean, that just doesn\\'t make a ton of sense based on what we\\'re hearing from you across the board. Either something isn\\'t going as well as it seems, which sure doesn\\'t seem to be the case, or it seems like, at this point after 6 quarters of guiding the levels that are well below what you actually put up that, if we\\'re going to be kind of intellectually honest about what\\'s going on with the business that we should be modeling something a lot higher than what you\\'re guiding to. So with all that in mind, I just want to make sure, they were -- there was nothing in terms of the cadence in the quarter or any timing dynamics that came into play that shaped how you\\'re guiding with the second half of the year. So let me make two comments here then, Didier, feel free to add anything to that. But first of all, relative to anything that -- I forget exactly the terminology is. But anything that could be negative or significantly going wrong with the business, that\\'s, by no means, the case here. So the fundamentals of this company are very sound as well as the end markets. The point I, perhaps, will belabor if you don\\'t mind is with my experience holding a turn 2 years ago in the chemical and energy market. I called it too early, and it never happened. In fact, we drove along for 5 or 6 quarters. We also know that the European market, particularly in the summer months, is not always the strongest. So those are two things that we were watching, and that\\'s the reason why we\\'ve guided the way we want -- we\\'ve done for the second half. By the way, I think our core growth guidance guide for the year is, I think, perhaps at the upper end or higher than any of our peers. So we\\'re already moving out our core growth rate for the year higher than everybody else in our space. But based on our product experience in watching Europe and calling for a turn, a sustained turn in the chemical energy, I was wrong before, so I want to make sure I got it right this time, so we\\'ll give it a few more quarters. Didier, anything else you\\'d add to that? Well, maybe two things. Number one, on chemical and energy, basically, our revenue this quarter was a lot based on the year-end budget flush that -- in terms of orders that we saw among our customers and, perhaps, the beginning of the year. So we don\\'t know how to really read it and if it is sustainable or not for that reason. It\\'s very much related to the end of last year\\'s budget and beginning of this year\\'s budget, and they might not be totally relevant data points. We\\'ll see. And maybe the other thing is that a testament to the great work that our teams have done in terms of converting orders into revenue. I mean, we\\'ve done a fantastic job. The patent order and also -- of orders also has improved tremendously with a lot more orders coming into the first month of the quarter. All that has a positive impact also this quarter among many, many other things. Obviously, what was more important is the great order performance. And we don\\'t -- we are not able to operate with a smaller backlog than we used to back 2 years ago before we put in place this tremendous operational improvements in our managing of the orders. And so there, we have bit less visibility potentially than we used to 2 years ago, but it was not very good visibility. Now, it\\'s better in some way. It\\'s Luke in for Ross. So I guess, if -- we\\'re talking a lot about the Intuvo and your new product pipeline. I guess, can you break out how much of this quarter\\'s growth was due to the new product pipeline? And I guess, more importantly, how has this -- how is your product pipeline that exists now, how does that compare to, say, 3, 4 years ago before Mike took over the helm? So I\\'ll take that last one as well. So in terms of the contribution to this quarter\\'s revenue from new products, we don\\'t actually go through any of those internal calculations. But I\\'d have to say it\\'s been a significant contributor to the growth. So as you know -- and this is a phenomenon that has been growing for several quarters, right, because for the last 2 years, we bring into the market a number of products.  We\\'re talking about the Intuvo right now, but we have the whole infinity two series, a bunch of new spectrometry products. So we\\'ve been coming to market. Jacob\\'s team has been inducing a new genomics offering. So I have to say our business model is based on the ability to get to market new solutions that are differentiated and really do make a difference for our customers. That\\'s our business model, and I think that\\'s what\\'s been part of the reason combined with our extended channel, which we\\'ve been able to grow the way we\\'ve been growing. And -- but it may seem like not the most objective view of our performance. In fact, coming in as I put myself in the back a bit, I think our pipelines are much improved. One -- and if you recall from our earlier discussions, my first [indiscernible] in this role I described for you a massive restructuring of our R&D teams and how we set up our business units and how we put more of our instrumentation, for example, all under Patrick. And we consolidate from 3 different aspect divisions into one. I think now you\\'re starting to see those -- the impact of those because we now have our monies allocated on the biggest bet, and I think we\\'re able to get to decisions more quickly, and we\\'re able to get to market more quickly. So I believe that our product lines -- I mean, our pipelines are most robust they\\'ve ever been, and I would say to all of you on the call is we\\'re not done yet. So we have a lot of great ideas, very strong team. And I think our -- but our pipeline and portfolio has never been in better shape. Great. And I guess, turning to the gross margins. They\\'re really strong in the quarter. Can you just dig in a little bit more there? Like, what was leading that strength in the business [indiscernible] going forward? Yes, I\\'ll make some high-level comments, and I think -- then I\\'ll pass it on to Didier. So obviously, topline growth at 9% core growth helps a lot. But we also have a number of initiatives underway in order fulfillment team, our global manufacturing footprint under Henrik. And we\\'re getting a lot of cost out of our materials, optimizing overhead costs as well as driving down logistics. But anything else you\\'d add? It\\'s probably a mix impact there, I think, as well. Nothing to add. Obviously, I chose -- 30 years ago, you started as a -- in the controllership organization, Mike. I guess, I got a couple of short ones since a lot of what I\\'ve wanted to know was asked. Can you just break out the instrument versus consumable organic growth for the quarter? Well, I guess, you\\'re probably referring to the analytical side of the house. I think the best way to look at that is just go to the performance of the LSAG and ACG groups. So I believe Patrick was up 6% and -- on a core basis. And Mark and the CrossLab Group was double digit at 10%. Great. Just on the -- you called out this winning this order in Quest for staining. Can you give us an idea sort of the magnitude on how that sort of works in the numbers going forward? Yes, so we were pretty excited by this, as you imagine. It\\'s a pretty significant win. I think it really is a testament to what we believe is a -- it is an excellent product that the Omnis Autostainer was introduced. It\\'s a real validation of how strong that product offering is. But Jacob, perhaps, you want to add a few comments in terms of the deal parameters, at least, perhaps, described for Derik how the rollout looks, the multiyear deal. Yes, Thanks. And as you can imagine, we are quite happy with -- that we won this account. And as you know, Quest is one of the biggest reference laboratories in the U.S., so this is a substantial deal for us. I cannot go into the actual numbers, but we are looking at a multiple site rollout over the next 6 to 9 months, where we will install on this in all of the Quest sites here in the U.S. And we look at many, many on this and many, many hundred thousands of slides test that will be run on those instruments within a year time frame. And sort of a follow-up. I remember when you bought Dako back in 2012, the business was sort of underperforming and sort of lagging peers. Can you sort of talk about where we are sort of with Dako these days? And I guess, how are -- are you sort of going back at the market or the consumable is sort of back where it\\'s going? I mean, is that tracking on where you thought it would be? Yes, I mean, so I\\'ve been part of that journey for quite a while now, and I\\'m very pleased where we are today. Omnis is definitely a driver of that. And then, we played instrument to drive consumables. So what is we -- the key indicator for us internally is how our consumables, our test volume, is increasing. And we can see a very, very strong momentum in the test volume, not only from our PD -L1, but also from our broad portfolio of assays. So I see both strong win over of new accounts and also current accounts driving more and more slides out there. So I will say that we have turned that business around, and there\\'s still a lot we can do. But I feel like we\\'re now working on an market growth level, and there\\'s more and more to do and much more to come. So just if I could touch briefly on just the GCM. A couple of other questions have already been answered, so maybe if I could ask on the -- overall, in the LC/MS business, seems like that continues to grow. Could you maybe give us a sense of -- if you\\'re taking share with Q-TOF? And appreciate the comments in Q-TOF and triple quads there. Are you taking share in that market with Q-TOF versus the high-resolution competitors in the market? Or is it more of the biomolecules growth that you continue to see in that market that\\'s propelling the numbers forward? First of all, thank you very much for the congratulatory comments, and I think I\\'ll pass it over to Patrick and give you -- share some more insights in terms of what\\'s going on with LC/MS. Yes. Thank you, Mike. And you\\'re right, Puneet, it\\'s not only the triple quad market that\\'s strong. When you look at the opportunity in Q-TOF, it\\'s playing in the biomolecule market. As Mike said, we just launched a new bio Q-TOF that drives healthy growth on the biopharma. And with that along -- and along that also, we\\'ve put the Q-TOF itself. We also deploy, as you know, the Q-TOF in applied markets like environmental when you do pesticide screening and environmental fluid, et cetera. We have very differentiated solutions from our side, so I think that we have a great opportunity with this platform. We don\\'t disclose market shares and market share gains. But I would say with what we have launched and also what we\\'re launching at the upcoming ASMS, we are looking very much forward to continue growth in the LC/MS market. Okay. Got that. Just a brief one, if I could, on the expectations for the pharmDx PD-L1 test that you have in place. There are competitors that have been entering that market with our label expansion. So has that changed your opportunity overall in that market? What\\'s your thoughts there? Yes, I can take that also, and you\\'re absolutely right that we see competitors entering to the market. That is not unexpected once you get in a CDx business and when you are departments with a pharma company that you enter and you get a first move advantage, meaning that many accounts have already implemented our test and trained the pathologies in reading out as a slide. So even as a new competitor coming in there, that is, of course, increased competition. But we believe we are in a very strong position to continue with our leadership position. I wanted to follow up on the back of the Intuvo launch. Do you think you\\'re seeing more pull through across selling opportunities across the rest of the portfolio? Maybe any intangible signs at CrossLab or elsewhere? Yes, absolutely. So we\\'ve been calling this the inside to cover the halo effect. So as you may know in this space, gas chromatography is often viewed as a very mature technology. So customers aren\\'t anxious to have a sales rep come out and talk about the gas chromatography. Different story when you\\'re -- you\\'ve got a product like Intuvo, which is it\\'s so different. And customers now recognize that there\\'s really something special here with this offering. So what we\\'re finding is that our account manager was able to go out and get appointments, meet with a customer. And then that allows us to have a broader discussion around the productivity improvements and enhancements on, for example, our 7890 or we can talk about our enterprise services and consumables. You may have noted -- and I\\'ll ask Mark to chime in on this since he\\'s been the -- probably quiet on call so far on the consumables and services side. But what we\\'ve seen is we get into a different conversation with a customer, and that\\'s why you noticed in my earnings call script, I talked a lot about the broad-based growth in chemical and energy. I think this Intuvo GC has been great to help us get into a different set of conversations with customers. And, Mark, I don\\'t know if you\\'d add anything on what you\\'re seeing on the consumables and services side because you had double-digit growth in that space as well. Well, I have just a couple of things, Mike, and we\\'ve talked before about how we\\'ve seen the market over the last couple of years. As customers continued to use their assets, improve the performance of the asset itself, keep their -- obviously, their operations going, and when we see the tailwind, if you will, from now more purchase in the marketplace, it\\'s really more just a surge of new installation that provides some additional revenues in the space. So overall, though, the differentiation in the market, it comes back to some work we\\'re doing and inside of our chemistries division around new technologies associated with the Intuvo, also advancing some of the chemistries we\\'ve done in very traditional space, in GC columns and seeing some nice market gains there. So all in all, it\\'s just -- it\\'s been proved to be a case where customers continue to buy based on keeping it going, but also on top of that, look towards the additional revenues from the expansion in the energy space. Yes. Thanks, Mark. And just to kind of close it off, Jack, which I think what we\\'re able to do is actually go out and talk about the whole portfolio with the customer including some of the new capabilities and marketing that\\'s brought on board as well. That\\'s great. And then I have the follow-up on the margins and DGG. I think it\\'s the best ever on record that we have, at least our model has. Maybe could you just talk about the scalability of the business as you see it now? And was there anything onetime in the quarter? Just you called out the Quest win again. Just any other color. I mentioned earlier, we\\'re -- the management team is in the conference together taking this call, and there\\'s a big smile on Jacob\\'s face that somebody noticed. And he\\'s well on his task to hitting that -- he\\'s driving for 20% this year. Obviously, the strong revenue performance helped a lot in terms of the operating margin. But perhaps, you want to build on that? Yes, you\\'re absolutely right that we -- the topline drives our bottom line also, so the margin really has driven the 24% margin. Operating margin, we have up 900 basis points, is certainly something I\\'m very pleased with. What I want to remind also is that if you look into Q1, we come from a lower margin perspective there. So the 2 quarters, the first half of the year here is really around the 20%, where I believe we have committed to delivering on this business for the full year. So we are still on that track, and that\\'s what we\\'re aiming for. Maybe I\\'ll just add to that. I mentioned it in my call script, but the early part of this year marked a major milestone for us, which was the integration of the former Dako business into the Agilent infrastructure and systems. And I think that is part of your story. I mean, that was always part of the plant, but that\\'s also why we think that some of these improvements all being, let\\'s say, a 24% operating margin every quarter. But that\\'s also why I believe some of these improvements are sustainable because we are fundamentally changing the underlying cost structure that support this business. Mike, again, it doesn\\'t look like we\\'re getting together -- Mike, it doesn\\'t look like we\\'re getting together for Analyst Day this spring, so maybe just one on strategy. Wondering if you can offer anything on how interested you are in M&A at this point. And to the extent that you\\'re looking around at assets, what might you be willing to deploy? And then where might the focus be? Yes, I think, first of all, you correctly noted. We\\'re not holding an Analyst Day this year. It\\'s not to say that we won\\'t do it again, but we felt like the first year was important for the management team to come out and tell the new story. I thought it was important a year later to tell you how it\\'s going. And then a lot of the coaching and obviously [indiscernible] hey, Mike, we really prefer you to have you spend a lot of time just run the business and focus on customers. So that\\'s our plan. But we\\'ll probably back out at some point in time with Analyst Day as we move into \\'18. Relative to M&A, I would just leave it as I think what the communication we\\'ve had for the prior quarters remain the same, which is we like assets that are in parts of the marketplace, which we see inherently growing faster, whether it be the acquisition we made of Seahorse Bioscience. And I hope you notice that we called out cell analysis as a driver for growth in our LSAG business. We acquired most recently Multiplicom, which is in a faster-growing molecular diagnostics space. So we like assets that -- where the end markets are growing faster than, perhaps, the corporate average. We\\'re bringing a new capability to the company, and we love they\\'re accretive short term. And what we realized is that a lot of the deals actually is going to incur, we believe, in the private space. And we have a pretty active funnel. We like the bolt-on acquisitions. We will do every once in a while technology deal, like we did with Lasergen. We see something that\\'s not out there we don\\'t have. But in general, we want companies with existing customers and revenue that will make a nice run to the company\\'s portfolio. Got it. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, Didier, on the margin outlook. When you guys brought the 22% op margin target in for the year, it\\'s still kind of sell. I think that was a number that you thought you were capable of doing if things went well. So I guess just given the top line momentum and the progress in terms of the operational stuff, is it right to think about that now? I mean, do you see upside of the 21.5% midpoint for the year just given the trajectory? Yes, we had -- I had explained back in November the reasons why we had reduced kind of the guidance from 22% to 21.5%. It was related to 3 factors. But I also pointed out that, internally, we set our performance metric -- internal performance metric be at risk at the same 22% that we had long talked about. So we do feel that there is a -- we have a shot at it and we were willing to basically put our be at risk there. And since then, we have had some good momentum. And -- but we are absolutely -- it\\'s not yet ready to obviously declare the victory there. That was interesting, I think. But reflecting back at our first Analyst Day, we put out 3-year goals of 5% core growth and 22% operating profits. We\\'re at the 5% core growth, and we\\'re hoping to find a way to get to 22%. And as Didier mentioned, that\\'s a standard where we\\'re holding ourselves to inside of the company. I just have a quick one on your free cash flow guidance. It looks like you guys left that unchanged. And given the guidance raise on revenue\\'s quarter, do you think that may go up? Could you talk about why there\\'s really anything not unchanged? And what\\'s going on with the cash flow? Yes, it\\'s a fair question. Obviously, the operating profit is only one of the manufacturers that we look at in the operating cash flow or free cash flow. Similar to, I guess, the answer to the previous question, we do see a path for a higher operating cash flow than what we have guided at, but we\\'re not yet ready to commit to it. This is actually Bill on for Paul. Just one question for you guys. CrossLabs for the past 4 to 8 quarters has been growing high single digit organically. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that is coming from customers looking to outsource or services for new products? And maybe some -- what are some opportunities to maybe continue to grow that? And then are you seeing some gains in market share as well? Yes, so thanks for the question. I\\'m going to make a few initial reminder comments of how we set up the company, and I\\'m going to pass it over to Mark for some specifics. But I\\'ve been going back to this trip down memory lane a bit, if you will. And 2 years ago, when we set up the company, we formed CrossLab Group. It really did change our view of the addressable market for the company. We said not only do we want the Agilent install base, but we should view the whole lab ecosystem as the opportunity for Agilent to provide value to our customers. And we also thought there\\'s some -- starting see some fundamental changes in terms of demand that there\\'ll be some outsourcing from companies such as Big Pharma that were looking for new -- for somebody to take on some of their internal activities. And I think that\\'s happened. It is happening. So Mark, why don\\'t you kind of build on the story and also talk about how we\\'re doing relative to our wins in the market? Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question. I\\'ll try to be as specific as I can. You asked the question about how much of this is based on outsourcing, it\\'s difficult to say. But I think if you look at the trends in pharma and even some of the recent studies down there, there\\'s an increasing work to outsourcing as I go for with the area for optimization. I don\\'t think it\\'s accelerated necessarily, but it\\'s still out there. I would say in our case, we\\'ve had a broad focus on the lab operations side and bringing all our components together as complete solutions. And I think that\\'s what\\'s really driving a lot of our growth, is how we\\'re coming together as more of a partner and consulting on how to get the most out of those lab operations. And competitively, looking at this is at a growing market, are we gaining share? The answer, I think, simply is both. And -- or executing well on the ground in terms of our sales teams across the globe. We\\'re also seeing just our increasing portfolio that goes towards this multivendor area. Hopefully, that helps. That does. And Mike, maybe just one quick one on capital allocation. As you think about share buybacks, dividends and with $1.80 net cash, how do you think about what\\'s the optimal strategy for Agilent in terms of leverage or lack thereof? Well, we think that we\\'ve been describing it as a balanced capital allocation policy, where our primary use of cash is to invest in the business. We talked about M&A a bit already today, but also the investment in our new facility in Colorado. So we\\'re going to use our cash for -- primarily for investing in the business, but we also want to increasingly grow our cash dividends. So you see every year, we\\'ve been bringing up our cash dividend, and we\\'re also using our leverage capability to actually buy back shares. So the share repurchase program that was announced when I came in as CEO actually was financed through debt. So -- and we like to keep some -- our debt capacity available for M&A as we would see, and we\\'re quite conscious of maintaining the investment grade level rating on our debt. So I guess, long -- or short of it is no change from the strategy we\\'ve been pursuing for the last 2 years. Within pharma, you\\'ve talked about small molecule customers going to a replacement cycle, any updated thoughts on how much longer that has left? And then can you break out what you saw from small molecule versus biopharma in the quarter? Yes. So I think, Patrick, your opinions. I won\\'t go into a baseball analogy, but I think we\\'re -- I won\\'t ask you for the innings. But I think we\\'ve always believed we\\'ve had at least another 18 months or so of higher demand. By the way, there\\'s always a replacement cycle going on. We have just been in the accelerated one going on in pharma as it relates to chromatography. We think that we may be seeing the earlier signs of that same thing happening in gas chromatography, but we\\'ll still wait and see on the sidelines for that. Relative to the -- to mix between small and large molecule, I think it\\'s fair to say that the -- both have been growing quite strongly, but the growth in biopharma is at a higher rate than the small molecule, albeit, a smaller part of our mix. Historically, we\\'ve been about 85-15, I guess, between small molecule and large molecule. About 80-20, sorry. Yes, 80-20. And we\\'re putting a lot of investment and focus on the biopharma space. So we talked a lot in my call about some of the new solutions, and it\\'s also been a major area of emphasis in terms of investment in our channel as well. Okay. And then looking at the economic end market. Can you quantify what growth was across the different geographies and remind us of your exposure by geography in that end market? So while Didier is looking for his notes, I\\'ll just say this is the one part of the end market where the pitcher has continued to be quite challenged. The funding level share globally, with perhaps the exception of China, have been fairly weak. But why don\\'t you provide some of the breakout? No, I\\'ll just say it was throughout the world, we saw year-over-year kind of a reduction with the exception mostly of us -- Japan but on the small base, and that surprised us. And there is not much we can wriggle of that because it\\'s on the small base, and parts of -- other parts of Asia Pacific. But the big markets, Americas and Europe, were weak. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the floor back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. All right. Thank you, Karen. And on behalf of the management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call on Investor Relations, and thanks again.

Q3 marked another strong quarter for the Agilent team. We exceeded our own expectations on both the top and bottom line. We continue to deliver above-market growth. Our revenues of $1.11 billion grew by 7.5% on a core basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.59 is up 20% over last year’s third quarter. Our focus on operational excellence continues to pay-off. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 21.5%, up 90 basis points from a year ago.  I can remember when I became Agilent’s CEO, you asked me a very good question, could Agilent make the adjustments to improve our operating margin while outgrowing the market? Well, we have. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of improving core operating margins while outgrowing the market. So where is our strong Q3 growth coming from? From an end-market perspective, both the global Chemical & Energy and Pharma markets grew by 10%. And geographically, China continues to be strong, while we experienced better than expected growth in Europe. Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening in our end-markets. Our Pharma revenue is up 10%. We are well-positioned to capture growing customer demand with our broad and differentiated offerings of instruments, services and consumables. Demand was also strong for our API offerings. Chemical & Energy is up 10%. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Similar to last quarter, growth was broad-based across regions and products. Our customers are beginning to upgrade their labs and are investing in equipment replacements. While some uncertainty remains on the pace of recovery, we are encouraged by the reinvestment.  After four consecutive quarters of decline, we had a nice surprise with the low-single digit core growth in Academia and Government. Strength in Europe and double-digit growth in cell analysis, spectroscopy and services drove our results. Food grew 2% against a difficult compare in Q3 last year. Food market fundamentals remain sound with strength this quarter in Europe. Environmental and Forensics grew a healthy 7%. Our strong growth was driven by Asia Pacific and the Americas. Concerns about the health of our environment continue to drive the Asia market. Diagnostics and Clinical grew by 6%, led by pathology and companion diagnostics and geographically, strength in Europe. Now turning to look at our different regions. Geographic performance was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and continued China performance. The Americas grew by mid-single digits, while Japan was flat. And now let’s turn to the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 7%. From an end-market perspective, strength in Chemical & Energy, Pharma and Environmental continue to drive the performance. Looking at our product portfolio, growth is broad across all our products. And we continue to strengthen our line-up. We recently introduced several new additions to our InfinityLab LC series. At ASMS, we unveiled our newest LC-MS triple quad, the Ultivo. It is not an exaggeration to say it’s revolutionary. The Ultivo is 70% smaller than previous instruments, yet it still delivers the same or better performance than its predecessor. Our customers tell us that the triple quad is the workhorse of the lab. The Ultivo allows our customers to maximize their lab space and increase capacity without compromising performance or uptime. This revolutionary new instrument is a great example of Agilent’s market expertise and commitment to customer-centric innovation. We also strengthened our GC-MS line up with the introduction of a new high-resolution, accurate-mass system. This new product will help our customers address the growing demand for identification of unknown chemical samples. We look to buy businesses in fast growing, adjacent market segments with differentiated offerings and strong teams. In July, we completed the acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems, adding Raman spectroscopy to our spectroscopy line-up. Cobalt Light Systems has developed ground breaking technology that is integrated into an innovative suite of benchtop and handheld instruments. We are now directly participating in this fast-growing spectroscopy market segment. There are strong synergies between the two companies. We are scaling the operations of Cobalt Light Systems and will be offering our current customers these ground-breaking solutions. CrossLab, a key strategic move of the New Agilent, continues to pay-off. The Agilent CrossLab Group maintained its strong performance again this quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Growth was robust for both services and consumables. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Results were driven by strong demand for our pathology products and companion diagnostics services. We see particular strength for our PD-L1 and molecular products. As I mentioned earlier, our Nucleic Acid Solutions business, which can be lumpy, performed well and is up by very strong double digits. The growth we saw in our Pathology business is a strong sign that we are regaining market share with our automation system, OMNIS, and the new products we are continuing to introduce. From special stains to new ready-to-use antibody offerings, our Pathology Division is creating a lot of momentum. We also introduced our newest next-generation sequencing library prep solution, Agilent SureSelectXT HS. This research solution benefits our customers by streamlining the entire NGS workflow. On the M&A front, we acquired the molecular and sample barcoding patent portfolios of Population Genetics Technologies. This expansion of our IP portfolio bolsters our target enrichment leadership position enabling the future introduction of new solutions to our customers. Rapid integration of the Multiplicom business continues to proceed according to plan.  Let me close out my portion of the call, recapping the journey of the New Agilent and with some comments on our Q4 outlook. In May of 2015, at our first analyst and investor day of the New Agilent, we laid out an ambitious three-year plan to create shareholder value. We made three commitments. We committed to outgrow the market. We committed to improve adjusted operating margins over 400 basis points. We committed to take a balanced approach to deploying our capital. Over the past 10 quarters we have been delivering on our commitments. I am so proud of this team. We are on the cusp of achieving the goals that we set for ourselves that we first shared with you over two years ago. We are a team that delivers on its commitments. I think it is now time to retire the description New Agilent. We have put in a new foundation for the company to grow and we are firmly focused on the future. The achievement of these goals is just the beginning. Our story is a forward-looking story with a laser focus on delivering superior earnings growth and creating shareholder value. Looking at the more immediate future, I want to close with a few comments about Q4 ’17. First, we remain somewhat cautious about the potential for a cyclical recovery. We also know we are heading into a period of tough compares for our global Pharma and China businesses. Yet, the overall market environment for Agilent is stronger than forecasted coming into this year. Given these considerations, we are once again raising our full-year core growth and earnings expectations. I look forward to answering your questions later in the call. I will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q3 results and updated guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, both on a year-over-year basis and versus our guidance. Currency had a positive impact on revenue and operating profit of respectively $7 million and $1 million versus previous guidance. Please also note that we have reduced our pro-forma tax rate by 1 percentage point, which had a $0.02 impact on our Q3 EPS.  I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion and EPS of $0.60 to $0.62. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 3.5% on a core basis. As a reminder, our core revenue growth last Q4 was a strong 6.3%, so Q4 is a tough compare, coming after an easier Q3 compare. Versus previous guidance, currency is estimated to have a positive impact of $24 million on revenue and $4 million on operating profit. Finally, our 22.4% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 90 basis points sequentially. Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. The Q4 guidance is expected to result in the following fiscal year guidance. First at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 6.0% on a core basis, or 1 percentage point over the previous guidance. The revenue guidance of $4.445 billion is $75 million over previous guidance including $31 million due to currency and $1 million due to M&A. Second, our EPS guidance of $2.30 at midpoint is up $0.12 from previous guidance and corresponds to a 16% year-over-year increase. Currency contributed $0.01 and the reduction in pro-forma tax rate contributed $0.03. Third, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 21.8% or 110 basis points higher than in FY16. And last but not least, we have raised our operating cash flow guidance from $825 million to $850 million and we are reducing our CapEx guidance from $200 million to $185 million, this leads to an increase in free cash flow guidance of $40 million. Didier, in the DGG business, a bit of quarterly variation of the op margin line. Where do you think the op margin settle in if we just look out a bit maybe past the current year, is there a range you kind of help us with there? Yeah, you\\'re right. The DGG business can be a little lumpy on an operating margin basis for many, many reasons. What\\'s important is that we came from you know we were coming from 13% operating margin in 2015 to 16% in 2016. And we are aiming still as we have basically announced back two years ago to close to 20% in 2017. So the range I would say after we complete this fiscal year will be around 20% that we\\'ve talked about. And Jacob, I don’t know if you want to add anything? And then Mike maybe just on chemical and energy, could you just put a little color to what you\\'re seeing inside that business. Obviously the unit is always doing better. Just curious what the commentary on exploration sounds like at this point. Are you expecting to finish the year sort of on a similar note or might we see some pick up towards the fourth quarter. Sure Dan. Maybe first of all I want to reground some of the segments because I think probably last five or six maybe seven quarters I would describe a certain breakdown of the chemical and energy along the lines of energy refining and chemical. And as you know we\\'ve been under - the energy sector has been under a lot of pressure last two quarters. So right now our estimates are that energy represents about 10% of the - excuse me, thank you Patrick, exploration I got mixed up here, exploration represents about 10% of the total, where refining is about 30% and the chemical side is about 60%. So just to kind of ground yourself there\\'s less of our business now in the exploration side of the business. We actually expect that to continue to be down for the remainder of this year. So we\\'re not really seeing much going on there. What we are seeing is what I pointed into in my script is that there\\'s been a high emphasis on cash management and cash control in prior years. We’re starting to see a little bit of money being freed up to focus on reinvestments and really to drive productivity and back to the small recent article in Wall Street Journal talking about the importance on customers, companies driving towards increased earnings. So what that tells us is that energy - the exploration side of the segment is going to continue to be down. We expect replacement to continue in the chemical side. We are still cautious on the refining side of the business. In fact you may have recently seen that the next 12 months EPS forecast for large cap and refining companies have declined since May. So it\\'s not all going well in the segment, but overall we\\'re encouraged by the results. So only two quarters of strong growth, so we\\'re not yet ready to call a cyclical turnaround. But I would remind you that for the year we\\'re forecasting overall 8% growth for this chemical energy segment, a much different result than you’ve seen in the prior two years. So hopefully that helps get at your question. What\\'s your general sense for how much of the strength you saw this quarter was overall end market strength versus strength of some of the new products that you\\'ve launched? Hey Tim, thanks for the question. So as you know our whole model is built around outgrowing the market based on a real focus on innovation that matters to customers tied to really a solid go to market channel. So I think what you\\'ve got going on is sort of a perfect storm if you will from a standpoint of, we\\'re able to put up these very strong growth results because we have a highly competitive and differentiated portfolio. So we know we\\'re gaining market share in a growing market and that really leads to the kind of results that we\\'re having here. So I know all CEOs claim to be gaining market share, but we look at the numbers that seem to prove out for us. And then could you maybe just comment on the runway for CrossLab, is that something where you still feel like there is multiple years of above market growth? So I’ll make some initial opening comments here Tim and then I\\'ll invite Mark to take a bow in terms of the results we’ve been pushing up here and talk about the future. So as I commented in my script this was a major strategic initiative for us to really go after this, what we see to be a new market for us in CrossLab, so I think much broader about our offering in the lab and really to focus on enterprise services and we think about the entire lab as our opportunity. We\\'ve had a number of quarters of very strong growth and our view is that we can expect to see this growth continue. And I point out to you some of their markets which historically haven\\'t been big purchase of service for example, are really driving a lot of growth for example, we had stellar results once again in China. So Mark, why don’t you give your thoughts about the future of the CrossLab group and can you sustain this run here on. Oh thanks Mike and hi Tim. Let me elaborate a little bit on Mike\\'s comment and a lot of attention comes around our enterprise solutions business. And that is a big factor behind our growth. However, want to peel that back a little bit. The instrument service business is much larger been growing in high single digits that’s enabling workflows and certainly complimentaring a lot of the new product technologies we’re bringing to market and the consumables business is routinely growing in the mid to high single digit range too. If I look ahead though we see a very robust market for the enterprise business in particular in pharma and increasingly inside the commercial labs and serve across multiple end markets, they can be environmental, food et cetera. And so, I don\\'t think there is any end in sight when it comes to the challenge of improving the productivity of the lab operations and that\\'s really where our value proposition is build upon versus single sourcing can we truly help you get the efficiency of the lab going out. So very bullish about our runway in this business going forward and I’d say it’s more than just enterprise service story, it\\'s really about our instrument service business and our consumables rounding out the entire picture. Mike, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the performance in biopharma in this quarter, specifically the trends you\\'re seeing at US pharma and then maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the commentary related API and the offering there. Sorry about that Jack, they say your hearing is one of the first things to go when you get older. Let me start with the biopharma comment and then Patrick I’m going to have you jump in and give your view on the dimensions by geography. But, we’re really pleased although we don\\'t report externally the absolute results in the biopharma segment of the pharma market. We\\'re really pleased with how this business is performing. As you may recall this is a major strategic initiative that we launched probably about two and a half years ago to really go after the biopharma market segment in a much different manner. We\\'ve been bringing to market a number of new novel solutions. We\\'ve changed our go-to market strategy and it\\'s paying off. So what I can tell you is we grew double digits in biopharma in the third quarter. We think we’re outpacing the overall market and perhaps you have a view of mix by geography and then anything else you want to add Patrick. Yeah, sure thanks Mike. So we have seen a very, very strong growth in China. We have seen reasonable growth in EMEA and Europe, and also a single-digit growth in AFO. So that\\'s the distributional regional level. And it\\'s heavily driven of course by biopharma as Mike mentioned because that is growing ahead of the global pharma space, but I would say if you look at the difference segments in pharma, it\\'s on the R&D side as well as manufacturing [indiscernible] very well represented there. And we don\\'t see a real slowdown right now in the biopharma space. So looking forward given the new portfolio we have, also the focus on complete workflows that we launched over the last couple of months, we\\'re pretty confident that we will continue to grow strong in this market and capture more share. So on the API side, our nuclear acid solution division, we see a lot of great momentum in the business and we continue to really be in situation where capacity is our main constraint. So that\\'s also why we right now as we\\'ve explained before we are building this new manufacturing capacity out in Colorado and Boulder, to really make sure we can expand versus the demand that’s out there. We have seen - as a goes in this business, we did see a few quarters ago that one of our customers did not meet the end point in a phase 3 clinical trial and that has led us to rebuild the pipeline. We have seen very strong demand and we’re really back in full swing again.  And then clearly you know a lot of new product launches coming on the mass spec side. I was wondering if you have any thoughts related to pushing mass spec into the clinical setting, a couple of your peers are pretty active there. I was wondering if that was a future target for Agilent as well. So I\\'ll take that Mike thank you. So, as you know we\\'re currently present in the LTG space, we launched class one product several years ago and this is what we see as the sweet spot right now for LCMS and clinical, it\\'s really all about pain management, vitamin D testing and all that application, immunosuppressants. And we are pretty well represented in that space right now, whether it will be able to replace immuno assays as some of our competitors might think, we have some question marks there, we think we are pretty strong in the LTG markets that might continue, we see actually probably more promise on the more sophisticated assays that are related to metabolomics and that are more later spaced of cancer diagnostics and more complex diseases like Alzheimer\\'s a couple of years out. So this is where we see the focus for this business because getting into in a clinical workflow where the light based assay are established and trying to replace those, will be quite difficult I would say. My question on maybe just the longer term outlook on margins, wondering if you can comment a little bit as we think about the framework for next year. Could you get a similar level of margin improvement in other levers, whether it\\'s pricing or improving R&D efficiency that you can kind of point to as we think about the margin set up for next year. Thanks Tycho, I appreciate the question. And what I\\'ll do is I\\'ll refer you back to the messaging that we provided in our last AID. So what we committed to was greater than 22 as we move forward. And we think we\\'ve got a model which allows us to continue to improve our operating margin and it\\'s going to a combination of a number of things you mentioned already, which is the innovation focus, making sure that we\\'re pricing for value, we’re managing on discounts correctly. So we have an initiative underway, we call the PDQ a pricing and discounting quote initiative to really make sure that we\\'re managing the price envelope correctly. I other thing I would point to is also the great work that our order fulfillment team has been doing. So when we form the new company we centralized all the manufacturing logistics, a material procurement in one organization and they\\'ve been doing a very nice job. And we think that the transformation is underway in our supply chain, it currently allows us to have some cost reductions in the future. So won’t commit today in the call to a specific number, but we like improving operating margins without sacrificing growth that was my one of the key parts of my script which says, hey we\\'re going to outgrow the market while improving operating margin. So that will continue be our model. And as we look forward and you can expect us to try to sustain levels of success we\\'ve enjoyed so far. And then question on Intuvo, I understand you\\'re generally not calling for a cyclical chemical and energy recovery, but if we think about just the sales cycle, can you maybe talk as to how it\\'s tracked versus initial expectations. How long [indiscernible]. Glad to, we\\'re always happy to talk about Intuvo and we also have the Ultivo. So it is getting a little - can be a tongue twister at times, but Patrick why don’t you update the colors on what\\'s going on with Intuvo. Yeah absolutely, where we\\'re very happy with the feedback we receive from the installed base after instruments we have shipped so far. Customers are really excited about the performance, robustness and ease of use of this product. That said, we\\'re not yet shipping it in really big bulk orders. As we said in the calls, last quarter and the quarter before is we think that will happen more in fiscal year ’18 when customers had enough time to test the instruments and also assign budgets to these instruments moving forward. I think that was a learning for us Patrick, which is we thought we had - we were in sort of a window with a. September launch, but we really - what we found out from our customers that we really didn\\'t have time to plan for this in their 2017 budget. Absolutely, actually, we launched September last year and the feedback we got from several - lots and lots of accounts was well very nice instrument, we didn\\'t have the time to really plan for the budget for fiscal year ’17, but we are now getting feedback from those that are certainly in the budget for fiscal year ’18. Again, the feedback is very positive. It’s still early in the ramped volume of this product but we are really excited about the excitement it drives also across the other products we have out there. We\\'re clearly seen as the market leader on gas chromatography and go to company. And then just one last one on academic, looks like Europe is being the driver there. Any comments on the US market, are budgets freeing up a little bit here from what you’re seeing? Tycho, when we looked at some of the numbers and talked about as a team, we said listen, what we really seen is, our growth, which is a nice surprise for us in the third quarter really was our market share gain story. So we\\'re still not seeing a lot of active funding going on in the marketplace. And I think US still seems to be fairly subdued and Patrick I don\\'t know what your thoughts on that, but I think we\\'re not that bullish on the overall market environment. We do think we\\'re able to pick up some growth here given that we\\'ve historically been under represented in terms of share, but the market is still not very robust. Agreed yes, definitely the US is not very robust. We have seen some upticks in Europe in the last quarter which helped to drive growth. And we think we are very well positioned with our portfolio. We also have a dedicated program within the company to really look at our coverage model for academia and government. And as Mike said, it\\'s all about taking market share from other competitors and this is what we are after. I think that\\'s maybe something that I should have mentioned earlier Tycho, as part of our channel strategy changes we made when I came in as CEO, we really cater a dedicated focus on academia and government. So I think perhaps they’re starting to see some payoff for those early investments now. Can you talk about some of your initiatives that are on developing like your oligo expansion? And also my follow up would be your thoughts on, is Asia getting better or is the same specifically China? And relative to the oligo expansion, in fact a few of us are heading out there tomorrow to see firsthand, we\\'ve seen pictures of the building, but there is nothing like seeing it firsthand. So we have going out and spent some time with the team, we’re expanding in Frederick, the construction schedule is going right according to plan. I think, Jacob, we’re looking, probably looking like more still FY ’19 revenue. 2018, the factory will be done, but there will be a validation process required. And the reason why I asked Jacob to talk about some of the customer activities because we still see a credible amount of demand for customers and it\\'s been more of a capacity constrained kind of growth challenge for us. But we\\'re fully committed, we\\'ll see firsthand and I’ll have some more in-depth comments when I talk to you next, but the construction schedule and the go-to market is still per plan. And then relative to China, and overall Asia, so I think about China, China continues to develop just as we have forecasted. I think we\\'re a little bit over double digit through the first three quarters, we thought it would to be a double-digit grower for us in 2017, seen no signs of slowdown there. I think what has been a nice surprise is the other countries in Southeast Asia that\\'s been a very fresher growing market for us. You may recall about a year or so ago, lot of concerns about the impact of the currency side of those countries. And inside Agilent, we call it SAPK which is South Asia Pacific and Korea and we\\'ve been putting good growth up in that part of the sector much higher than we had in prior years. I would say that Japan is the one where the market is still sluggish. Although we’ve been able to have about a 6% growth rate over the last two quarters. So that\\'s probably the most challenge of all the Asian markets we play in. I don\\'t know whether you count India in Asia or not, it\\'s managed in Agilent by our European team, but India market also continues to be quite strong. So I think Asia is going to continue to be a growth story, not only for 2017 but into ’18 as well. What\\'s your primary most important element do you think behind your market share gains, is it CrossLab or the tuck-in potential situations like Cobalt? I think it\\'s really, if I’d step back from it, I think it\\'s both a combination of how we’ve been able to broaden our portfolio tied with a true customer focus. And I know you hear it all the time, but we really try to think about what matters to our customers and then aligned our business strategies behind us. So we\\'re only doing great science and driving innovation with some of the new instrumentation that we\\'ve been inducing. But as we mentioned earlier, we’re really helping our customers with what we call the economics of the lab and that\\'s really the CrossLab. So I think we\\'re getting share in both places. And I think it\\'s been that combination of how we architected our, you know, so architect if you will our portfolio strategies. And I can also over emphasize enough the importance of having the right go to customer sales model. And we’ve made some pretty big changes the first year of the new Agilent. And we\\'re now I think starting to see the benefits of that, which is to have a really tight set of customer relationships tied with a broadening portfolio with a much clearer economic value proposition via CrossLab. Just on Dako if I could ask, with the Omnis rollout happening here and you mentioned Quest contract earlier, was that a contribution in the quarter and how should we think about this pull through from these boxes in the back half of the year once they start getting out there. And I know Jacob would love to talk about the overall pathology results for the quarter and then maybe go in specifically to the question around the impact of Quest and timing it may have on our business. Yeah, thanks for that and we are very pleased with where we are with our Dako Omnis business today, where we really see a very strong momentum, a continuous momentum with the business. Clearly we were very pleased with the win of Quest being the primary vendor here, which we announced I think it was last time, we are still in the progress of installing our solutions on several Quest sites. So we haven\\'t seen any contribution from Quest in this quarter and we’ll start to see it coming in the next quarter. But it\\'s primarily a fiscal ’18 view - situation that we would start to see Quest coming in. So right now, our pathology business is really driven by everything else we\\'re doing out there and Quest is just a part of the story. It\\'s a great part of the story but we just do see strengthening in all parts of geographies right now. And then second one on just the pharma growth, obviously strong in the quarter. So if you look at the pharma CRO and the CDMO accounts, what\\'s your sense of sustainability here? What\\'s driving it, is the bio molecules, I mean I suppose they\\'re using a number of products through the LSAG segment. What gives you the sense that these customers are continuing to see growth in bio molecules here. As we’ve heard from few other competitors, there was lumpiness in that segment. I know that some of our competitors reported that, but that\\'s not what we experienced and Patrick you want to... I agree, but this is not what we\\'re seeing right now. And part of it is again the solutions we brought out, the new solutions that helped drive the business there that really focused on the biopharma space. The molecular antibodies, there is a new software solutions out there for biosimiliars like our [indiscernible]. I think we’re addressing the needs of his market space better and better. And this will drive for us more pieces moving forward. Especially I think the biosimilars is a market space that will continue to grow. I don\\'t expect a big slowdown in that area. And just last, quickly on China, are you still seeing benefit from the CFDA changes or this contribution, I mean obviously you have tougher comps coming up and you\\'re base is significantly larger in China. So what\\'s your sense of CFDA changes continuing to benefit versus the food environmental business. Yeah, thanks for that question. So we expect the food market to continue to be strong in China, explicitly called that out, I think we used the word food market fundamentals remain strong, growth rates actually a little bit lower for China in Q3 just because we’re coming off a 20% some compare from a prior year. But the money is there, the emphasis is there, it\\'s a critical government policy to continue to improve the safety of their food supply. A lot of work still to be done, so we\\'re expecting growth to still be there. Just want to dive into a little bit detail on what you\\'re seeing from one specific customer base within pharma. So it seems like the generic industry is getting weaker and the challenges are worsening there, at least for some of the public companies. Are you seeing any of that in your customer base yet or any of that in the purchasing patterns? No, I mean it\\'s definitely not growing at the same pace as biopharma did as you outlined here, but it\\'s still growing for us and we don\\'t see any material changes in the next couple of quarters. Yes, we will see tough compares because we have been growing so strong over the last six quarters or seven quarters in pharma, but the fundamental business in small molecule is also there. But if you can show a return on investment, so and I think that’s been one of the selling propositions for the new portfolio? When they\\'re under pressure, generic guys, they\\'re willing to invest because they can see it help serve their earnings profile. Yeah. The whole messaging is around productivity and efficiency gains and cost of ownership for the solutions and that resonates very well with this customer base. I’ll just add on. This is Mark. Obviously with the enterprise solutions business, I’d echo the same comments that Patrick and Mike have, we’ve the value proposition around the economics of the lab continue to resonate as they have more challenges. And then for my follow up, as I think about the 3.5% core growth rate for the fourth quarter, that would be the lightest core growth and I think it\\'s four or five quarters and how much of that would you attribute to a tough comp versus maybe some caution on the end markets versus just some plain old conservatism? So, let me add some color, then, you can add your comment as well, Didier. So when we look at the comps, they\\'re real. I haven\\'t done the math in terms of the X percentage, but pharma is our largest market. It grew 16% Q4 last year. China, which is our second largest geography, grew 27%. So the comp -- the tough compares are real and that\\'s been part of our guiding philosophy all this year, we\\'ve been calling that. Business remains robust, but we know we\\'re going into a period of tough compares. I would say relative to the chemical energy, what we\\'re saying here is business is going to be better than we initially thought it was going to be coming in this year.  We\\'re glad to see the strong growth last two quarters, but there are still some signs that say, let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves here. We\\'ve had -- 40% of the segment is still under pressure. The company\\'s earnings forecasts are projected to be down, so we just think that it\\'s right thing to be doing to not call for a cyclical turnaround just as yet. Maybe just that Europe, we\\'ve had double digit growth two quarters in a row and we also want to be a little bit cautious about extrapolating that number. If last quarter we had told you where we are focusing Europe to go 12% in Q3, I think, you would have crucified us and so it’s tough to adjust. We don’t want to extrapolate those kind of superb results for two quarters. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that initial feedback on an uptick of Ultivo Triple Quad and then just comment on your performance in LC/MS in general? Yeah. Catherine, I’d be happy to. Great question and when your question came through, there was a smile on Patrick’s face. I know he\\'s anxious to share a little more about what\\'s going on with Ultivo. Absolutely. So first, let me handle the Ultivo question and then return all of you on LC/MS and GC/MS as well. We think Ultivo was really to start is here at ASMS. When we introduce the product, it creates a lot of excitement among our customer base. They cannot wait to get the hands on the prototypes. That said, we will launch it anything before end of this quarter. So I don’t expect any revenue contribution in Q4 coming from Ultivo product itself. I think we’re very well positioned to run that product in fiscal year ’18 and capture the market opportunity, specifically in environmental and food application space, where this product is really front and center in terms of the specifications and the application domain.  So lots of excitement around there, but that’s not the only product we have launched at ASMS. We launched a new Infinity Single Quad solution. We have biopharma solution and we launched a new GC solution that will all again drive the momentum behind mass spectrum and solutions. There is strong selling and we’re very optimistic about the future of this product line, the technologies and the focus we have on customer applications, as it creates a lot of excitement and we see that also in the growth rates, all of that in Q3. And then I wanted to spend a little time on the Cobalt acquisition. Can you just walk us through your thought process there, revenue run rate and then what kind of growth you think you could get out of that business? Sure, Catherine. So as I mentioned in the call, we’ve really been trying to find companies which in adjacent markets, which fill gaps in our current offering, but also have a differentiate offering and a very strong team and we\\'ve been trying to build out our spectroscopy business with a lot of success over the last several years, one hope was Raman Spectroscopy, which is arguably one of the fastest growing segments in spectroscopy. So we engaged the Cobalt Light Systems team early. In fact, just had a chance to spend some time with the leadership team here early today and I don’t think they’re yet ready to move to the next phase, but we got to them early, talking about joining the company, being part of Agilent and they really saw advantages to scale in the innovation focus that Agilent has. It’s a 50% plus company, about 10 million plus run rate and we think that, I think double digit growth, Patrick. I’ve got two for Jacob. One is a follow up on the SureSelect commentary. I wonder, as the discussion around that product portfolio has become bigger from Agilent over the last couple of years, if you could give us a little bit more granularity. Can you give us a sense for maybe how big that business is, how fast it\\'s growing, are you taking share, is it accelerating, can you talk about how the portfolio, including SureSelect and around SureSelect in library prep, sample prep, is contributing to the growth in DGG. Yes. So Steve thanks for that. And I’m very pleased with the new announcement of the SureSelectXT HS, which I think is going to really drive the business going forward. First of all, it will work very well with FFPE and with the molecular barcodes, you will also see that we will be able to really get very certain results on low, little frequencies. So I think this is exactly what the market is looking for. Overall, the SureSelect and our target enrichment business has been a success story for DGG and for genomics over last many years. It is a substantial part of the genomics business and it continues to grow in the double digit regime. I think we\\'ve seen the industry over the last few quarters that the market has at least taken a little bit of a pause, but we still show double digit growth of our business.  So it is -- I think we still are definitely keeping our market share out in the business. I\\'m not sure right now whether we’re taking market share, but we’re certainly keeping it and with the new SureSelectXT HS, I\\'m very convinced that we will start to see even stronger momentum again. I will say that SureSelect and where we’re going with all of this right now is our strategy is to become a whole workflow provider, where SureSelect is going to be a key part of that and SureSelect’s entry into that market. So clearly, it’s very important for us going forward, but we\\'re going to expand out both with the platform, our bioinformatics platform, but also with our Lasergen investments, we hope to be a full workflow provider in the future. The second thing I was hoping to just get a little color on is the new asset solutions market, the environment surrounding the investment in Colorado. On the last call, Mike gave us an update on the progress there. We talked about the potential for that to be a more material contributor to capacity expansion for fiscal ’19. Could you give us a sense for how big you think the relative opportunity is compared to how much business you\\'re doing there today and how much business are you just having to pass on because of that capacity constraint and how fast does it ramp? Yeah. Thanks, again, Steve and appreciate the interest in the [indiscernible] business, which is very exciting. Most of our costumers today are still doing clinical trials. So there\\'s a lot of investment and we continue to track the investment going into this market right now with this new type of drugs and there is a continued increased investments and we\\'re hopeful to see some of those clinical trials coming out into commercial products over the next few years here and that will create a substantial step up in the -- both in the expectations and also the requirements to our capacity. So I see that this could take it quite far over the next ten years, I would say, pharma does not go as fast as diagnostic, but you will see some step-ups every time we see some products going out and be commercial. So related to our current business, I think there is certainly an opportunity to substantially -- see a substantial growth going forward over the next five years and probably also next ten years. Yeah. I\\'ll just add one thing Steve. Right now, the business is about $70 million, $80 million and we are capped, we are operating at maximum capacity. And as Mike and Jacob mentioned, the new capacity only comes on board in 2019 and will add about $100 million after its full running state. So the ramp will be throughout fiscal year ’19, so fiscal year ’20, we’re talking about $100 million just with that additional business, but 2018 will be relatively flat with 2017, because we’re already at capacity of existing facilities. Mike, just a question on the M&A. At a high level, how you see the pipeline and if you could sort of elaborate on exactly what the Population Genetics deal does for you strategically and economically? Sure, Brandon. Happy to address both questions. Relative to M&A, we still see that there\\'s a pretty robust pipeline of targets out there, but not in the historic places where people are focused on in the US public sector. There\\'s a lot of very, very strong companies in Europe in the private sector as well as in the US and you may recall that in May, we had a new Head of Strategy and Business Development join Agilent and one of the priorities there is related to continue to find ways to make M&A more of a growth platform within the overall operating model we have to continue to describe for us in terms of how we want to use our cash and our balance sheet strength, I would say valuations are a little rich, so you have to be -- make sure you don\\'t get too far ahead of yourself in terms of what you’re willing to pay, but I think that there are viable targets out there, particularly for a company of Agilent’s size where we can acquire companies and really can make a meaningful impact ultimately in terms of our ability to grow.  The recent IP that we purchased, why don’t you talk a little bit about the strategic thought process, Jacob and the financials around it? Yeah. Absolutely. And the Population Genetics, PopGen is as Mike was mentioning an IP consideration and we’re very pleased to have that, which creates a very strong IP situation within molecular barcodes, where we see a very strong interest for molecular barcode is, I think, this is going to be very important is, first of all, most in liquid biopsies, but secondly also for what we call eliminating false positives that you see in NGS right now and especially going into DX, the diagnostic markets where you need to make sure that what you made sure is actually fully related to or correlated to actually the sample you’re having there and using those molecular barcodes ensures that you are very certain of what you measure is actually also there. So I believe actually that molecular barcodes is going to be required to really have a play in the diagnostic setting going forward and so I think we will be in a very strong position to really drive that market. One more for Didier, in terms of the CapEx outlook, the $15 million reduction, was that a pushout into ’19 and or excuse me ’18 and as far as next year goes, should we still expect a return to normal level of CapEx, call it, around 110 million, 120 million for next year? Yeah. It is indeed a pushout into ’18, but you will see ’18 will be lower than the number that we’ve just quoted for ’17. So we are returning to a more normal stage in ’18, but mostly it will be in ’19. I want to touch on two topics. The first is tax. You reduced your full year tax rate guidance, you\\'re on track to get to an 18% non-GAAP tax rate level well ahead of your prior expectations. Should we expect further tax rate reductions towards your, something like your much lower cash tax rate moving forward and if you could quantify anything there would be helpful. The second topic is on end markets and guidance. I was hoping that you\\'d be willing to share your assumptions for growth by end market and geography at least as they\\'re embedded into your Q4 revenue growth guidance. Thank you. Sure. Yes. Doug, yeah, you rightly pointed out that our new pro forma tax rate of 18% is way above our cash tax rate, which is less than 10%. So we do see opportunities, but it’s hard work. I’m not ready to commit now to like a, did not commit to a precise operating margin expansion number. I’m not ready to commit yet to a precise path, but yes, there is more opportunities and we’re working hard to identify ways to reduce our reserves, so that we can move closer to, I mean, move our pro forma tax rate down and it’s -- stay posted. Let me take the next one. Yeah. So I think if you look at our full year guidance, Doug, 6% core growth for the overall enterprise, we expect China to be right around 10% or so for the year. Overall, Asia around double digit with mid-single digit growth in Europe as well as Americas. So again, the Asia side of the business is expected to be the growth engine, as other geographies are expected to grow for us this year. And then when I look at, like if I find my notes relative to the, maybe you can help me. Thanks, Alicia. So when we look at the end market, again, the same 6% core growth.  Here, what we are seeing is I think about 7% to 8% range is I think what we’ve been talking about, about 8% for the year. As I mentioned, there are some caveats, still, there are some segments which still have some question marks. We’ve been very consistent with our view that pharma would go from its double digit grower that we had in ’16 to more high single digit. So you probably look in 8-ish pro forma for the full year, flat for academia and government and then high single digits for diagnostics and clinical and then food, environmental and forensics, low single digits. So the story here is – Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. All right. So Doug just took my question, so now I got to be creative. Thanks, Doug. So can we talk a little bit about pacing during the quarter? I mean, you do have an extra month relative to some of your peers on this, was July any different than May or June? I mean, any signs of potential unusual seasonality showing in the quarter? I think Derik, we don’t explicitly talk about our incoming orders in terms of where we finish, but what I can tell you is Q3 was like any other Q3 we’ve seen, so nothing really special about it besides the fact that it was an excellent quarter for the company. Okay. And when you look at your pharma business, I mean we\\'ve had a lot of questions about generic exposure and how much of your business is actually tied to the generics manufacturers in the overall pharma segment? Hey, I’m not as dumb as I look. So you did 6% core growth in ’15, 6% in ’16, you’re tracking to 6% this year, given a conservative Q4 guide. When we sort of look at the business and just looking where the segments are, I mean are there, is the mid-single digit sort of core growth rate on the business for next year is certainly a reasonable number to sort of think about as we start thinking about expectations. So, I’m going to kind of do a little kind of teaser for our November call. So I’ll hold the guide for November call. Didier is giving me hand signals on that one right now, but I think what you can see a consistent message is our ability, our model is all about outgrowing the market. So I think that’s what you can look for us to do and like I said earlier, we really, we return [indiscernible], foundation and the model that’s gotten us here, we’re going to stay with that model. But if you could just wait a few more months, I’ll have much more clear answer to your question. Wanted to come back to the industrial portion of the business and I think you covered some of the backdrop on energy, but interested in what went on in chemical this quarter, just talk a little bit about not just the growth rate, but also kind of your outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, obviously the commodity dynamic here may hold volatile, so interested in the chemical side of your business and how you’re managing through that. So just a reminder, we\\'re now going to be talking about a different ratio of the three segments that make up the generics space, given the climate we’ve over last two years in exploration side, so exploration is about 10%, it is about 30%. So if you will, the energy sector about 40%. The other 60% is what we call chemicals and materials. And that’s really been where, what the growth we’re seeing has been coming from. Some reinvestment in the refining side, but most of the growth has been on the chemicals and materials side.  What we\\'re seeing is, for the year, we’re forecasting, as I mentioned earlier to Doug\\'s question, we think we can probably do 8% or so for the year in chemical energy, which is remarkable turnaround given the fact that the prior two years actually had strong for us, but I can\\'t emphasize enough that there still are signs of caution, you may want to use the word conservatism, but I just say I\\'m just trying to be very pragmatic and think about what\\'s going on here and I’m saying, listen two good quarters of growth, okay.  Great. Let’s see how the next quarter shapes up and I keep coming back to 40% of that segment is still under pressure and our major customers here, those companies themselves are seeing a downgrade in their earnings forecast for the next 12 months. So all in all, a much better picture than we thought coming into the year, but still some reasons to be a little bit pragmatic in terms of how we view the future growth in Q4 and beyond. Maybe just second question would be on the DGG segment, since you guys didn’t do your annual investor meeting this year, I was hoping for a bit of a long term refresh on the strategy. You obviously have had good success with the guys didn\\'t do your show and you will. And that\\'s I mean if here I was hoping for a bit of a long term refresh on the strategy obviously had good success with the Dako asset, you talked about SureSelect and you\\'ve got obviously a lot of other investment and irons in the fire for NGS, I mean put that all together, how should we think about your appetite to invest strategically and organically in DGG relative to the rest of the company. I mean, it seems like there\\'s a good opportunity to add in to -- fill in some of the whitespace and I\\'m curious how high a priority that is? Yeah. We have a very large appetite in this space and a number of things have been happened. So if you look, Jacob has done a really excellent job in terms of addressing the fundamentals of the business, pathology business with double digit growth for us. When I first came in his role, a lot of questions about the future of the Dako acquisition, so we\\'ve got that. We get good growth there and we\\'re making a number of significant investments, both organically and inorganically. So a lot of our M&A has been focused in this area.  So whether it be the Multiplicom acquisition, Lasergen equity investment, the recent PopGen, so we have a lot of interest in this space. And as I mentioned earlier, not to put any pressure on Sam who happens to be in the room with me, but we brought in a new Head of Strategy and Corporate Development and really from the space, so we\\'re very interested in finding new ways for Agilent to grow in the space. We like the fundamentals of the market and we like our ability to take a bigger piece of that market. And just last question there is just given that it’s your small segment and the end market opportunities there are pretty vast, should we assume that will remain the highest growth segment in the company for the foreseeable future and just trying to put that all in context on the numbers? Well, I think all three group Presidents are fighting now to see who can grow them fast. So we think all of our business groups can grow. I think that there are some really unique fundamentals going on in DGG space which perhaps has a higher long term inherent growth rate on the markets. So we think they’re all going to be winners and maybe perhaps a little bit higher growth ultimately in DGG. Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Thank you, Crystal. On behalf of the management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us today.

I’m pleased to have an opportunity to continue to tell the Agilent story, a story of strong revenue and profit growth that we’ve been telling for the past three years. The Agilent team closed out 2017 with another strong quarter, capping off a tremendous year of revenue and profit growth. We again exceeded our growth expectations. Q4 revenues of $1.19 billion are up almost 6% on a core basis. Reflecting our commitment to improve as Agilent’s operating margins, our Q4 adjusted operating margin of 23.3% is up 80 basis points. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins. The strong revenue growth and margin improvements resulted in Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.67, an increase of 14%. Looking at the full year, we delivered a highest growth rate since the 2014 launch of the New Agilent. Our 2017 revenues of $4.47 billion are up 6.7% on the core basis. We have strong momentum going into 2018. Adjusted operating margin for the year is up 130 basis points over last year. And as you know, in 2015, I committed to increasing Agilent’s adjusted operating margin by 410 basis points over FY14’s adjusted operating margin to 22% by 2017. I’m pleased to announce that we’ve made this commitment and accomplished our goal. We are not done yet of course, but this is significant achievement by the Agilent team. We will continue to focus on making improvements in our operating results. The momentum in our business combined with our operational excellence drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year to $2.36 per share. Let me now take a minute or two to look closer what’s driving our stellar results. From an end market perspective, our chemical and energy revenue grew 15%. This was third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Growth was broad-based across the spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. We are encouraged by the uptake and reinvestment by our customers as they’re upgrading their labs and investing in next generation equipment. A return to growth accelerated in academia and government with 12% growth, which was above our expectations. Growth was broad based across product lines with particular strength in Europe and Americas. Our higher than expected growth has resulted in improved funding environment and market share gains. Food revenue grew 10% against the difficult compare of 10% in Q4 of last year. From a product perspective, the strength was broad based, led by services, consumables, mass spectrometry. Regionally, Europe and Asia drove the gains. Pharma revenue declined 5% against the difficult compare of 16% growth in Q4 of last year, which itself came on top of a 19% growth to Q4. We had been anticipating continued strong pharma investment levels with difficult compares slowing our reported market growth rates to mid-single digits. Some additional specifics of our Q4 results. As expected, the LC replacement cycle continues in this small molecule market segment, but at a slowing rate. NASD revenue also is down, as we expected. We noted in our Q3 call that NASD revenues are batch based which makes them vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of customer acceptance. Market demand however for the NASD API offering remains strong. Our product and geographic mix also contributed to the results. We experienced strong order demand from Europe and for higher end mass spectrometry technologies. The order to revenues cycle is longer for Europe in these types of products. We expect these revenues materialize in Q1 and Q2 of FY18. The biopharma segment of our pharma business remained strong along with services and consumables across the entire pharma end market. Diagnostics and clinical grew by 9% led by pathology and companion diagnostics. Continued strong end-market demand and market share gains are driving performance. Environmental and forensics grew 4%, in line with expectations. Concerns about the health of our environment continued to drive the market in Asia. Geographically, our Company results are driven by higher single digit growth in Europe and China. The Americas grew by mid single digits, and Asia excluding China and Japan grew by low single-digits. And finally, let’s turn to highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 4%. Market revenue was led by strength in chemical and energy, academia and government, and food, partially offset by declines in pharma. Double-digit growth in several platforms including mass spectrometry, microfluidics and cell analysis were key driver to reported growth. LSAG had a tremendous year on the innovation front, launching several new high-impact products such as the Ultivo LC-MS triple quad with a 70% smaller footprint than its predecessor. The Ultivo, which began shipping this November and other recent new product introductions are being well-received by the market. This gives us momentum going into 2018. The integration with recent acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems is going very well. Agilent’s CrossLab Group’s strong performance continued this quarter with 8% core revenue growth. Growth was healthy across services and consumables, most regions and end markets. Our CrossLab’s Service and Support organization hit a significant milestone, $1 billion in annual service orders for the first time in a single fiscal year. This milestone was accomplished ahead of our initial expectations. It validates our strategic focus on developing a service business for the entire lab. In a rather short period of time, our team has turned its services business into a key differentiated offering for Agilent. Through these services, we can as a strategic partner with our customers, helping them achieve greater lab efficiencies and outcomes. The customer response to our service offerings is overwhelmingly positive. Our chemistry business and ACG also continue to be awarded for technical innovation with double-digit growth in the AdvanceBio column portfolio for the fiscal year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong revenue growth of 7%. Demand is increasing for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We are seeing continued strength of our PD-L1 and molecular products. As expected, our new Nucleic Acid Solutions business was down for the quarter, given the product driven nature of the business. As previously mentioned, market demand for APIs for RNA-based therapeutics remains strong.  DGG achieved a major milestone this year, delivering a 20% operating margin exclusive of acquisitions for the first time. Three years ago, this business had a 13% operating margin; we have increased that to 20%, a tremendous achievement made possible by integrating and driving improvements in the former Dako business, bringing to the market compelling new offerings and executing on gross margin improvement initiatives. DGG continues to expand its market reach. We received several significant FDA approvals this quarter for offerings that help our customers in their efforts to fight cancer. We received FDA approval for expanded use of our PD-L1 cancer diagnostics for Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Opdivo. We have been closely collaborating with both companies. Our GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay received 510(k) clearance. This is our first comparative genomic hybridization assay approved by the FDA for diagnostic use. Our R&D advancements continue to yield differentiated and new products. At the American Society for Human Genetics Conference, we introduced our first expansion of the SureGuide pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This new offering will help accelerate research in the complex diseases and drug discovery. Agilent received the 2017 Scientists’ Choice Award for Best New Clinical Laboratory Product for the IQFISH Panel for Lung Cancer from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. This award is elected through online nomination and voting by scientists around the world. This demonstrates how we’re meeting our customers’ needs of products that win their trusts. Before touching on the 2018 outlook, I want to provide you with a perspective about our guidance philosophy and the market environment assumptions underlying our initial outlook. Later in the call, Didier will provide additional guidance specific. We entered 2017 thinking that China and the pharma market would be strong. We also pointed out at that time that we moved into a period of increasingly difficult quarterly compares for these markets. At the same time, we were uncertain about the outlook for Europe and the chemical and energy market. We closed out 2017 with China and the pharma market developing generally as expected; Europe and the chemical and energy market another hand exceeded our initial expectations growing 8% and 11% on a core basis respectively. We enter 2018 with a strong backlog and good visibility for the next one to two quarters. For the full year, we expect pharma to moderate down slightly from a 6% growth rate delivered in 2017. We expect China to maintain a high-single-digit growth rate. For Europe and the chemical and energy markets, while we experienced unexpectedly strong 2017 growth, we will cautiously guide to lower growth in FY18. A level of political and economic uncertainty persists across the globe, providing less visibility into second half 2018. We are taking a wait-and-see outlook for the European and chemical and energy markets. A few final comments about the next chapter in the Agilent story. 2017 was a stellar year for Agilent. We delivered our highest growth rate since the lunch of the new Agilent. We raised our operating margins 410 basis points in three years to 22%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 19%. While we’re busy improving our operating results, we’ve also been building the Company for the future. Our Agile Agilent program continues to streamline the Company as we upgrade our systems and infrastructure, and drive continued process improvements. We continue to build an even stronger portfolio through our revamped R&D programs and execution of our M&A strategy. We are delivering to the market truly differentiated offerings and augmenting our internal investments with acquisitions. These acquisitions are bringing to Agilent new capabilities and unique new offerings. We then leverage our Company scale to drive revenue and create cost synergies. Our one Agilent cultural transformation is changing the way we work, improving the customer experience; it’s a key driver of our excellent results. We’ve just completed the third year of our Company transformation. We now have a solid foundation in place, a proven track record of doing what we say we will do, and of executing winning a growth strategy. I often tell the Agilent team that the best is yet to come. We have momentum and I believe Agilent’s prospects have never been stronger.  Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Didier. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high-end of our guidance. We delivered core revenue growth of 5.8% and 6.7% ,respectively; and our operating margin was up 80 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively. Just as importantly, we reached the goal set in March 2014 to achieve 22% operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight in fiscal year 2017. Our full year EPS at $2.36 is 19% higher than the previous year. Our operating cash flow for the full year at $889 million is $39 million above the increased guidance provided last quarter and $96 million or 12% higher than fiscal year 2016, reflecting a strong overall performance. CapEx spending was $176 million, lower than our initial guidance of $200 million as some CapEx related to our new Nucleic Acid facility was pushed into fiscal year 2018. Turning to capital returns for the year, we paid $170 million in dividends and repurchased $194 million worth of shares. I’ll now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2018. Although we are comfortable with the present revenue and EPS consensus estimate, we believe as we did in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 that it is appropriate to have a cautious first guidance of the year. Our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance of $4.72 billion to $4.74 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on the October 31st exchange rates, and currency has a 1.3% positive impact on revenues. We project fiscal year 2018 adjusted operating margin of 22.2% to 22.7% and fiscal year 2018 EPS of $2.50 to $2.56, growing 7% at midpoint. If market conditions and our performance continue as strong as we are presently seeing, we stand ready to reflect the ongoing strength as we set quarterly guidance in the future. As you update your models for fiscal year 2018, please consider the following 10 points. First, annual salary increases will be effective December 31, 2017. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $72 million. As we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $31 million. Third, depreciation is projected to be $101 million for the fiscal year. Fourth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 18%. Fifth, we plan to pay $192 million in dividends, as the Board just approved a dividend increase of 13%. Over the last three years, we will have increased our dividend by nearly 50%. Sixth, as for buybacks, we registered 10b5-1 in September that includes two tranches with the maximum overall spend of $380 million. The first tranche is to ensure the repurchase of 2.7 million shares with daily execution throughout the year, to maintain our diluted share count at about 326 million shares on average for the year. The second tranche as in the previous years is opportunistic. Seventh, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed the diluted share count of 326 million, i.e. we have assumed that the opportunistic tranche does not get triggered. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $59 million, and other income at $14 million. Ninth, we expect operating cash flow of $970 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, which includes about $110 million to complete the new nucleic acid factory that will be operational in 2019. And tenth, the projected tax rate and cash flow exclude any impact from the potential U.S. tax reform. Finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.145 billion to $1.165 billion, and EPS of $0.55 to $0.57. At midpoint, revenue will grow 5.25% year-over-year on the core basis and EPS will grow 6%. At customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the strong loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please? So, can we you talk a little bit about the pharma results in the quarter. Just can you parse out the contribution or the lack of contribution from the NASD versus the European rev rec for us? And then, I’ve got a couple of follow-ups on that. Sure. Happy to do so, Derik. So, I’d point you to three comments on our Q4 results in pharma. The first, the one that we’ve been signaling for most of the year which is tough compares. We came off 16% growth in Q4 last year then we had 19% Q4 the prior year. Second piece is the revenue recognition timing, and I think there’s two aspects of that. One is the NASD business which we described in the call as really being a batch based business, kind of depends on when the customer wants to finish up the batch. But the overall market demand looks really good for these products. And then, as you are indicating, we had really strong results in mass spec and in Europe. And typically, we don’t -- they will be order results. Typically, we don’t talk about order, but we wanted to give you a sense of the strength of our pharma business in these areas and how it translates into revenue going into the first half of next year. The third piece would be that we are seeing expected slowing of the LC replacement cycle in small molecule side. So, those are three major drivers of our -- behind our Q4 performance in pharma. Just to remind, we ended up right on our full year guide. So, we came in at 6%, right where we thought we would in terms of pharma. To your specific question, I would say the bulk of the downward trend in the quarter had related to the LC replacement cycle and the shift in European business, probably less than 15%, 20% was NASD, right? And just following up on this. I mean, last quarter, people were sort of having questions about inventory destocking in the biotech and pharma just because there were some mix results. It seems like also a little bit of that this quarter, but not as pronounced. So, you are still not seeing anything other than tough comps that’s making nervous in terms of the pharma, biotech markets? No. In fact, that’s why we went on our way to give you some additional detail in this call, because fundamentals in pharma are still very strong. And then, the biopharma segment in particular has been a continued area of really strong growth for us, and we called that out in our script as well. The guidance for next year of 40 bps of operating margin expansion; you guys have obviously been trending above that; we have been modeling about 100 bps for next year. Just, is that all the offset in the API investment or are there other areas your reinvesting? So, I think the question related -- good afternoon, Tycho. And the question of Tycho was we’ve got about 40 basis points of improvement in our guide, he’d been modeling more like 100. Is the API, investments that are causing the gap? No, API had no -- the Nucleic Acid facility had no impact there. No, we just -- as we did last year at the same time, are cautious overall and have an operating margin that ties with our cautious revenue growth for the guidance. So, it’s consistent and hopefully we did the way, we did last year. And I guess also that Tycho very much like last year, I made the comment that the management team continues to have a goal on operating margin that is higher than the guide that we just gave you. And then, can you maybe comment on chemical and energy, where you are incrementally more positive? I think you said exploration is now growing; there are some nuances there you can call out. And as we think about a year ahead, how should we think about chemical and energy? Yes. Sure, happy to do. And then, I’ll let Patrick in the Q&A, if I missed anything. But, we actually -- we now have seen a much more broader based growth scenario across entire spectrum of the chemical and energy market. In prior calls, we only had been focusing on that 60%, which is the chemical side of that space. We’re now seeing reinvestment occurring also in refining as well as exploration. Anything to add to that, Patrick? You’re absolutely right. We see now really the pent-up demand is kicking in and we see the replacement, we see replacement coming as expected. Yes. So, we’re guiding to try probably mid-single-digit growth or 5ish next year for chemical, as I mentioned in my -- in energy, as I mentioned in my call script. We’re pretty confident about the first half and on a wait and see for the second half. And then last, when you increased the dividend, it was a small increase, small dividend. But, anything to read in that in terms of capital allocation, particularly as we think about the M&A landscape, your price are still pretty high? I think our strategy all along has been a balanced capital allocation policy, and part of that has been to continue to find ways to return cash to our shareholders and part of that formula for us has been increase in the cash dividends, up almost 50% over the last three. So, no read through on the M&A.. I think this is as more, I think a validation of our doing what we say we’re going to do. My question is actually on costs takeout and incremental margins. If we go back to the financial plan, introduce subsequent to the introduction of Agile Agilent program, introduce a series of plans, taking out some number of tens of millions of dollars cost per year. Some of those plans, going into 2018, 2019, and then more recently heard more about shared services savings. So, I wondered if you could give us a sense for relative to those objectives, how you’re thinking about, within the context of the guidance for 2018 and 2019, just succeeding on hitting those objectives where they would have an 2018, 2019 impact, are we assuming that those targets get hit, are we assuming that they don’t hit and we’re taking wait and see approach on execution? No, I think we’re really quite pleased with our ability to execute. I think three years ago when we laid out -- I think it was pretty audacious goal at the time to do 410 basis points. And you saw us through -- those following three years, how we through a constant drumbeat of execution were able to deliver on that 410 basis points. We have had same operational discipline today, it still exists and exists going forward. So, we have a whole series of plans inside the Company continue to sustain this ability to improve the operating margins. As you know, we’ve indicated at our prior AID that would be greater than 22 and this guide is consistent with that. But we’re quite confident in ability to hit the guide that Didier just gave you. Yes. And just, if -- we are very consistent, as Mike said, with what we stated last year. In fact, it’s amazing, because last year we provided our first guidance with 4 to 4.5%, exactly like this year in core revenue growth, and 50 basis points improvement in operating margin, which is same thing as this year. We ended by beating our operating margin first guidance by 80 basis points to 22%. And obviously… Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my other question relates to the buyback. You mentioned there are two tranches to the buyback; one, more maintenance, one, more as you say opportunistic. I wondered if you could spend a little bit more time on thinking around the buyback, the scale of the buyback. Balance sheet is obviously very strong. How you make the decision about whether you allocate more to the buyback or not or potentially expand it? Thanks.  Yes. As Mike stated, we do want to have a very balanced capital deployment policy, which we presented to the Board, both to support organic growth via CapEx to support inorganic growth, so to support business as well as dividends and buybacks. So, $380 million with the big chunk of that being automatic since -- in line with our balanced capital deployment policy. Yes. We’ve been talking on the rate scenario, about a percent of the outstanding shares, and that clearly would represent that. And then, as we mentioned earlier, our continued primary focus for the use of the cash and the strength of our balance sheet is invest in the business, either through M&A we think that makes sense, the right valuation; and then, as you know, we are investing fairly heavily on the CapEx side right now.  Yes. And if they would be more opportunistic as part of the U.S. tax reform to repatriate more cash, our intent would be to allocate it under the similar fashion and to maintain our present policy. Thanks, good afternoon. Didier, maybe start-up one for you. Could you walk us through your core growth assumptions for 2018 by segment as well as the SBUs, so sort of end market and between LSAG, CrossLab and DGG? Yes. Overall, we had our slowest growth, I would say for ‘18 which would be along academic and government, and environmental and forensics around 3%, and then the most important growth would be in diagnostics and clinical, not exactly the DGG, 6%; and the rest is in between so, you have chemical and energy… Okay. That’s helpful. And one for Mike. Curious to hear your thoughts on how you would characterize the quality of the R&D pipeline right now? And I think of late, you started implementing what you kind of referred to as a product cycle management system. Can you sort of walk us through exactly what is and whether there any P&L benefits associated with that kind of over time that we should expect? Yes, happy to answer both questions. I am going to invite again Patrick on the second as well he is the executive sponsor on our PLM program. But, we’re super excited by the strength of our R&D pipeline. And you may have noticed in my earnings call script, I talked about how we’ve revamped our R&D programs a few years ago. Now, you are seeing some great things come to market. And as I tell my team all time, we are not done yet. So, we have a nice rhythm of continued introductions we are planning over the next few years across all three groups. So, we are really pleased with how our teams -- the ideas we have but also our teams are actually executing on delivering to the market. And you are exactly right, I think we called this out in our last call, but we’re investing pretty heavily right now in a new -- it’s actually I think our first ever product lifecycle management system which really will give -- a new one, been a while I think Patrick. And this is really going to drive a lot of efficiencies in the R&D process as well as it’s going to drive continued reductions in cost of sales because of -- why don’t you share some of the details, Patrick? Thanks Mike and thanks for the positive comment on the new product. So, the focus of this program is really on improving R&D efficiency and new product introduction. The efficiencies that we will implement a new product lifecycle management tool, which takes really a lot of the manual processes we still have today, make sure that we’re in full compliance also on medical device side as we bring more and more products from neonatal [ph] business into clinical environment. And with this, focus on improving the tools and processes, we are really shooting for much higher throughput from our R&D program that we have potential [ph]. We are really pleased with the work we have and I would say we are definitely positioned well to continue capture market share by bringing more of these breakthrough products to the market like we did last year, as we did [ph], Ultivo product, [indiscernible], you name it. There is a whole suite of new products out there. We have a strong pipeline and I think it was time for us to update tools and processes in R&D as well and new product introduction, make sure that we get the best efficiency possible out of our engineering group. 2018 will be a year of investment. But, as you go out in the next few years, you can see reasons why we think we can continue to improve the effectiveness of our R&D investments as well as continue to lower our cost of sales. We are investing to make it happen. It’s not just hope and a prayer. Didier, based on your cash flow guidance, it seems like after backing out CapEx, dividends and the first tranche of buybacks to counter share creep that you’d still have over $350 million of cash flow to be deployed. And this is assuming you don’t beat your guidance which you characterized as conservative. Should we view the other $350 million plus in cash flow is being there for M&A and the opportunistic buyback you describe, what we should think of as at least the initial budget for those sources of cash? No. We look at the M&A on the standalone basis, so based on how much value we can create through those programs. We clearly are not limited by, for example, how much cash flow we will have left over from what we generate during the year. In any case, if it is U.S. M&A and there is a tax reform, we’ll have to borrow to fund the acquisitions. But, we have much larger financial capabilities in terms of M&A, and the number that you are quoting. And we have a very, very significant pipeline, all three presidents on a regular basis, present to Mike and me whole set of potential acquisitions. And that’s beyond the number that -- in terms of the number that you’re quoting -- you have quoted. Okay. And then, I guess, just as further clarification, if $350 million is isn’t towards M&A and you have the additional budget and additional sources for M&A as you described, where does that 350 go? Is that largely towards those opportunistic buybacks? It goes into outside of the U.S. The issue that we have dealt with on an ongoing basis is that we -- most of the cash that we generate, we generate outside of the U.S. So, if we intend to spend it in the U.S. -- and it is true that if we only spend “$380 million” this year and buy back, we still have opportunities the Board gave us back in May of 2015, larger allowance to use our three years. So, we do have an opportunity there to spend more money on buyback. But if we do that, it will have, it will be funded through increasing U.S. debt. And I just want to go back to -- I think it was Derik’s first question on pharma growth. Would you be willing to specifically quantify what pharma growth would have been excluding the NASD impact? And based on your comments on mass spec and European order results recognizing your commentary in your prepared remarks, is the expectation in guidance that those European and mass spec orders that you called out, turn into revenue in Q1 and Q2? Yes, happy to provide additional insights, Doug. So, the first piece is that of the 5% decline, we saw in Q4 2017 over Q3 2016, 1 percentage point of that came from NASD. The second piece of it is, will we expect to have the revenue show up in Q1 and Q2, yes, absolutely. So, these tend to have a three to four-month cycle from order to revenue. And like I said earlier, we don’t typically talk about orders, but we wanted to make sure that we make clear that the pharma business remains quite solid for Agilent and we have a nice backlog. Just maybe going back to the new product discussion. Obviously, a lot of focus on the Intuvo replacement cycle. Can you just maybe talk to how material you think contributions there are likely to be next year? I think it’s a very similar kind of story you’ve heard from us in the past. I think you’ll start to see increasing levels of direct contribution of that product to our top-line revenues. As you know, in the past, we’ve also talked about the halo effect it’s had on all the aspects, or I guess from a targeted portfolio as our product is just reinforced, who is the leader by far in this space. So, a lot of the growth in the chemical and energy space is being fueled by gas chromatography sales. So, we expect it to be a continually larger contributor to our growth. And as you know, that’s -- we’ve got our guide outside of the clinical diagnostics market. We have chemical and energy as our second strongest market next year in terms of our initial thinking for overall growth rate. And Intuvo is expected to be a contributor there. Okay, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up for you or Didier, just on the outlook. I believe the comment there was that you were comfortable with the consensus number for 2018. I mean, I guess if we were to think about you’re getting to core growth, it’s more like 6 and 4 next year. What businesses seem like most likely you’ve gotten in there, which -- where do you feel the segments are most conservative in the outlook? Thanks. Yes. I would just reemphasize a few points I made in my call script. By the way, I talked about in my narrative, kind of remind everyone that last year things turned out -- we’re just super pleased with how this year progressed, but there was some uncertainty last year. And things don’t always turn out exactly how you think, that’s why we’re taking a sort of wait and see, as it relates to the second half of the year for the Company. I think the two areas to keep an eye on, a little bit growth rates in Europe sustain at these unexpected levels we’ve seen over the last quarters and the other one is chemical and energy. So, I think those are the two watch ones for you to keep an eye on in terms of where the upside could be, if those growth rates continue at the same rate we’ve seen the past few quarters. I was just wondering if you could walk through some focus areas for DGG next year, be it expanding multiple comps offerings more globally or any new product launches to call out? Yes, absolutely. I’m delighted to give Jacob a question on this call. So, this is -- and again, we were just so pleased with the results for DGG this year. Team really hit a major milestone of achieving significant improvement in operating margin for the business and really think we’re seeing the benefits of how we’ve turned the former Dako business around. So with that, Jacob, let’s move away from the past and talk about the future? Yes. Thank you for that. And I see, as 2017 was strong, I continue to see also that 2018 is going to be strong, actually across all our five divisions, and you start out with Multiplicom. We have now integrated Multiplicom into Agilent infrastructure. So, we can now really take the full advantage of Agilent’s reach. So, I’m pretty pleased and I’m expecting a lot out of Multiplicom in 2018. But I see that also very much in a combination with our old technologies. We will of course continue to invest into the [indiscernible] which is the former [indiscernible] platform, combining our bioinformatics pipeline with our strong presence in target enrichment, Multiplicom being one but clearly also SureSelect and HaloPlex, that we speak a lot to the genomics. And our whole strategy will continue to be to move into the clinic and build a full workflow around our offering here. We continue to see strong growth in the pathology business where PD-L1 has been a great success story. But, really, also on this platform, it’s having a lot of momentum. So, I also continue to see a lot of traction in that space. And then, obviously, the NASD business, we see a lot of tailwind there. We are -- we will continue to be really limited by our capacities. Really pleased to see that announcements coming out in the market about the RNAi drugs getting close to commercialization and we start to see a lot of interest by lot of other pharma companies out there. Just wanted to take a step back and look at the pharma issue from more of a macro level. It does seem like the comments you’ve made all basically amount to a fairly material deceleration in pharma end market growth in 2018. And if I kind of think about the elements that you’ve called out, it sounds like maybe the replacement cycle in LC might be the driver of that. I guess, first question is that, is that the right way of thinking about it? And then, if so, what are kind of the macro things happening in the pharma end market right now that you might draw line to as the major factors there? Sure, Tim, happy to provide perspectives. First of all, I would actually characterize a little bit differently. I wouldn’t characterize it as a pharma issue. For the last 12 to 18 months, we have been calling this. We have been saying that when we think about the pharma market, think about two segments, small molecule and large molecule. Large molecule biopharma, very, very strong, continue to be very strong. There are still investments going on in the small molecule side but we’ve been saying that there is going to be a slowing of a growth rate because you get to the difficult compares and investment levels aren’t going to keep increasing at those 15%, 19% kind of growth rates. So, we actually don’t see it as a pharma issue at all. This is actually developing exactly as we had bought. That’s why I mentioned earlier that our full year guide last year had us 6%. And Didier I think we ended up pretty much close on 6% for the year. And then, there is some good fundamentals. I mean, there is the NASD business, which you know is batch based. We know that the demand is there for 2018. We’ve got very good demand for mass spec products in the pharma space. And then, if you look at the numbers, our ACG business continues to be strong, both on the services and consumables side. So, we actually don’t see pharma as an issue. We see it as continued area of strength for the Company. But we’ve been signaling for some time that there will be some moderation of overall growth rates in this segment, primarily because obviously of large numbers and difficult compares. So, one in terms of cash, I think you’re coming up on the decision related to the final Lasergen payment. Is that something we should embed in the 2018 forecast? And then, just any updates on development of a clinical NGS workflow? So, what I’ll do is provide you some comments around the guidance, inclusion or exclusion and then maybe Didier, you can just provide a few voiceover on how things are going with Lasergen. So, as a reminder, we have the ability to make a call option -- calling option in 2018. Just like any other M&A possibility, it’s not included in our guides at this point in time. So, Jacob, if you comment on how things are going? Yes. I would say, we have a very good relationship with Lasergen, and I I’m very pleased to see the Lasergen team and our Agilent come together. And as you might recall, we are not only get to develop an instrument but full workflow. So, what’s very important is that the teams work together, both for the instrument, but also for the full solution. So, the whole workflow works together. And I see that -- that we have very good momentum here and things are moving forward according to our expectations. And then maybe one more for Jacob, while we’re on it, the margin expansion in DGG. Obviously, another great year there. Just help us, what do you think the long-term opportunity is here, how far do you think you can push margins over time? I’d say that I am very proud of the team of what we delivered over the three years, of 700 basis points improvements with the CAGR of 8% over last three years growth. That is a very impressive turnaround of a business. We will continue to look at expansions. But, I can tell you that we don’t want to go with the same rate we have done over the last few years. We think -- we are out there with industry, with the average of industry and obviously we’ll continue to improve. But we will also make sure that we invest into the business going forward. Yes. Good afternoon, Paul. Right on schedule. So, just as a reminder, the plan has been to complete the construction in our 2018 and then move into validation process, which is probably 9 to 12 months, we think Jacob. But then, we’re looking at maybe second half 2019 back half is when we start to see some revenue coming out of that facility. And just as a reminder, the first, a full year capacity would add approximately $100 million of revenue to the Company. It’s really quite an impressive new facility we’re building, I had a chance to visit. And the construction is moving on quite well and we’re now into the final phases. So, we have a much better view of -- and confidence if you will in terms of the timeline. So, it’s a very unique facility, but we’re getting pretty close to the end. So, we have a high degree of confidence on the timeline. And then, also, you’d mentioned on the diagnostic side, your FISH panel won award. Now, are you getting traction in your FISH panel for PD-L1 due to automation accuracy? But I know automation had been issue in the past years, I guess that’s solve or what’s the color around that? Yes. What I’d like to -- let me make some additional comments and Jacob, please jump in here. But as Jacob pointed out, he used the word attraction of the Omnis platform and I think that’s where historically the former Dako organization had some gaps in its offering, relative to automation. We came out with the new platform almost like a three years ago and really it’s been well accepted in the market. You’ve seen us talk about from big wins like the Quest win here in the U.S. And I think that’s been on the -- part of this been on the strength of the new automation platform. Anything else, you’d add there, Jacob? I will say that all our IHC and PD-L1 is automated on one platform or the other. And we obviously have the strategy of having PD-L1 automated on both of our platforms going forward. The same on FISH, the Omnis platform was built primarily IHC but also for the FISH assays. And it’s actually automated on -- the FISH is automated on Omnis today. So, you can actually do that already today. Okay. And then, Mike, just to refresh, on pharma you were talking 6% growth this year, but a little lower in your guidance. Is that what you had mentioned? Yes, absolutely, Paul. So, what we had said was a slight moderation I think in the 4% to 5% for next year. No. The main reason there is a slight downward movement in terms of the outlook is really just based on the small molecule side of that segment that we’ve always felt that that’s what will continue, but not at the high double digit rate. So, this is more a question of really tough compares. The overall fundamentals are really solid. The comments around Europe really had to do with the timing of why we believe that we’ll have the kind of numbers we talked about in pharma next year, because there could be some questions raised, right, which is minus 5% Q4, 2017, there; is there something fundamentally a concern there. And we’ve gone out of our way in this call and really tried indicate no. And in fact, the order backlog is quite solid in the number of product categories which we’ve not yet seen revenues for, and that we’ve been thinking this is exactly how the market would develop. So, this is not at all surprise to us. Hi, Mike, thanks for that. Just a quick question on the GST. Was there impact from that in the quarter from India? Yes. There was a little bit of an impact. And I think as everyone who -- each of our competitors who is operating in India has also identified a slowdown due to the fact that customers and companies are just linked to the new agreement. And we think over the next few months, it will build -- the business will return to normal. It did have some impact on the pharma reported numbers, because we’re heavily weighted towards pharma in India. But we didn’t want to give you a whole -- of all kinds of details. But that did have some impact on our Q4 pharma results, although the business is coming. Okay, thanks for that. And if I could ask a bit of a strategy question on the LSAG business. I mean, traditionally, the LCMS instruments competed more on the sense of the end resolution, and now you have successfully kept those with Ultivo and brought about a smaller size and potential greater ease of use here. Could you maybe elaborate how that’s translating to it? I know this is early, so the instruments are starting getting out. Are those the same customers that are appreciating the same product or are you getting new customers into the mix? Thanks. Actually very good question. When we launched the Ultivo, we really launched it with a perspective that we want to dominate what we call the routine applications out there. And we are going first for food and environmental spaces, given the mass range the product has. It is a product that is really tailored towards ease of use and meeting the sensitivity needs that you mentioned as well for the targeted applications. I think this product will display a lot of strength in other areas as well. So, we will extend the range around Ultivo going forward. But when you talk about the overall strategy for LCMS, we are not entirely focused just on the routine markets. As you know, we have launched a bio[ph] solution very successfully which drives a lot of growth in the biopharma market as well. So, with both playing in triple quad as well as top [ph] space where we think there we have plenty of opportunity to still gain market share. And to Mike’s comment on strong R&D pipeline, LCMS is clearly one of the big bets we have in the Company, very heavily investing in R&D. Two questions for you. First, just following up on the Ultivo. It just started shipping this month. I was wondering if you could comment on what your capacity looks like for that system. And I guess with that, what kind of contribution can new products contribute in 2018? And then, I have a follow up. Yes. So, I think relative to the question about capacity is from a manufacturing standpoint, no issue at all. So, we’ve -- in fact, we are right now our launch plan with our manufacture lease have incurred at schedule. And you may have noticed in my call, we actually have begun shipping the product. And I think we don’t call out specifically, the revenue impact on new products. But, I would say this is just part of our formula. So, over the last three years, we have been out going to market, and we just put up our biggest growth rate in the history of the new Agilent, although I think I officially retired this, I had to stop using that new Agilent. But I think that’s part of our formula of success and I think that’s why I used the word momentum a few times in my script because we really feel like both in terms of the products that we’ve released over the 12 to 18 months plus the products we know that come out in ‘18 will continue to have momentum because each of our three business groups have a pretty robust set of R&D development activities and commercialization plans for next year as well. Sure, thank you. I just was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment within the CrossLab of lab service business. One of your competitors made a comment a week or two ago regarding some wins and just if there’s any changes going on in the competitive environment for lab service outsourcing? Well, thanks, Steve. And as far as the business is concerned we continue to see very robust demand for our services. And as you look at the deals, they come and go; there is nothing particularly material that we have in play that would actually change our trajectory for growth. So, for us, we continue to see, not only opportunity for the services in pharma but we are seeing stretch now into the broader aspect of commercial laboratories. And as Mike had said, we continue to bring to market robust set of capabilities into next year. So, from a broader market perspective around services, lab wide, demand is still there and we expect good demand going forward? Yes. Steve, I’m glad you asked that question, because as you know the creation of the Agilent CrossLab Group was on the major initiatives that came out with three years ago. And I can remember the time when we got off to a really good start, is it sustainable. And I think you’ve seen Mark and the team have been able to deliver high single digit growth for quarter in, quarter out. I think it really speaks to the power of the value prop to the customers. Sorry to harp on this, but in terms of revenue order push out on the pharma side. Is that what’s driving? I know you’re talking about recognize it early in fiscal 2018. Is that what’s driving the 1Q growth higher than rest of the year, calling for 5.25 in 1Q, the rest of the year close to 3.5. So, just wondering, does that make up that delta -- is it adding as much as 1% or 2%? Patrick, thanks for the questions. I’m glad you noticed that our Q1 revenue guide is higher than our full year guide at this point in time. And clearly, the pharma order to revenue conversion is part of the story. But I think just a greater story here, which is momentum in all three of the businesses. And that’s why we wanted to reflect it in our Q1 guides. Listen, we don’t know right now how the second half of the year will play out. But, we’ve got a good feel for the first -- next quarter too. And that’s why you’ve seen us guide higher than our full year core growth guide. So, Didier, I think this is departure from last year where when we actually guided lower in Q1 2017. So, pharma is part of that, but is not the exclusive part. I mean, this European mass spec story is part of that, but not the exclusive story for strength of our Q1 guide. And then, on China, high-single-digit a bit on the low-end of the recent range and it’s been more of double-digit grower for you guys. Anything to call out in the environment there or is it just purely a comp story? Thanks for this question as well. So, you may recall, last year, Q4 2017, we had 27% growth in China and 27% growth in what is our second largest market. We had been calling for a 10% growth for the full year, for China. And that’s exactly where we landed. So, we’re super pleased again with how the China business has developed over the year, right according to plan. Key contributor to growth and 10% growth this year for the full year off a very difficult compare, we are really quite pleased with result. So going into 2018, we’re expecting us to be in that – continue to be in that high-single-digit growth rate for China. So, continue to be an important contributor to the Company’s growth. Now that the transformation is complete, there is no more new Agilent, you’ve hit your targets, how should investors think about the operating model, going forward in a normalized year? Is the 2018 guidance the right way to think about it, a mid single digit core revenue growth rate and high single digit EPS growth rate? I think -- first, I’d say, the transformation is probably never done. What we’ve done is we hit some milestones for the Company, because we put out some three-year goals for the company. I think what I’d ask you to think about is, we believe that we will continue to grow earnings above revenue. We believe that we will continue to outgrow the market and our operating margin expansion track will continue. We’ve been very deliberate in terms of how we’ve improved our operating margins. And I think as Jacob kind of hit on this as well, which is we haven’t done anything that will compromise our ability to grow long-term. And I think that’s served us well. So, we’ve been taking cost out and improving our operations over the last several years. And we’ve been doing it in such a manner that has allowed us to really continue to sustain our growth. And then, I think the foundation of this company is set for continued outperformance. So, I would just say that way I ask you think about the Company is a company that can generate earnings growth faster than revenue growth and that whatever market environment that we encounter, we’ll be able to outgrow the competition. And we have this whole constant improvement we call our Agile Agilent program inside the Company, which is a mindset of continued process improvement. So, we think we are going to continue to be able streamline the Company and improve operating margin. We haven’t however put out as you know three-year long-term goals beyond the fact that we’re going to do better each year. And then, my follow-up, I’m trying to understand what some of the levers are in the second half revenue guidance of low single digit core. And specifically, how sensitive is that in your minds or even in your customers’ mind to the price of oil? Does that assume that oil goes back down to 45? And if it stays at 55, you would do better than those numbers or anything you can speak to on that front? No, I think, if you look at comments, we’re all kind of looking -- try to say that’s probably not the biggest driver, I would look at PMI. And I think, PMI is a better indicator of the overall growth in our chemical and energy business. Clearly, price of oil has some impact, but PMI is a major driver; there is a very high correlation. So if the trends will continue, then we’re probably in good shape in the second half, but we’ll have to see. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Thank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of all of the Agilent management team, thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us. In today\\'s call, I want to cover our Q1 business results and talk about Agilent\\'s business momentum. Let\\'s start with the business results. I\\'m happy to report that the Agilent team delivered an outstanding start to 2018. We exceeded our own growth and earnings expectations. We continue to outgrow the market. Q1 revenues of $1.21 billion grew 10% on a core basis, and we continue to improve our operating margins. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% is up 130 basis points from Q1 of last year. I\\'m proud to report that this is our 12th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins. The combination of strong revenue growth and continued margin improvements drove an adjusted EPS of $0.66 for the quarter, well above our expectations. Adjusted EPS is up 25% over the first quarter of last year. Now on to Agilent\\'s business momentum. When I use the term momentum, I\\'m describing strong, broad-based growth for all our businesses as we outgrow the market. In this context, our momentum remains very strong. First, our chemical and energy revenue grew 13% with broad strength in all product categories. Customers are investing across the spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in this market segment. After a long period of deferred investment, we are now seeing increased capital expenditures. Pharma is our largest business and had a strong showing of 8% growth. Growth is very solid across instruments, services and consumables in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives. Academia and government sustained its recent trajectory with 11% growth. Growth was driven by strength in China and Europe. Food revenue grew 8% against a difficult compare of 11% in Q1 2017. Europe growth led our strong results with broad-based strength across instruments, services and consumables. Diagnostic and clinical revenue grew 5% as expected, led by strong demand for companion diagnostics and pathology products. Environmental forensics grew 14%. Our forensic business was particularly robust driven by U.S. government purchases. Environmental growth remained healthy with solid demand for GC, GC/MS and ICP/MS. Geographically, China led the gains with strong high teens growth. Europe and the Americas delivered healthy high single-digit growth. Looking at the highlights from our business groups, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 11%, fueled by double-digit growth in major platforms led by mass spectrometry and cell analysis, demand in Europe and China and broad strength across end markets. On the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Luxcel Biosciences. Luxcel has developed a portfolio of cell-based assay kits that allow researchers to evaluate cell metabolism and function on standard fluorescent plate readers. This technology is highly complementary to our Seahorse Bioscience offerings and further enhances our position in the fast-growing cell analysis space. Our internal focus on innovation continues to receive external recognition. The Ultivo Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system was recognized as one of the top 2017 innovations by The Analytical Scientist. And, (sic) Instrument Business Outlook recognized Agilent as the Company of the Year in the Life Sciences tools market for our innovation across the company. Agilent\\'s CrossLab Group continued the strong performance with 9% core revenue growth. The Agilent CrossLab strategy, launched three years ago, continues to yield exceptional results. Our services business is focused on supporting customers to deliver greater lab efficiencies. As a result, services growth was strong across all regions and markets. We continue to introduce new capabilities for our customers. For example, we launched Agilent Care which extends and expands solution support beyond the traditional first 90 days of solution ownership. We also expanded the CrossLab Service Guarantee to our multi-vendor service business. If an Agilent instrument under contract cannot be repaired, it\\'ll be replaced with the Agilent equivalent. This improves confidence in Agilent as a customer focused service provider for multivendor instruments. This guarantee differentiates Agilent from our competitors and in the eyes of our customers. Fueled by our innovation investment, our consumables business was strong across both chemistries and supplies. Recently introduced new products and biopharma applications are making a difference in our reported growth. Agilent\\'s Captiva Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid technology is one example. The Analytical Scientist also recognized it as a top 2017 innovation. Our digital investments are delivering new capability to our customers. We have deployed groundbreaking e-commerce initiatives such as e-renewal of support contracts, making it easier for customers to do business with Agilent. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Demand continued to be healthy for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We shipped our first comparative genomic hybridization assay for diagnostic use in the U.S., GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay this quarter. We also made available to customers CRISPR activation and interference libraries. Targeted at the research community, these libraries use state-of-the-art validated gene targets that enable easy and a flexible implementation of targeted functional assays for the entire genome. Now, looking ahead, a few comments on our updated outlook for the rest of the year. We continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look at the business and stand ready to raise our full-year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. As such, we are now raising our full-year growth and earnings guidance with our strong Q1 in the books. Didier will share the specifics of the updated guidance, inclusive of the forecasted impact from the new U.S. tax law. While future market conditions are often difficult to predict, I can confidently predict that Agilent will outgrow the market in any encountered market conditions. A few closing comments before I hand off the call to Didier. First, I\\'m very pleased with our start to 2018. Following our stellar year in 2017, the Agilent team continued to deliver a differentiated customer experience, a great product portfolio and excellent operating results. The transformational strategies initiated we launched three years ago continue to work. We are maintaining our momentum. We are delivering on our measures of success to outgrow the market, improve operating margins and deploy capital in a balanced manner. Our One Agilent culture is built on a foundation of core values that puts the customer at the center of everything we do. Agilent\\'s collaborative work environment enables the leveraging of the full power of our team. As a result, our team provides a superior customer experience while focused on operational excellence, a combination that allows us to produce results. We continue our commitment to our Agile Agilent program. This transformational initiative continues to streamline the company\\'s operations and drive efficiencies. Our portfolio transformation and innovation engine continues to provide our customers with truly differentiated technology and solutions. Our innovation efforts are complemented by a focused M&A strategy. Our portfolio of offerings is second to none and will continue to strengthen. As evidenced in our track record of impressive results, Agilent has started 2018 with strength. The results speak for themselves. It\\'s what gives me the confidence to tell our team the best is yet to come. Thank you for being on the call. And I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand over the call to Didier. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q1 performance, well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered a core revenue growth of 9.7% versus a core revenue growth of 4.8% in Q1 of last year, and our adjusted operating margin at 22.5% was up 130 basis points versus Q1 of last year. Our EPS at $0.66 was $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 25% on a year-over-year basis. Currency had a favorable impact on revenues of $32 million and $6 million versus last year in guidance respectively and an impact on operating profit of $8 million and $0 million versus last year and guidance respectively. Our operating cash flow of $215 million was 85% higher than in Q1 of last year. And finally, we bought back $47 million worth of shares and paid $48 million in dividends. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2018. We are significantly raising the core revenue growth guidance of 4% to 4.5%. The new core revenue growth guidance is 5.25% to 5.75%. Also, the weakening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a positive impact of $108 million on full year reported revenue. The total impact of the increase in core revenue guidance and of the currency tailwind is an increase in midpoint revenue guidance of $165 million. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2018 revenues of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion. Turning to EPS. We are also significantly increasing our November guidance of $2.50 to $2.56. The new guidance is $2.62 to $2.68 with $0.04 of the $0.12 increase due to currency. We\\'re also raising our operating cash flow guidance from $970 million to $1.050 billion. There\\'s no change to our expectation to buy back 2.7 million shares and to maintain our diluted share count at 326 million shares. Lastly, I\\'ll provide some insights on the impact of the U.S. tax reform. Because our fiscal year started before the enactment of the new law, we will enjoy the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018. However, the negative effects, mostly the so-called guilty tax of the tax reform will not impact us until fiscal year 2019. However, because these benefits, net benefit of 2 to 3 points would only be temporary, we have decided not to reflect it in our fiscal year 2018 pro forma tax rate and now therefore maintaining the rate at 18%, as we expect this will be our tax rate in fiscal year 2019 and onwards. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We\\'re expecting Q2 revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion. The midpoint corresponds to core revenue growth of 4.25% on a difficult compare as Q2 of last year saw core revenue growth of 8.7%. Comparing guidance to the just finished Q1, Q1 fiscal year 2018\\'s 9.7% core revenue growth benefited from an easier compare, in part due to the date of the 2017 Lunar New Year and a $20 million to $25 million carryover from Q4 2017 when we saw extended order to revenue conversions related to higher European and mass spec demand. Conversely, Q2 fiscal year 2018 projected 4.25% reflects the expected impact of the 2018 Lunar New Year in addition to a tough compare. As for EPS, we expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.61 to $0.63, a 7% year-over-year increase at midpoint. Thank you. So, Mike, as you sort of look at the pacing, particularly in chemical and energy, and maybe some of the cyclically sensitive markets and how things have kind of played out so far and the momentum maybe you saw in January, I guess how are you thinking about the duration of some of this upswing? And how do you tease out kind of what\\'s underlying cyclical and what maybe is, you either via product cycle or share or renewed focus kind of growing just above market? Yeah. So, thanks, Ross. Great question. I can see you\\'re still on your game after being away for a bit. So, let me start with the latter part of your question, which is I think what you\\'ve got going on here is a really nice situation in terms of both improving market conditions at the same point in time where we\\'ve been introducing some pretty compelling new offerings, whether being gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and then spectroscopy portfolio as well, and ACG. All these products are playing into an improved market environment for our chemical and energy. So, I don\\'t think we\\'re just keeping pace with the market in terms of our performance in the chemical and energy with these double-digit growth rates we\\'ve seen. I think we\\'re also obviously picking up some share as well. But it is a nice situation to be in in terms of both strength of portfolio and improved market conditions. Ross, I\\'ve kind of given up the idea of any kind of long-term view of these markets having been burned in the past on that. So, what we\\'ve been saying is, the positive momentum is there. I have a hard time, sometimes, with that word. But for next quarter or two, we have pretty good line of sight in that business. We would expect to maintain the momentum we have been seeing in the chemical and energy space. And I think what\\'s been different over the last quarter is, we\\'re seeing the growth across all three segments now that are investing in CapEx both on the expiration now in addition to what have been growth in the chemical side as well as refining. So, again, I think the outlook we kind of thought about relative to our guidance is in the next quarter or so. And we\\'ll kind of keep an eye on it as we go forward. And maybe just on the balance sheet, obviously, with the tax reform formalized, you now have quite a bit of access to some of that trapped cash historically. So, how should we think about your willingness to maybe do something slightly larger on the deal size? I mean, you\\'ve obviously executed fantastically well. You\\'ve kind of earned the right to maybe do something bigger or what you want. So, I guess, one, how should we think about that improved access to cash and your priorities there? And then secondarily, do you think the business can sort of take on maybe a larger and then very small tuck-in or technology deal, which is what you\\'ve done maybe over the last 12, 24 months? Yeah, happy to answer that question, Ross. I\\'ll leave the timing of when we think we may be able to get access to the overseas cash. I think we\\'re still working through that right now. But what I can share with you fairly confidently is both are thinking about these, the cash and then I\\'ll get into your question specifically relative to M&A. So, when we think about, as you probably gather from Didier\\'s remarks that the tax reform is a positive for Agilent in terms of the access to overseas cash both on, if you will, the one-time repatriation of the cash that has been trapped, but also just an ongoing cash flow advantage back to Agilent in the U.S., but we\\'re in no rush here. We\\'re going to be disciplined with how we use the cash. The priority will remain M&A and capital expenditures, which is really to invest in the business. And as you\\'ve heard me talk before, we remain committed to this balanced capital allocation policy. Now, specific to the questions around M&A, I do really appreciate your feedback. I actually believe that we have built up the capability and have now a track record of delivering on the yields we have done. So, I appreciate that feedback. And our primary focus has been on bolt-ons as you know, where the prices for the deal for Agilent have been in the several million to several hundred million dollar range. But right now, as I had mentioned before, we\\'re open to larger acquisitions but they still have to align with our long-term strategic intent, gaining more growth and earnings expansion for the company. And so, while we don\\'t have a predetermined number, we\\'re going to continue to be disciplined and selective. But I do believe the company is in a position that it could consider something larger than we have done in the past, both in terms of based on the operational results we\\'ve delivered as a company, but with inside the company we have really grown these muscles and really know how to make these things work with inside the company. Hey, thanks. Mike, I want to dig into the pharma numbers here. Nice recovery. Obviously, there was a fair amount of noise coming out of last quarter around some of the deferred revenues in Europe and the replacement cycle, and the NASD lumpiness. So, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the pickup in pharma, how much of that you think is just catch-up from last quarter versus sustainable acceleration here? Yeah. So, thanks, Tycho. And as you may recall from our last earnings announcement, there\\'s one area of concern I\\'d picked up in the call was, hey, is there something going on with Agilent\\'s pharma business? And at that point in time, we described the situation where we had a very strong incoming order rate, but there many of them were longer lead-time products from an order to a revenue standpoint. And that\\'s exactly what happened. We guided for growth in pharma. I think there was a lot of questions about whether or not that actually would occur after coming off a 5% decline in Q4 2017. And the quarter developed exactly as we had thought. So, what I would tell you is that we have roughly $20 million to $25 million of revenue that was basically in backlog in Q4 that we shipped them, most of it, in this first quarter. So, I think we\\'re right on our view of the overall growth for pharma for us, which is in the mid single-digit. So, I wouldn\\'t want to imply that there\\'s an acceleration of growth, but I think we continue to be very confident in our ability to make the numbers we committed to. And we saw both strength in biopharma and the small molecule side of pharma for us. So, we really were pleased with the numbers we put up in the first quarter in pharma. Okay. And then on DGG, I know you had a tough comp there. It did decelerate a little bit sequentially. Anything to call out there? Still up year-over-year, but just wondering if there\\'s anything from an end-market perspective you can call out for DGG. Yes. So, yeah, you\\'re right, Tycho, that we had another strong quarter on the top line growth with 8% growth. And we\\'re very pleased with that. We saw very strong growth from our pathology and our companion diagnostics business from a margin perspective. We have five divisions, and the mix continues from (23:49) quarter-to-quarter. So, the long-term view is still intact and we were actually expecting to be in this level. So, there\\'s nothing from the market perspective that impacted our performance. Okay. And if I could just ask one last one on Lasergen, that\\'s coming up in terms of you guys making a decision. Anything you can tell us at this point or do we have to wait couple of weeks here? Yeah. So, what I would share with the audience – thanks for the question, Tycho. We continue to be very pleased with the progress that Lasergen is making on the program. And as you may know that we have a pre-negotiated deal structure, which would allow us to exercise a call option in March. And I think that\\'s probably all I\\'m going to say at this point in time beyond the fact that the time of the exercise does fall in the period covered by our 10-Q. And if there would be an exercise, you would note that it\\'d be in the 10-Q. And just as a reminder, we\\'re thinking about Lasergen along the lines of any other acquisition. So, it\\'s not been considered in how we guided for the rest of the year. But, again, we continue to be quite pleased with how the program has been progressing. So, you have a great cadence of new products coming to market. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense for how much that was contributing to growth in the quarter and within that, maybe an update on the Ultivo cycle and how things are going. So, I\\'ll take the first part of that and then I know Patrick would just love to talk about what\\'s going on with Ultivo. That\\'s really a tough question for us to answer, and I\\'m not trying to dodge the question. We don\\'t really have a quantitation along those lines. I would just say it\\'s part of the story. We know that – if you\\'ve been noticing the growth rates of Agilent over the last three-plus years, the growth rates are accelerating. And what\\'s been going on at the same point in time is our cadence of new product introductions has also been accelerating, because in the earlier phases of what we were calling then the new Agilent, we\\'re basically redoing a lot of our product roadmaps. And now, we\\'ve got them redone and we\\'re actually executing and delivering. So, I\\'d say it\\'s a major contributor, but I really can\\'t provide a level of quantitation on that. Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. So, on the Ultivo product, and to what Mike said, all these new products drive a lot of good momentum for us in our end markets. And if you take Ultivo, for example, which we started shipping last quarter, and I\\'m happy to report that it\\'s well ahead of our own plan in terms of ramped volumes, and we\\'re really pleased with the acceptance that we own in our own field by the customers. We get excellent feedback from the first installations out there, and it\\'s driving a lot of excitement about our product portfolio. So, it\\'s not only driving the Ultivo volume itself, it\\'s also driving a lot of collateral business for us in the LC/MS business. And I think this pipeline of new products that we have launched over the last two years is a major contribution for us, in our trajectory right now, we\\'re taking market share. And, Patrick, if I remember our conversation from this morning, it\\'s both in our expectations relative to unit growth as well as price per unit. So... Great. And then in chemical and energy, I was wondering if you could just give us an update in terms of what\\'s built in the guidance for 2018. Obviously, the macro picture continues to be robust. In 2Q, is there anything Lunar New Year-wise that we need to consider there? Just, thanks, any feedback would be great. Yeah. Let me make a few comments here. So, there is somewhat of a Lunar New Year. And I told Didier earlier, so I\\'d hope at one point in time one quarter I won\\'t have to talk. Every year, we seem to talk about Lunar New Year, but this is a reminder for the audience. What happened here is the way the Lunar New Year fell this year, many customers actually wanted shipments of products before they left for the holiday. So, we had some revenues that we thought were going to be in the second quarter that actually showed up in China in the first quarter. On the chemical energy, I wouldn\\'t say that\\'s material at the company level, however, but there\\'s a portion of the business that\\'s impacted. We think about the overall guide for the year, I think we\\'re probably – if you think about our guide, the midpoint of 5.5%, I think you could probably put us 6%, 6-plus-percent, 6%, 6.5% for chemical and energy. And, again, we\\'re expecting a continuation of the momentum, albeit we\\'re starting to go into a period of tough compares, because, as I mentioned in my call, it\\'s now been four quarters in a row of double-digit growth. And now I have to compare my growth against those hot numbers. But, again, the market environment continues to be positive in chemical and energy, and we\\'re kind of in the 6-ish range for the year. Hey, guys. Two questions for you. First, Mike, just was wondering if you could comment at all about the kind of pricing and promotional environment of late in some of your analytical instruments. Are you seeing any changes as it relates to pricing either from some raw material inflation or just from a competitive standpoint? And then I guess secondly, it kind of goes along with that. You made the comment that you feel like you\\'re outgrowing the overall market. Just was wondering, is there any particular areas of notable strength that you feel like you\\'re really outgrowing the market as it relates to the different product categories you\\'re in? Yeah, sure. Happy to address both questions. So, there\\'s been a lot of talk about the inflation, inflationary concerns. And it\\'s put a drag on the market, as you know, at the time of release, introduced a level of volatility in the market we haven\\'t seen for a while, but we\\'re not seeing that in our market. So, of course, the markets are very competitive. There\\'re certain competitors who tend to focus more on price than we do. But, Patrick, I think it\\'s pretty fair to say that we\\'re really not seeing a lot of real changes in discounting practices or pricing structures in the marketplace. And that\\'s why I\\'d actually asked – I pointed out earlier, for example, in our new product category that we just introduced, we\\'re actually doing better on the ASP side than we had actually anticipated. So, we\\'re feeling pretty comfortable about where the price points are. And, yes, yes, sorry. Yeah. So, in terms of market share, we look at the macro numbers and said okay, we know our growth rate\\'s higher than our peers, and then we kind of peer into the different product categories. I think we have a good handle, particularly on our LSAG instrument side because we\\'re able to compare ourselves through and externally, if you will, an independent source of data, ALDA. And we can see where our market shares are really picking up. And I think it kind of spilled out a bit in my narrative, but mass spec was strong double-digit growth; chromatography, spectroscopy, these are places where really we can say confidently we\\'re picking up share relative to the competition. But at the same point in time, even though we don\\'t have the same stats, we know in DGG, on the pathology side we continue to pick up share growing there. So, it\\'s been a sort of a broad-based story, but in particular we can talk with a lot of confidence because we have external data around our instruments. Thanks for taking my question. So, first one is maybe for Patrick or Mike. Just trying to understand what was the really strong in mass spec area in LSAG? So, what sort of products that are driving the growth here and what end markets? And if Patrick could give those details. And if you could also help me understand how much of that was revenue recognition from the last quarter and how much of that was the contribution into this quarter. And then I\\'ve a follow up. Yeah, I\\'ll kick it off. So, when you look at the LC/MS space, we definitely have seen the strongest growth in the Quadrupole space, meaning single-quarter and triple-quarter. And a lot of that was driven by the product launches we made last year at ASMS. We introduced the Ultivo, we also introduced a new single-quad product, both drive healthy growth for us in LC/MS. And in terms of growth that drove in revenues in Q1, yes, some of it was driven by the strong order growth we had in Q4 last year, but we see a continued momentum behind these products. So, I\\'m not concerned on the outlook of these products. The funnel looks pretty healthy. When you look at the end-market space, as Mike mentioned that pharma is doing very well for us in the LC/MS, but we also see it in Applied Markets like in food analysis where this product is heavily used. Okay. That\\'s very helpful. Thanks. And then a second question that I have is, we saw a large set of promotions that were running on both instruments and consumables in the LC business. The consumables are no surprise to me, but instrument discounts were intriguing at the end of first quarter where it seemed like the benefit looks to land in fiscal second quarter. Hoping to see if you can elaborate something on that. And essentially if there are drivers, what were the drivers of those promotions? And if there was any benefit in 1Q from that and how should we think about the second quarter fiscal in light of those promotions? Yeah, Puneet. Thanks for that insightful question. And this is a general statement. We tend to run promotions on a regular basis. And this is part of our mix when we\\'re trying to target certain areas or certain geographies or certain market segments. And then, we have gone down a path of promoting, if you will, the entire solution and not just picking an element of a particular purchase that a customer would be interested in. So, I think it may be a specific question about, maybe you can comment specifically, Patrick, about what\\'s going on in the liquid chromatography area between you and Mark on the column side. Yes. Yeah, I think what we\\'re really doing here is, we are leveraging the strength of both instrument and the aftermarket business in the consumables. When we launched last year the Infinity brand LC consumables as well, we thought it\\'s also now a product that really put some stronger campaigns behind it, again, as Mike said, this is nothing unusual. We do this really to extend our market region, we try to reach customers which potentially have not considered Agilent in the past, like at the lower end of the portfolio is what you have seen there. So, it\\'s not a strong discounting account across the entire portfolio. We\\'re really trying to target also entry-level systems and customers who want to benefit from the Agilent performance and quality of our instruments and aftermarket solutions that have not considered us today. And this was part of that promotion you probably referred to. Yeah, I mean, the strategy here is really to get new incremental growth, new customers, not sell to existing customers at a lower price point. I want to save Valentine\\'s Day for other people, but regarding where you are in the stage of your operating margin expansion, can you detail some of the efforts ahead and are you in inning one or two or three of that margin expansion program? And then secondly, regarding I know CrossLab has been part of your strategy to take share. What\\'s your visibility? Is this the multiyear share gain still ahead for you? Yeah, what I\\'m going to do is, I\\'ll take – by the way, thanks for the comments, Paul. I\\'m going to go ahead and take the first question. And Mark, if you could pick up the second question on ACG\\'s longer term outlook. So, in terms of the margin expansion, we were really just delighted to see the 130 basis points of improvement in Q1. And as you may recall, we had a bogey we had put out last year to hit 22%. And I told us, listen, that\\'s just a milestone along a longer journey of continued margin improvement. So, fundamentally, we think that we can continue to improve operating margins about a 35% incremental moving forward. And then to your question, we have some real specific programs lined up. So, I mentioned in my remarks about our Agile Agilent program and we\\'re still finding ways to simplify the company, streamline the company. A lot of the focus now is in our back office operations as well as how we handle the incoming orders from customers. We have still a very manual process. And we think that we can really automate that, and we have what we call a touchless transaction initiative inside the company. And, again, I think it leads to more seamless customer experience and increases our velocity of transactions we handle. And we don\\'t have to continue to add people at the same rate as revenue. So that\\'s one area of focus for example. The second area, and I think is actually much more significant in terms of P&L impact is the initiatives that we have underway in our order fulfillment organization. So, the evolution of that was phase one was really about moving products into lower cost geographies . And now phase two is really heavily focused on three aspects, which is, one, is focusing on the material costs for the company which last time I looked was well over $900 million of purchases. We\\'re in the midst of a major transformation of our procurement organization and how we engage and work with suppliers. And it\\'s already starting to translate into some lower costs, while maintaining – or in some cases, even improving quality. We have a major initiative of value engineering, where we basically use our engineering prowess to reengineer certain components for lower cost while sustaining improvement of performance of the product. And the last area is logistics where we continue to find ways to lower cost. And you may have caught a recent announcement, if you follow the local news in Tennessee where we have made a major move to insource logistics from FedEx in Tennessee. So that will also be one more example of things we\\'re doing in the supply chain to lower cost. And then the third thing I would just say is, in general, across the entire company we have this continuous process improvement mindset where we continue to find ways to streamline what we do to make it more efficient and make people\\'s work inside the company more enjoyable while also having the great benefit of doing a better job for our customers, and obviously the P&L. So, I think those things are sustainable. I think we\\'re still in middle innings, if you will, on this. We haven\\'t run out of ideas and we think we continue to sustain this performance. Mark, in terms of sustaining performance, perhaps you can share with Paul and the audience your thoughts about the long-term growth prospects for ACG. Thanks, Mike, and thanks Paul for the question. Obviously, we\\'re very pleased with our ongoing very consistent high single-digit growth performance. And we\\'re confident in our ability to grow. And it\\'s not just from a market share gain perspective, it\\'s also bigger account penetration into our current accounts and also portfolio expansion. And Mike alluded to this at the beginning of the call, what\\'s fundamentally been a growth driver for us. And we saw accelerating growth throughout the remainder of 2017 and now into 2018 has been our consumables portfolio. This started well over a couple years back. And there\\'s never going to be a single big product area inside our consumables business that that\\'ll drive top line, but over the course of FY 2017 we added over 1,000 new products into our portfolio. And as you probably can guess, those then get pushed through our channels, our expanded e-channel reach and then ultimately they have long-term annuity streams that in many cases last over a decade. So, I\\'d say across the board, if we look at it from our enterprise business, our instruments service business and our consumables business, we continue to see great opportunity to continue to grow across those dimensions that I just mentioned. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. You can be mine. There you go. So, I\\'m just curious about sort of like the pacing. I mean, obviously you gave guidance in mid-November, and then I think we all were sort of feeling a little bit conservative on – I think we all assume are being a little bit conservative, but I think the quarter\\'s results were a little bit above and beyond certainly what even the most bullish people were thinking. So, what was sort of happening in the pacing in December/January? Was it bigger budget flush than normal, just better order trends? I mean, was there any sort of inflection that you saw in terms of the outlook? Yeah. Great question, Derik. And I think what we saw was, overall, if you look at the strength which really surprised us was, we saw stronger than forecast growth in academia and government. We weren\\'t expecting that kind of number, 11%. Chemical engineering we knew was going to be good, but we didn\\'t think it was going to be that good. And in Europe, we knew it would be good, but not that good. So, I think things just came in stronger than we forecast. The year-end budgets were there. So, we had a lot of order strength coming into the calendar year. And we were able to turn a lot of that into revenue in the first quarter. The one that we hadn\\'t anticipated in addition to those points I just made relative to the market environment was, customer behavior in China, which is, what we had was a timing issue or we had some Q2 revenue pull in from the Lunar New Year because typically customers want their products, says, ah, Lunar New Year, we\\'ll deal with this after we come back. But for some reason, this year, which I can\\'t really explain, they were looking for products to be taken earlier. So, we actually had more revenue in China. I mean, we had upper teens growth in China for the quarter. We think China\\'s still going to be a source of growth, high single digits, maybe 10-ish for the year, but it won\\'t grow upper teens like it did in Q1. So, I think of all the things that one I think we hadn\\'t anticipated from a standpoint of different customer behavior in China, although we didn\\'t think the budget would be as strong as well in certain market segments. So, it was a quarter where everything came together very, very nicely. And we\\'re happy with the numbers. Okay. So then China pull forward, and then maybe a little bit from the Easter holiday, although and for the timing of that that\\'s sort of the basis for the 4.25% core guide for the next quarter? Yeah. And Didier, I forget as to how much we had estimated might have been pulled in from the China? So, yeah, about $10 million we have pulled in and then we\\'ll have another $10 million feed because of the Chinese New Year in Q2. Okay. Thank you. That\\'s very helpful. Just one other follow-up question. This is actually another China question. I noticed on your slide deck you launched this Value line of consumables for China. And just can you talk a little bit more about that? Maybe I just missed it. I wasn\\'t familiar with that as something going on and sort of talk about that and is that something that\\'s applicable more globally? Yeah, I think I\\'ll have Mark make some comments here. So, this is relatively your closed study of the company, because it\\'s relatively new introduction for the company. So, Mark, why don\\'t you share with Derik your thoughts about what\\'s going on in China and whether or not this model may play out in other geographies. Hi, Derik, Mark. As far as China is concerned, we\\'ve gone on record that we wanted to look specifically at China\\'s marketplace, look at a portfolio that\\'s fine-tuned to China. And our Value line offering in China was to address customers who are still looking for higher quality, but not quite as much capability in our supplies in chemistries business. And we\\'re obviously very pleased with the initial results of this and extending that portfolio. At this juncture, we certainly see the opportunity to move this to other areas where we could see the same value proposition, whether it be parts of Southeast Asia or India. We\\'re not ready quite to pull the trigger on that, but our primary focus is China, just because of the enormous market opportunity there. But that was the intent with this Value line is, same quality they expect from Agilent that at a performance that\\'s relative to the tests they\\'re trying to accomplish there. And, Derik, I would just add. We don\\'t see this as cannibalizing our current business, we actually see it as an addition. I think there was some concern, oh, we\\'ve introduced new product, are we going to cannibalize our own business? This is type of segment we\\'re not able to address right now. So, we\\'re pretty excited about this. Mike, just go ahead and reiterate that comment, it really has been a bolt-on to our current business in China. Great, thanks. Maybe one for you Mike. On Intuvo, has your view changed at all on that adoption curve trending, probably the sharpest acceleration hitting maybe three years into the launch? And then, now that we\\'re 18 months into the launch, are you seeing more customers come back with multisystem orders? Yeah, absolutely. So, speaking for Patrick, I\\'ll jump right on this one, which was, we are starting to see repeat orders and multiunit purchases of Intuvo GC, particularly in high throughput applications where they\\'re also using mass spec. So, it\\'s playing out just as we thought it would. But I will tell you it takes the customer some time to understand exactly what it is we\\'ve delivered to the marketplace. I can just share with you firsthand, last week I was in India and I sat in on a seminar with some of our key VIP customers who are very knowledgeable in gas chromatography and they had a lot of questions and there had been some hesitation because it was so new, but once they had opportunity to really understand it and see it, really see how unique the innovation here is. And, in fact, one of the customers said, listen, gas chromatography has been sort of the same way for decades, this is really quite something different and you really have changed the thinking about innovation. It really is easy to use. So, customers who have it have been really pleased, and we\\'re now starting to see repeat buys and multi buys, so, that ramp rate is starting to occur. Okay. And then how should we be thinking about potential larger scale pharma M&As impacting? I mean, I assume there would be a pause in the instrument purchases, but could that actually be an opportunity on ACG to accelerate growth just with the operations in productivity side? That\\'s exactly the answer. You\\'ve got it. So, we\\'ve been through these kind of cycles before, but we\\'re actually – if, in fact, they would occur, but the company is in such a different position than it was during some of the other bigger consolidations we\\'ve seen in the past. So, yeah, you would have a pause on new instrument purchases. At the same point in time, it\\'ll create new opportunities for us in the ACG business as it relates to both enterprise services, relocation, also refurbished business units. We\\'ll probably get very actively involved in taking some of the excess equipment that customers may have and taking it back into Agilent and redeploy in other set market segments. So, we\\'re not overly concerned about this. And we\\'ve also found historically when there\\'s been merger and acquisition where they tend to want to consolidate or put more spends on to a fewer vendors, it plays to our strength, really reliable equipment that has high performance and really has a cost of ownership advantage to them. So, I think the ACG story is one thing that really allows us to say, if this would occur, it\\'ll be mitigated by some of the change we\\'ve made in terms of the company\\'s portfolio and capabilities we offer to the marketplace. Mike, a question about the government and academic segment. I mean, two straight quarters of double-digit growth. Could you give us a sense of how that looks geographically and what areas you think you\\'re gaining share and if it\\'s something you changed commercially that might be contributing to that? Yeah. So, the funding environment has been improved in Europe and has remained strong in China. So, geographically, we\\'re pointing to Europe and China as the source of strength for academia and government. But your intuition was spot-on, which is we\\'ve really fundamentally changed the commercial approach to this marketplace. And that\\'s why it is always hard to predict market share gains when you\\'re doing your guide and your forecasts. But I think that\\'s one of the reasons why we\\'re seeing such strong growth because what we\\'ve done is we fundamentally have – we reorganized our academia and government channel. And I think that would be in quotes because a couple years ago, it was a very fragmented approach to these university and government market. Now we have one focus channel backed up by a company-wide academia program supported by a number of initiatives such as our Thought Leader Awards and other access programs we had with our Agilent Labs. So, this combination of a new go to customer model in academia and government backed up by some new company level programs I think is starting to yield dividends. Super. And then one more. In terms of the Nucleic Acid Solutions facility expansion, just want to check and see if there\\'s many change in the timeline. And when do you plan to start the validation process? And how long does that take? Great question. It\\'s actually very timely, as we just had a review on that just a few hours ago. So, Jacob, if you can remember the details perhaps you can handle that question. Yeah, absolutely. And we are pleased to report that we continued to move forward according to our expectations meaning that our validation efforts will start in early next year and then continue. We actually believe it will take quite a while. This is a unique setup we have. So, validation will take a while to get through. It\\'s not something that happens within a few months, but over a period of time. And we do believe that would be all done by end of next fiscal year. And then start to see revenue into 2020, sometime in 2020. Hopefully a little bit in 2019 too. But we\\'re really feeling happy about where we are. We just had a very detailed review of the production progress. We\\'re pretty much almost done the construction side of the production. Capabilities are bringing on and then we\\'ll start moving into, as Jacob mentioned, validation. Really strong Q1 in bumping up guidance pretty significantly for the full year, despite comps getting a bit tougher as you talked about. Can you confirm that your overall guidance philosophy hasn\\'t changed? I guess, what I\\'m getting at is, if end markets continue to hold up as expected, do you still feel there\\'s plenty of room for you to do better than your revised guidance as has been the case for the past couple Q1s? Yeah. Thanks for the recap of the guide. And you\\'re exactly right. There\\'s been no change in our thinking about how we guide the company. And I tried to call that out in my script, and I think I used the word we\\'ll continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look. And we stand ready to raise our full-year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. And that\\'s what we\\'d said for example the Q4 of 2017. And that\\'s exactly what we\\'ve done here in this first quarter. Excellent. And then maybe one on cell analysis. You\\'ve called out cell analysis as a key growth driver over at least the past few quarters. How much annual revenue do you have in this area now including the recent Luxcel acquisition? And is this business still growing 15% to 20%, which I think is what you called out around the acquisition of Seahorse? Yeah. We don\\'t report directly the specific numbers around the vision of the company. But I think you can probably gauge the relative size if you can go back and look at what we said at the time of the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. And it is growing in the ranges you just described. Looking at the final market, we\\'ve heard about massive job cuts at Teva. What\\'s your opinion on the overall help of generics market? And what\\'s your revenue exposure to these customers, and Teva, specifically? And then could you break out what you saw in recurring pharma revenue versus instrument? Yeah, sure. Happy to address a number of points that you\\'ve asked about. So, first of all, I can just share with you, I think Teva is a company-specific challenge, not an indication of what\\'s happening in the macro market environment. And I mentioned earlier that I\\'d been in India, and, of course, the generic industry is quite important in the Indian marketplace. And I was with a number of executives from generic pharma companies, and they\\'re really excited about where things are going. I think there\\'s something like $50 billion worth of new drugs coming off of patents in the next two years, on the small molecule side. They\\'re making a lot of investments in biosimilar. So, that marketplace is very healthy. And I think Teva is going through some of its own internal challenges, but I wouldn\\'t say that\\'s indicative of the overall marketplace. They are a customer of ours, but I think it\\'s not material at the company level in terms of the business volume there. And then I believe the instrument aftermarket ratios are fairly dissimilar in pharma as they are in the rest of the company, maybe – yeah, yeah, which is probably in the range of 55% or so aftermarket, 45% upfront. Hope that helps. Hey, Mike. I think you guys got the high points here, so, maybe just one for me on the segment margins. LSAG was up pretty nicely in the quarter. Do you think you\\'ll continue to stay at that 100 bps to 200 bps range, just given what seems like there\\'s some good leverage potential there. And then, I guess on the flipside, where do we think about DGG margins going, just given the step down for the quarter? Yeah. So, I\\'ll make some initial comments and then invite Patrick and Jacob into the discussion. So, I just saw exceptional performance in LSAG with 11% growth. That really shows you when we get to top line, we get a lot of leverage in the margins there. And as we mentioned earlier, we think the pricing is holding up. So, we\\'re pretty confident about the margin going forward. I don\\'t think we can expect that level of improvement every quarter, would be my guess, Patrick. You\\'ll not see the same level of improvement for sure. But, again, to your point, is what we definitely see is that the new products have better gross margins. They are very competitive in pricing, which is, again, driving a lot of it. And when the volume picks up, as we have seen the last quarter, then you get these exceptional results. Right. I think it also shows our business model side of the company. Hey, when volume picks up, we don\\'t go on a spending spree here. And that\\'s how we can get the margin expansion. And I think it\\'s important, maybe as we shift over to DGG, is, there\\'s a lot of puts and takes each quarter in DGG given just the nature of the business. And so, again, we\\'ve had a great run in terms of margin expansion and we think we\\'re going to be in a solid position as we begin exit 2018. But perhaps maybe just a little bit more insight in terms of how you think about where you are on the margins, Jacob. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And as mentioned before, we came in low. We always do that in Q1 since we have a strong run rate business and very dependent on the number of days in the quarter. But at the same time, we have a relatively high fixed cost space. This is the impact you will have in Q1. And we have that basically every year. And then there is, on top of that, some mix that can move from one quarter to the other. And that is really what you have seen in this quarter, but overall came in as expected. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to happen the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Thank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of the management team here in Agilent, we\\'d like to thank you all for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. Thanks, again.

Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website. Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\\'s call. Before I discuss the Q2 financial highlights with you, I\\'d like to first welcome Jacob Thaysen and Sam Raha to the first earnings call in their new roles. Most of you know Jacob from his former role as the President of Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. He now is transitioned into a new role as the President of our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. Sam is replacing Jacob as the new President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group. Sam, as you may recall, rejoined Agilent a year ago as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Both Jacob and Sam have extensive backgrounds in life sciences, wide industry knowledge and connections. Both are highly experienced at building and leading large organizations. Agilent is fortunate to have a deep leadership bench to draw upon to fill these two roles. Now let me turn to our Q2 financial performance. I can report that the Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Our momentum continues. Our core revenue growth of 4.3% is at the midpoint of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.65 exceeded our expectations and is above the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS is up 12% from a year ago. We delivered adjusted operating margin of 21.9%. On a currency adjusted basis, this is our 13th quarter in a row of improving operating margins. After two strong quarters to start the year, our core growth now stands at 7% with adjusted operating margin of 22.2% and adjusted EPS of 19%. I\\'m making some references to our first half results as Lunar New Year had a material impact on the timing of our reported revenues. In Q1, our Chinese customers requested deliveries earlier than anticipated. As a reminder, this pulled in approximately $10 million of revenue from Q2 into our first quarter. In Q2, we also estimate that the reduced number of selling days due to Lunar New Year had a negative impact of close to $10 million on our ACG annuity business. These two factors reduced Q2\\'s reported company growth by 2 percentage points. Back to our Q2 results and turning to our end markets. Pharma, our largest business, continued a strong showing with 8% growth. Strength in mass spectrometry, consumables, services and genomics led the results. Growth was strong in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives. Our chemical and energy market revenues grew 5%, in line with our expectations and against a difficult compare of 14% growth last year. The global chemical and energy market environment remains favorable although we noted a slight pause among our U.S. customer base, which may be attributable to some concerns about trade policies. We grew 2% in academia and government, driven primarily by strength in LC/MS, cell analysis and our CrossLab services and consumables business. Diagnostics and clinical grew 3%, led by strength on our reagent partnership and genomics business and offset continued weakness in the U.S. pain management market. Food revenue was down 1%, reflecting initial impact of the Chinese government reorganization of the food safety ministries. On March 21, the Chinese government announced the creation of the National Market Supervision Administration, NMSA, consolidating many previously independent agencies, such as AQSIQ, SFDA and SAIC into one market supervisory agency. This has resulted in a temporary slowing of new instrument purchases as ministries are being consolidated and decision makers are being clarified. We expect the reorganization will take as long as 1 year to be completely finished, with expected slowdown of six to nine months in new instrument purchases. Environmental and forensics grew 2%, driven by strong gains in our global forensics business. In March, the Chinese government also announced some changes to the structure of the environmental ministries. These changes, however, are not as large as those for the food market ministries. While we did see some slowdown in new instrument purchases, we expect business to return to higher levels of growth in the next quarter or 2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe grew strongly with high single-digit growth. China was flat in Q2 due to the timing impact of Lunar New Year and the recently announced changes to the government food and environmental ministry agencies. For the half, our China team delivered a strong 9% core growth. Now I\\'ll cover some of the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 3%. Growth in chemical and energy remained robust, offset in the weakness in the food testing market. From a product perspective, we saw strength in LC/MS, cell analysis and ICP-MS. Our new LC/MS, Ultivo, continues to be well received by the market and performed ahead of our targets. On the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. Agilent is known as an innovator in capillary-electrophoresis-based instrumentation, and this acquisition will add complementary technologies to our portfolio. The regulatory review is underway. After the quarter end, we also now plan to acquire Genohm, which closed today. Genohm is a developer of highly differentiated, on-premise and cloud-based software solution for laboratory management. The Genohm team would join Agilent as part of our LSAG group. Customers are looking to do more with their data. By integrating Genohm\\'s platform into our OpenLAB portfolio, Agilent and its OpenLAB value proposition encompass the management of all the context and content in the lab. We continue to build out our cell analysis business. In collaboration with BioTek Instruments, we announced a new integrated solution that combines cellular metabolic balances and imaging technologies. This collaboration provides new capabilities to our Agilent Seahorse analyzers, which help biologists measure cell activity in real time. Agilent CrossLab Group continued its consistent, outstanding performance with 7% core revenue growth, gains across our major end markets led by double-digit growth in pharma and academia and government. Performance was balanced across consumables and services. China delivered double-digit growth, and all other geographies grew in mid- to high single digits. During the quarter, we made progress on our mission to prove both the science and the economics of our customers\\' laboratories. We introduced an innovative and extremely stable new GC column that is receiving a very positive response from customers. ACG service has expanded to Agilent-enabled services pilot to include additional platforms across Agilent. The pilot is aimed at improving the customer onboarding experience by shortening their time to value after they purchase our solutions. We also opened a new Global Solution Development Center in Singapore to meet the increasing demand for integrated end-to-end solutions. Our online capabilities continue to gain momentum. Our China online business has seen double-digit growth since the beginning of the year. And our China WeChat services program has attracted more than 13,000 active customers since its roll-out at the end of last year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered core revenue growth of 4%, as expected, led by strength in our genomics business. On the innovation front, we introduced several new products this quarter. Our launch of HRP Magenta for the Dako Omnis, Agilent\\'s flagship instrument for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, allows pathologists to more easily visualize cancer in skin and lung tissues. We continue to expand our portfolio of in situ hybridization probes with the release of 7 new probes for Omnis to maximize our differentiation in automated ISH staining. On the genomics side, we announced -- we enhanced our industry-leading target enrichment portfolio for next-gen sequencing. Our recent introduction of the SureSelect All Exon V7 is being well received by customers as it improves both performance and cost effectiveness. On the genomics informatics front, we released a new module for the Alissa Clinical Informatics Platform. This new module further simplifies informatics processes and accelerate timed results for our customers. We continue to invest for future growth. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining shares of Lasergen and close the acquisition on May 7. As many of you may recall, we made an initial investment in Lasergen in 2016 for a 48% ownership stake. This acquisition brings into Agilent a powerful sequencing chemistry and a world-class group of scientists and engineers dedicated to bringing our integrated clinical workflow solution for molecular diagnostics to the market. We are very excited to have the Lasergen scientists and engineers on the One Agilent team. We expect to invest about $35 million per year to deliver our molecular clinical workflow solution to the market in 2020. Now let me provide a few remarks on where we are in our journey at Agilent and our outlook for the rest of the year. The Agilent team continues to execute, and our momentum remains. We are right where we want to be for the first six months of the year. We delivered strong growth while improving operating margins and deploying our capital on a balanced manner. Once again, our EPS growth is in the double digits. Our R&D innovation engine continues to strengthen our portfolio. We\\'re all excited of the new capabilities through M&A. We believe this combination of organic growth-driven investments and complementary M&A, together with our execution capabilities, will deliver continued strong growth relative to the market. For the past three years, our focus has been on building the company\\'s foundation, a foundation that will leverage the One Agilent company culture, innovation and execution capabilities to generate above-market growth and earnings expansion. Our platform for top line and earnings growth is now in place. We are delivering. When we\\'re rebuilding the company, I also want to focus on making the company more agile and responsive to our market environment. Looking forward, we continue to proactively assess market forces and moving the agile manager to capture most promising opportunities. As you know, our two largest end markets are pharma and chemical and energy. Through the first half this year, our pharma performance has been above our expectations and we are raising our full year pharma outlook. Our full year guide for the chemical and energy market business remains unchanged. We expect a strong mid to high single digit growth. Geographically, we are bringing down our expected full year growth rates in China to about 7% as a result of the expected pause in businesses from the realignment -- realignments of the government agencies. At the same time, we remain confident in the strength of our European and Americas business and have raised our full year outlook for these geographies from the Q1 guide assumptions. While there are some end market and geographic give-and-take, our overall model remains intact. Following the significantly raised guidance last quarter, we are reaffirming our full year core growth guidance and earnings guidance, inclusive of currency headwinds and increase in our molecular clinical workflow offering. The Agilent team is confident, energized and excited about our future, our next phase of growth and delivery of results. We are looking forward to sharing more about what is behind this outlook in our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day. Thanks for being on the call and we look forward to answering your questions and seeing you in June. I will now hand off the call to Didier, who will share more insights on our Q2 financials and updated outlook. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered another strong performance this quarter and year-to-date. For the quarter, our core revenue growth of 4.3% was in line with our guidance, and we over delivered on operating margin and earnings per share. Our core revenue growth would have been more than 1 percentage point higher if not for ICP-MS shipment delays and the recently announced reorganization of Chinese government ministries. Our adjusted operating margin of 21.9% was 40 basis points above the implied guidance, and EPS of $0.65 was $0.03 above. Further adjusting for currency, the operating margin was 22.4%, i.e. 30 basis points above last year and as highlighted by Mike, represented our 13th quarter of increased year-over-year operating margin. We delivered $303 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we bought back 674,000 shares of Agilent stock for a total of $46 million and paid $48 million in dividends. I\\'ll now cover the guidance of fiscal year 2018. We are maintaining our core revenue growth guidance of 5.5% even as we anticipate that the reorganization of Chinese government ministries may push out about $20 million of revenues into fiscal year \\'19. We are also maintaining our EPS guidance of $2.65 while absorbing $22 million or $0.06 for FX and our technology investments in Lasergen and Genohm. Regarding Lasergen, we forecast to spend $15 million this second half and about $35 million in both fiscal year \\'19 and fiscal year \\'20 when we plan to commercialize our solution. There is no change to our operating cash flow guidance of $1.05 billion and CapEx guidance of $200 million. I\\'ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.185 billion to $1.205 billion and EPS of $0.61 to $0.63. At midpoint, revenue will grow 4.3% on a core basis. Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. The operating margin guide, it\\'s - for the year, it\\'s down about 20 bps. Is that FX and the diluted impact of the acquisitions, is that what\\'s going on there? Got it. And I think you already answered my question about what you\\'re going absorb in terms of Lasergen. But what are these other deals, the ATT, the - I\\'m sorry, the Advanced Analytical and the Genohm, going to add in terms of the top line for M&A contribution? Do they have significant revenues? Yes. Because it hasn\\'t closed, we have not included it at all in our guidance projections. We will only do that once it closes. Got it. And so I\\'m a little bit curious on the China comments. It\\'s -- none of the -- just having -- you guys are at the end of earnings season and none of your elder life sciences peers sort of commented, and it sounds like this happened late in March about the Chinese food reorg. I\\'m just sort of wondering, can you talk a little bit more about that and exactly what\\'s going on and why you think it\\'s going to take a year to sort of wind through the system? Yes, sure. As you may know, they have these two big annual sessions they call -- I won\\'t read out the full abbreviation, but the NPC, the National People\\'s Congress, and the CPPCC, which they had these two annual events. And after those events occurred, on March 21, they announced the reorganization of the ministries. And where we came of the estimate of about a year was based on our experience in 2014 and \\'15 when there was a similar reorganization within the CFDA and we saw a pause of six to nine months of business during that period of time. And we\\'re using that as a similar rule of thumb. It\\'s very consistent with the estimates on our teams. So - and I can remember we, on the earnings call at that time, are saying, listen, the businesses are not going away, but we know that there will be a pause at least on new instrument purchases as they work through all the changes. So that\\'s our - that\\'s a guideline. Of course, legacy will be shorter, but we wanted to be somewhat cautious on our outlook given our prior experience with the major, major changes such as this. The change on the environmental side is much less significant and should have a shorter-term impact. Hey, thanks. Maybe I\\'ll start with academic. You had a similar comp this quarter and the last quarter, obviously the results a little bit later. Is that just the timing dynamic? Or is there something else going on? Yes, Tycho, you hit it right on the head. It\\'s just the timing. That business can be a little bit more lumpy, but we\\'re actually positive on the overall funding of academia and government. So I wouldn\\'t over-read into that quarterly result. And of course, we also had the shortened period of business in China, which also affected that a bit as well in academia and government. And then chemical and energy, you called out the slight pause in the U.S. Can you maybe just talk about that dynamic and if trends have proved at all in May? Yes, thanks, Tycho. I mean, the numbers were solid. I mean, we had 5% growth off of a really difficult compare, but there\\'s some kind of noise in the system particularly in the U.S. Business is good, but it could have even been more robust. And I think there\\'s this -- as you know, business doesn\\'t like uncertainty. And there\\'s lots of uncertainty, what\\'s going to happen in terms of trade policies and tariffs. And so I just -- we thought it\\'s prudent to mention that it didn\\'t affect materially the results, but the noise is out there although we, as you can see in our guide, we still remain very confident of our ability to grow this year in chemical and energy. And I know we\\'re going to talk a bit about China today as well, but that\\'s one segment of the China market that is really, really strong. And we can expect goodwill there for years to come. But again, we just thought it was good to share with the audience what we\\'ve been hearing from some of our customers. And is it fair to say you\\'re not yet seeing meaningful benefits from Intuvo at this point in chemical and energy? Yes, it\\'s ramping, as we said. It\\'s part of the story there, but we still have a lot more runway with that product. Okay. And then last one on Lasergen. Are there milestones we should be thinking about on the development pathway here in terms of placing additional beta units? Or how do we think about the road map here for commercialization? Look, for some of the visibility [ph] in the market in 2020, I\\'ll wait later on for that, Sam, right? Okay. Thank you. So just a quick follow-up on Lasergen there. Mike, is the $35 million in annual spend, is that all incremental or is some of that in the base? And then how does that impact how you\\'re thinking about the margin expansion trajectory for corporate Agilent in fiscal 2019 and 2020? Because that\\'s a material amount of spend versus what we would think of as a normal operating margin improvement cadence for the total company. Yes. We\\'ll give you some more detailed information in the analyst meeting in June. But I think it has been that our core business will continue to follow the incremental growth in terms of margin expansion you\\'ve seen over the prior years. So this is a dilutive acquisition for us, but we think we can carry this forward. And we\\'ll share all the details with you when we meet in June but -- and again, our core model of continuing to expand the operating margins with incrementals is intact. And then finally, just trying to think about how to size the China food safety exposure. Is it fair to think about your business in China being a mid-single digit grower until this normalizes? Or is it lower than that over the next, call it, six to nine month time frame? We\\'ve provided the outlook. The guidance is for 7%. We used to have 10% in the previous quarter guidance. So we are now at 7%. Good afternoon, guys. I just want to be clear on sort of the sequential headwinds, Q1 to Q2, and then sort of the jump-off from there because I think you said a couple of different things. So we had, obviously, the New Year shift. We had the day shift in the quarter, and then it seems like there was also something you said on ICP-MS. So just help us. Versus the original plan, what were the actual components of the delta that affected this Q? And it seems like the only thing coming out of this Q that\\'s updated new, other than maybe the developed markets are better, is sort of China net worse because of food. I just want to make sure I get the cadence and the components right. Yes, let me take that one, Ross. It\\'s -- you are absolutely correct. The Lunar New Year was -- impact was obviously already reflected in our guidance as well as the very tough compare. Remember that last year, we had 9% core revenue growth; and the year before, 8%; and also the fact that last year, we had $7 million of settlement with our -- within our DGG organization. What is new versus the previous guidance are the shipment delays on ICP-MS and the reorganization of the Chinese government ministries. So only those 2 factors, which take away about 1 percentage point of our growth, we have not included in our previous guidance. Got it. And in terms of risk factors both positive or negative to the 2H guide, I mean, where do you think there\\'s the biggest potential either for up or down side from a segment perspective or end markets? Sure, I\\'ll take that one. So I think the chemical and energy market continues to offer the biggest upside for the business. So we\\'ve already raised the outlook in pharma, and maybe we could do that again. But I think both the big end markets for the -- for Agilent are very solid with potential upside in chemical and energy. And that\\'s why I mentioned the -- some of the noise. So as soon as we can get some clarity on trade policy, I think that will -- really will calm things down. And if that happens fairly soon, I think it would be really good news for us in this space. So I think the chemical and energy market offers the biggest upside for us. And then although we\\'re trying to take a very objective outlook on China, maybe the -- it\\'s always hard to predict how quickly these things happen. We painted what we think as sort of, if you will, a longer tail scenario, but we could actually find a move through the process much more quickly. So I think that might be an area where you could see some upside relative to our guide assumptions. Yes. And just maybe, Mike, sorry, on that. The ICP-MS comment, is that decoupled from the China food comment in that... Well, no, it\\'s actually part of the China story. So it\\'s actually about -- what, about $10 million, I think, or so? About $10 million. So we... $7 million, $8 million, close to $10 million. So I would like to round up a bit, as you can tell. But that was just a byproduct of the product is hot right now. So we\\'re -- we just had a really, really high backlog. And as you may know -- I think you know this already, Ross. Particularly in China, you have to get an IVL license to get the products through the approval [Technical Difficulty] government. So that took a little bit longer. And I think, Didier, we\\'ve already shipped those this quarter. So it would have been nice -- I mean, for this, recall it would been nice we got them in last quarter but I think it is... Yes, it\\'s in the bag for the quarter. It\\'s already been shipped and booked. But again, it was this more of a backlog issue because we\\'ve been seeing such strong growth particularly in China for ICP-MS. Hi, good afternoon and thanks for the time here. My first question is actually on margins. I appreciate the commentary that you have a good degree of confidence that the underlying margin expansion trend is intact. But as I look at the last few quarters or the last three quarters at the incremental margins, they\\'ve been tracking below the 30% target level. I wonder if you might help us understand why the trend is evolving along those lines. Are there any operational items to call out? And when could we see - a return back to the 30% plus level? And yes, it\\'s interesting. The impact of mostly currency on both the top line and the gross margin is fairly significant. So you are absolutely right. When you look at our unadjusted operating margins, reported operating margins incremental in Q1 and Q2, they were, respectively, 32% and 20%. If you adjust for currency and a little bit -- but that\\'s very minor for acquisition. But on a core basis, you get to 36% for Q1 and 34% for Q2, so very much in line with our model. So it is mostly the impact of currency. And what happens there is that with the weakening of the dollar, it increases the numerator -- the denominator, sorry, which is the revenue. And it has negative impact because of the hedging policy on the numerator, which is the margin. So all in all, if you adjust for that, you get back to our model regarding core operating margin incremental. We have some data in our annex, I think, we\\'ve published. Or anyway, if you want, I can take you through the details, but that\\'s basically the impact. Okay. And then two quick ones for the DGG line. One is, I wonder if you could give us an update on the time lines for the capacity ramp in Colorado. And then, two, could you speak to the trends that you\\'re seeing on immunotherapy assays, PD-1, PD-L1 assays, given all the enthusiasm out there now for TMB testing as a diagnostic approach for IO? And I\\'ll get back in queue. Thanks. I\\'m glad we had a chance to be able to point to other members of the team for a couple of questions. I\\'m actually going to pass this over to Jacob in your old role. And what I would just say, to start things off, is we just completed recently a review of the factory build-out in February. And I think we have the latest information. So Jacob, if you wouldn\\'t mind taking those two questions. Yes, absolutely. So thanks for that. And again, a reminder that we see a very strong market in the NASD business, the nucleic acid solutions for API business. And so we\\'re very confident that we will have a -- continue to have strong growth. And as you also reminded ourselves about this, Steve, is that we are in a situation where we have more demand than we have capacity. So we are now building out and we\\'ve done that for a few quarters now but building, and it\\'s very impressive to see the site coming along out in Frederick out -- close to the Boulder site. And we\\'re still progressing according to our plan, and we\\'ll expect to have products coming out here in basically a year from now. The PD-L1. So PD-L1 on the IHC platform and the question is how is that going to compete against the tumor mutation burden and other genomic assays. And what we see and what we believe is this will be complementary. First of all, most IHC continues to have a growth trajectory. We had a very, very strong penetration over the last 18 months, and we continue to see the growth here. What we believe is that -- and what we can see in the market is that immuno-oncology is just much more complex than probably one marker is giving you information about. So what we believe is and what we can see out there, we can see our customers are using that, the ones that start with TMB, is that they are using both and they will continue to use both markers. So we don\\'t see a business cannibalization. We actually think there\\'s a lot of synergies between the markers. Great. Mike, I\\'m curious if you could give us a sense of how chemical and energy orders progressed through the quarter? And as we look at this business today, is it any less cyclical today, especially given the new product cycle than perhaps it was 3 to 5 years ago? Great question. So the first one, I think we saw nothing out of the ordinary in chemical and energy. The only thing I would contact, I mean, in terms -- I mean, comment on would be, again, chemical and energy grew in China but not as much as it normally would grow just given the shorter period of time. But chemical and energy looks fine to the whole quarter, nothing out of the ordinary. And I think there\\'s probably a case in May that it\\'s a little less cyclical just because of the fact that there\\'s a lot more pent-up in aged equipment than it was when we started the cycle three or five years ago. So I think it is the more -- a more cyclical business for us, but I think to some degree, I can\\'t handicap it. But directionally, I would say it is a little bit less cyclical than it has been in the past. And a couple for Didier. Number one, on the pharma outlook for the year, maybe I missed that, what the new outlook is for core growth from pharma. And then secondly, would you mind walking through the hedge and the translation impact? I see $6 million in the supplement -- in the back of the supplement packet, but curious if that includes both the hedge and the translation effect on OP. Yes. So in terms of pharma, Mike mentioned that we are raising our full year pharma outlook and we are raising it from 5% to 6%, so slightly raising it. And in terms of the impact of currency, you\\'re mentioning the $6 million and that\\'s the impact for the full year. Precise number is $5.4 million. And it\\'s a negative headwind that comes from mostly translation impact offset by some gains due to our hedging. So it\\'s the net of the two and continues to basically offset whatever direct impact you have from the translation. Maybe just starting with another question on China, just a cleanup question. You mentioned that you believe the days effect related to Lunar New Year resulted in a $10 million headwind. I think you said specifically within CrossLab\\'s. Did Lunar New Year have a broader impact on the quarter? And if it did -- I may have missed it, if you quantify that. No, no, no. We were just trying to show kind of like a normalized growth rate, what it looked like, for the quarter. And you\\'re exactly right, the $10 million, just because the customers weren\\'t in the office or in the lab for that day. Clearly, the business will come back. And I think that makes the CrossLab number that we report even more impressive because we delivered double-digit growth with that effect. So in a normal quarter, we\\'ve had a much higher reported growth. And Doug, if you don\\'t mind, while we\\'re on China, there\\'s -- I think there\\'s a report -- I know we\\'re going to spend -- there\\'s a lot of focus, rightfully so, in the call about what\\'s happened in the food segment and the market in China. I think it\\'s important though, the overall dynamics of the China market where we play, for example, pharma, academia and government, chemical and energy. I was just in China two weeks ago speaking firsthand to our customers at Sinopec. So those markets are still very robust, and we can expect a lot of growth from them in the coming years. So again, I think it\\'s also important to kind of think about the overall context of the China market. We know there\\'s been a lot of puts and takes this quarter with Lunar New Year and this reorganization of the ministries. So happy to answer any additional question you might have on China as well. Yes -- no, that\\'s really helpful, Mike. And I guess kind of what I was getting at is there\\'s that $10 million impact on CrossLab and what was, even with that, a really strong quarter for that part of the business. There\\'s presumably a broader days effect on the business, which may be harder to quantify but certainly have an impact on overall growth. Is that a fair statement? Lunar New Year -- the day’s effect of Lunar New Year, it\\'s easier to quantify within CrossLab, but presumably, it has some impact on the broader business, which you didn\\'t quantify. Yes, that\\'s a little bit tougher for us. So that\\'s why we were hesitant to put something out. We count the days... By instrument, they would have bought instrument in - with one week less in a quarter but - whereas for service consumables, we are really - those are lost days. Yes, okay. So then a broader guidance question. Your reaffirmed guidance assumes you maintained a 4% to 4.5% year-over-year growth rate for the remainder of the year. If we look at 1-year comparisons in the two year stacks, it seems like you\\'re assuming that growth moderates a bit relative to recent trend. In spite of actually sounding pretty good on most fronts, are you baking in a little more cushion than you have recently to account for unforeseen surprises just given all the incremental uncertainty in a couple of areas that you described in your prepared remarks? That\\'s probably somewhat of a fair assumption. I think that what Didier and I are trying to do is we try to guide in a way that will accommodate if we have a surprise or two. And look at what happened this quarter. We were able to beat our EPS guide and the consensus on the EPS side, but we hadn\\'t seen the ICP-MS shipment delays or the reorganization of the Chinese food ministries. So we\\'re able to accommodate those within the guide. So that\\'s our philosophy. And I think we\\'re hoping to be able to set up the second half so, if something else would happen to occur that we hadn\\'t seen coming, that there\\'s room in there for us to absorb it. Okay. That\\'s great. And maybe one last one. There were a lot of timing dynamics in the quarter. Oil prices may be working in your favor. Trade policy uncertainty may be causing things to take a little longer than maybe before. With all that in mind, any chance you\\'d provide some directional commentary on order trends, book-to-bill, anything like that? Beyond the fact that we can tell you that the pacing of the orders was nothing unusual beyond, I think, maybe discussing specific to chemical and energy, Doug, but I think your comment about some of the orders taking a little bit longer in the U.S. because, okay, let\\'s see where this thing -- where lands. So I think that\\'s -- I could comment on cycle time to order close in the U.S. No, no, no. And the earlier question was, \"Hey, Mike, where do you think your upside could be to your plan?\" I think it is chemical and energy. So... Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. A question maybe for Jacob, hi Mike, a question for Jacob in his new role, if he\\'s willing. A lot of discussion on the mass spec market... Okay, good. We\\'ll put him to the test then. In -- just in the mass spec market, you guys have been pretty active on the development side. I think you called that out as a strength this quarter. Can you just maybe talk about the growth that you\\'re seeing? If you separate out the high-end research side from the more routine, applied market products, how does growth compare there? So I know Jacob would love to jump in on this question, but I think he just had about a few weeks to get close to the business. So I know you\\'ve been digging in a bit but why don\\'t I take this one, which is -- the routine market is really where we\\'ve been focusing a lot of our new portfolio moves. The Ultivo LC/MS is doing very well relative to our targets, and that\\'s really -- it\\'s really focused in the places where you have the highest volume in the routine market. So that\\'s where we\\'ve been doing really quite well with the most recent introduction. That being said, some of the enhancements we made to our portfolio, particularly on the bio LC/MS side, have really enhanced our position on research side. So we\\'ve seen growth, strong growth in both segments of the mass spec market. But I think just given the volume in our businesses in the routine segment, that\\'s been the driver for the overall revenue for the -- for LSAG, but really quite pleased with both portfolio moves we made there. Jacob, anything you\\'d like to add to that? Yes, okay. Well, my second question is actually on DGG sort of a similar tack. I mean, you did specifically call out the way the demand was shaping up for tissue and staining products. Can you do the same on the genomics side? I mean, what are you seeing as far as the contribution from sample prep [and then arrays] especially given that there are some new products there as well? By the way, I\\'ll pass that to you, Jacob, as well. But just a reminder or 2, when we look -- I think called out in my script, but when we look at the growth rates of our DGG business relative to the Q2 last year, it\\'s probably about a 3-point effect given we had order cancellation that was booked all in -- around NASD business in Q2 and that -- on a normalized basis, DGG growth would have been 7% in Q2. So with that, Jacob, if you could just add some thoughts on the genomics side. Yes, absolutely. I\\'m certainly more comfortable in taking that question. But we\\'ve actually seen quite a good performance in genomics recently. I think you have seen the overall market perform very well, and we have certainly benefited from that. So we have seen very strong growth in our SureSelect business, especially with the XT HS that came out. I think it\\'s six or nine months ago. And we see very high demand, adoption of that. Now the V7, as Mike mentioned here, just came out some weeks ago. And the good news here is that it\\'s -- we have seen very good feedback from our customers, but we won\\'t -- we haven\\'t really seen it in our numbers yet. So I think actually, that\\'s a good opportunity in front of us with that product also. Okay. Maybe just one follow-up. Is growth on the Target Enrichment side kind of in line with NGS growth overall? Yes. Sam, I know you\\'ve been looking on that site. I\\'m dying to get you on the -- get your voice on the call as well. So why don\\'t you take that one? Yes, happy to take that. And absolutely, what we\\'re finding is good growth returning for our Target Enrichment portfolio consistent with what you\\'d expect in the NGS market if you look at the others that are participating there. We\\'re seeing that both with our larger accounts or national accounts and global accounts, if you will, as well as the broader marketplace, so very happy with the growth that we\\'ve seen. And based on what we are seeing directionally, we expect that to continue in the coming quarters. I wanted to follow up on Dan\\'s first question related to mass spec. Have you seen any changes in the competitive environment recently? Can you provide an update just on how the Ultivo is resonating in the market versus your plan? Yes, Jacob, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll take this one as well. So actually, the market has been fairly stable. We haven\\'t really seen any major moves of significance by any of the competitors. And then for us, this is such an important new offering for us because we\\'re not yet the leader in this space. So it\\'s not an installed base replacement marketplace. This is actually a market expansion play for us. And again, we\\'re playing to -- one of our strength is really to provide tools to the routine market where they want robust, reliable instrumentation that gets the job done. And that\\'s really what we\\'re -- we do quite well in addition to providing leading-edge technologies for the research side of the business. Great. Thanks, Mike. And you\\'ve -- on M&A, I just want to follow up on that. You\\'ve certainly been active in terms of a string of tuck-in deals now. Are there any additional pieces of the puzzle that you need to put together at the clinical NGS workflow? And can you talk about where the investment is going in terms of either content or informatics or the platform itself? Where are you investing there? Yes, some great questions. And again, some teasers for our June Analyst Day. We\\'ll spend a little bit more time going through our thinking around M&A. But as you know, we like M&A in markets where we know the customers, where we know that we have a channel and really can leverage the scale of Agilent. And that\\'s the kind of opportunities we\\'ve been pursuing. Relative to the NGS workflow, we\\'re continuing to build that out. We\\'ve brought in the sequencing chemistry, as we just mentioned. And then we\\'re in pretty good shape right now, but there\\'s always things we can do perhaps on the informatics and content side. And Sam, anything else you\\'d add to that? I think, Mike, you\\'re exactly right. Just to further detail out, we feel very good about the fact that we have a number of gold standard elements of the NGS workflow, be it ours or the NGS workflow that\\'s being used broadly. But there, definitely, is opportunity for partnership or adding content inorganically -- elements, sorry, such as content at some point. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. First, on Dako, can you give some commentary on how the Quest rule-out has gone and any opportunities for incremental wins in that space? So Jacob, you\\'d like to comment on the former Dako business, which we\\'ve been referring to as our pathology business. I know that amidst of the roll-out, that\\'s been a point of major dialogue in the company to move us into -- Dako into Agilent. So how are things going with Quest? Well, things are going very well. And it\\'s been a while since we announced that deal, but usually, these things take actually some time to implement fully. But we have a very good traction and more of -- half of the instruments has been installed in the sites. And we also start to see the -- a good uptake in the revenue. So we\\'re very pleased with where we are. We\\'re very pleased with the partnership with Quest. We have also seen that business resonated in the market and there are other types -- similar types of accounts that is interested to look into the opportunity. Right, great. And then can you just remind us what percent of your China revenue is food? Is it similar to the breakout of the total company or more heavily weighted in China? Catherine, if you don\\'t mind, hold on for a second. Didier is pulling out his calculator. My guess is -- I think it\\'s probably a little bit heavier weighted relative to the global average in Asia. Hey Mike, could you talk a little more in granularity about where you\\'re heading with this operating margin, like specific actions? I think your COGS program, you\\'ve been working on that, what, the last year or is it longer? What other initiatives do you -- are you working on? And then I guess layering on that, Didier, are you leveraging your manufacturing to stay at that 30% incremental operating margin as well? Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. And Didier and I are going to go through this in a fairly high-level detail when we see all of you, hopefully, in June. But conceptually, we\\'ll be doing -- this has been a multiyear phase program with different areas of prioritization and focus. And the message that we\\'re going to deliver in June and I\\'ll share right now is there is still more programs behind the numbers. So when we talk about the margin expansion, it\\'s not just a hope and a dream. There actually is something behind it. And the something behind it, to your question, Paul, would be really very heavy work in the -- or the fulfillment area, manufacturing, particularly focused on material costs, supply chain, value engineering will be big movers for us in terms of reducing our ongoing material costs. We also have initiatives around how we manage our pricing and discounting. If you -- we think we\\'ve got room there in terms of how we think about the pricing and discounting. And then we\\'re also making some major investments in our R&D systems that we think will allow us to come to market more quickly. And then from a cost standpoint, take a lot of costs out of our platform cost because we\\'re going to force the sharing of common components across all our divisions where historically, our divisions have operated fairly independently on an R&D side. Didier, anything else I missed there? And then last, Mike. On academia at plus 2%, where do you think it will shake out for the year? 2% seems kind of below market right now. Yes, for that quarter, I think that\\'s fair. I think when we look at our guide for the full year - where were we on that, Didier? I think we were at about 5%, right? About mid-single digits? 5%, 5-ish plus, so mid-singles. So - and we\\'re actually quite bullish on academia and government, Paul. The Agilent team -- and we\\'ve gotten sort of our active owner, if you will, a couple of years ago really refocusing on how we sell into academia. We have a company-wide academia program. And like I said earlier, the funding conditions we see are more favorable than they were a year ago. So we think this combination of improved Agilent capabilities and funding environment bode well for continued strength throughout the year. And again, I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the Q2 result. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess first, for Didier, I was noticing your expected interest expense for the year is now down, I think, maybe $12 million or so versus last quarter, just wondering if there are any initial comments on that. And then secondly just -- if there is any additional color on the Ultivo and the feedback you might be hearing from customers on why that\\'s being adopted so well so far now that\\'s been out there for 6 months. So I\\'ll take the first question, yes. You are absolutely correct, Steve. And part of that is the higher interest -- higher yields, higher interest income, more cash available. But I must say that part of it is also that our previous forecast was extremely conservative. And then relative to, Steve, your question on the Ultivo. So if you remember, the initial value proposition, which was the [power of the tiger], this high-performance instrument in a very small footprint and easy-to-use instrumentation, rugged. So -- and it\\'s stackable. So that value proposition, which we thought would resonate with customers but you\\'re never 100% sure until you actually get product out in the market. So -- and as you can imagine, very much like we\\'ve seen with the Intuvo, which is -- it\\'s so different that often, customers are saying this really works as advertised. And yes, it\\'s working as advertised. So I think what\\'s been happening here is the value proposition we thought around the new workflow for the customer, now we\\'ve been able to prove that it actually performs as intended. We\\'ve really been getting a nice uptake. And again, I think this goes to our ability to really understand what it is that customers want and really how to help them with their -- both their science but also the business operation side of their lab. Okay. Then if you don\\'t mind, if I could squeeze in one more follow-up. The Chinese ministry-related delays or, I guess, cutbacks, did that have any impact here in 2Q? Or is that -- the $20 million of push out is that just a second half phenomenon? No. We think about $5 million or so is what we estimated in Q2 and then the other $15 million in the second half. Okay. So you\\'ve got $5 million from that and then another $7 million to $10 million of ICP-MS delays as well in China? Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I had a question -- I was just trying to understand -- not sure if it was covered. In terms of weakness in pain management, my understanding was the reimbursement was already lowered here some time ago. Was there another downtrend? Or what\\'s driving this weakness here? And could you size that business for us? I think it\\'s this working out the excess capacity that was in that space. So we saw one of the customers went [indiscernible] customer went bankrupt in the space last quarter, and it\\'s primarily associated with our refurbished LC/MS business. It\\'s probably the biggest piece, right? A little bit of everything really. I mean, it\\'s really when you sort out the part that comes from DGG, that\\'s a positive and it\\'s offset by about two points related to everything else, so the refurbished business but even a little bit of service and consumables, a little bit of instruments, a little bit of everything, [indiscernible] has any significance. But altogether, it took away two points of growth in clinical and diagnostics. And we highlighted in the call just because there hasn\\'t been any new market development. I think what\\'s been going on, though, is just the capacity is coming out of the system. Got it. So two points on DGG was the impact, okay. And I just wanted to clarify just one last thing on China. I mean, last call, you highlighted a number of efforts targeted to enter into the entry level in China in terms of instrumentation, somewhat of a value line. So my assumption was those were targeted towards food given that these labs are more independent and food labs are somewhat cost-conscious to begin with. So after this regulation is set and done in six to nine months, what\\'s your expectation? Do you think that line would be more in demand? Or would you think more premium offerings on the market are likely to fare better here? So I just wanted to understand that and maybe just around overall impact to the rest of the peer group as well. Yes. Puneet, thanks for the great question. And I think what you may have been referring to was the value line of new consumables and chemistry products we introduced specifically for China. What I\\'m going to do is have Mark maybe make a few comments to that, and I\\'ll double back and provide you some commentary on instrumentation as well. Sure, and I\\'ll just voice what you had said, Mike. It\\'s a value line that we\\'d introduced well over a year ago in China, been very well accepted. That being said, it wasn\\'t necessarily targeted. The food market targets anybody in the general space across broad sets of markets. So we intend to obviously continue to build out that value line as time goes on and we\\'ll find market-specific offerings but that wasn\\'t -- the intent is to go specifically after food. It just turned out, as you know, 40% of the business is derived from there. But to your question about the -- thanks, Mark. The question around the composition of instrumentation, I think you still expect to be very heavily focused on mass spec, which is the tool of choice in food safety analysis and also food authorization. So whether it be GC/MS, ICP-MS, LC/MS, there is a growing market for routine instrumentation, still high-quality instrumentation but less features. And that\\'s what we\\'ve been doing with our -- primarily our chromatography portfolio on the GC and LC and molecular and spectroscopy [indiscernible] spectroscopy side to build out that for routine. But relative to food safety, we think there\\'s going to be a very heavy demand for mass spec. But again, it has to be -- what we\\'re seeing, as the business starts to migrate into the Tier 3, 2 -- Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, you really need to make sure you have an instrument that\\'s robust and easy to use, which has been our design back there. By the way, I think we -- I should have commented earlier, too, which was the dynamics of the food market are changing in China as well as who buys. So we\\'ve been focusing a lot on the government agencies, but we\\'re also starting to see more and more testing push to third-party contract testing labs, where the Chinese government say, listen, we\\'re not going to pay for everything ourselves and fund and build all the labs. So that also could be -- I talked earlier about the give and takes in the market and potential upside, which is dependent on how quickly these -- the volume shift from some of the centralized labs into the contract testing labs. That could bode well for us because we\\'re a really strong player in these areas. Again, we want to see how things shape -- shake out here over the next few months before we actually call that\\'s what\\'s happening. But I think it\\'s important to understand that dynamic as well because even though we\\'ve been through a major ministry reorganization like this a couple of years ago, the trend towards more testing done in third-party private labs is new. Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Mike. Just on the capital deployment front. Can you talk through an update on the larger-sized deal pipeline? How large are you comfortable going with the improved balance sheet post repatriation? And then would you do a larger scale earnings diluted deal? Or should we think of that as not on the table? You mean earnings? If I think -- I\\'m going to go to the second question. If I understood correctly, if we were to do an acquisition larger than we\\'ve done so far, we would do an accretive deal. So we would not be doing large technology -- or acquisitions of companies that weren\\'t profitable or marginally profitable. So my model works and I can bring in like a technology acquisition, and we\\'ll go through some of the details with you in a few weeks. But the model works. I could bring in a technology acquisition on Lasergen, but don\\'t assume that\\'s sort of our norm. We actually -- we prefer to do bolt-on that have revenues and profit. And the -- we\\'re going to -- we\\'re open to larger bolt-ons. I would just leave it at this. We want to make sure that we want to -- we\\'re still, I think, quite disciplined with our -- with the use of our cash, and we use the standard financial metrics on how we look at returns. But I think the biggest thing -- the biggest takeaway I\\'d like to share with you is that we really want to do deals that are in the areas that we know. So don\\'t look for us to do what I would consider transformational deals where we\\'re often in a space where we don\\'t know the customer base, we don\\'t know the markets and we don\\'t -- really don\\'t know the business as well as we should. So we want to stay in a place in the markets where we know quite well. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then I know exploration is only 10% of the chemical and energy segment. But given the move higher in oil, can you just talk to how sensitive that business is to higher oil prices and if you\\'re baking any improvement related to improved conditions there? Usually, it\\'s a -- great question. Usually, it\\'s fairly sensitive to movements in prices, and we\\'ve seen in the past where we\\'re completely shut off. I\\'d say that that\\'s why -- that\\'s sort of behind my earlier question. You may have teased it out of my response, which was -- you would have expected this exploration piece to pop even faster in the U.S. than it has been. It\\'s not down like it was before but -- and that\\'s why we\\'re saying, okay, there\\'s some noise for some of our customers. Matter of fact, I was just reading an article today in a journal about some of the -- some of our customers in the -- in this area, they\\'re trying to figure out what is all this hire. I get my stuff. My aluminum pipe comes in from a country in Europe, and I\\'ve got to fill all these forms with the U.S. government. I\\'m not really sure what\\'s going on. So that\\'s what -- that\\'s the kind of stuff that I was talking about earlier. So long story short, he should -- they should respond pretty quickly to changes in oil prices when the changes are dramatic. We haven\\'t seen it as robustly as we would have thought in the United States given the movements in oil prices, and we\\'re trading to the best of our ability to what\\'s the noise in the market right now around trade. Thank you. And at this time, I\\'m showing no further questions. I\\'d like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for the closing remarks. Thank you, Amanda, and to everybody on behalf of the management team for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I\\'d like to wish you a good day. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today\\'s call. Before I discuss the Q3 financial highlights and our updated outlook I\\'m pleased to have Bob McMahon join the call. Bob is an excellent choice for Agilent’s next CFO and a very capable successor to Didier. Bob brings a strong track record of leadership to our team. Many of you already know Bob from his previous role as CFO of Hologic. He officially assumes the CFO role beginning September 1. As Didier hands of the baton, he will serve in an advisory capacity until his retirement at the end of October. Bob and Didier are working together to ensure a smooth transition. I first met Bob over a coffee in Palo Alto where we shared our perspectives on business and company culture. We had an important conversation about values and their importance in business. I knew immediately that Bob would be a great fit for the Agilent culture and of course his management style and business acumen are a perfect match for our approach to creating shareholder value. Bob has joined Agilent at an exciting time. I\\'m confident he\\'ll help us lead the next phase of Agilent growth. While I\\'m very excited to have Bob join the Agilent team I will greatly miss Didier\\'s partnership and counsel. He has played a key role in the transformation of the company and our excellent business results. It\\'s important for the CEO to have a very capable CFO. I couldn\\'t have asked for a better partner. So thank you Didier. You will be missed by me and our Agilent team. Now, let me turn to our Q3 financial performance. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter with both growth and earnings exceeding our expectations. Our core revenue grew 6% and is above the high-end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 is $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance despite currency headwinds since our last guide. This is a 14% increase from a year-ago. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.6%, which is an increase of 110 basis points from a year-ago. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of improving our core operating margins. Let\\'s take a closer look at our results by our end-markets. We continue our strong Pharma performance with 8% core growth. This is against a tough compare as we grew 10% in Q3 \\'17. We see strength across all our business groups with particularly strong performance in mass spectrometry, Cell Analysis, CrossLabs consumables and services and genomics. Growth remains robust in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. Our Chemical Energy market revenue grew 12%. We are quite pleased with this strong growth, again against a difficult prior-year compare of 10%. Ongoing market investment remains positive. This is in spite of tariff rhetoric and retaliatory policies you\\'ll be hearing in the news. From a product perspective, strength in spectroscopy, GC, CrossLabs consumables and services is driving this result. Geographically strong gains in China and Europe are leading the overall global growth. Revenue grew 3% in academia and government in line with expectations, strong performance from Cell Analysis, molecular spectroscopy, ICP/MS and CrossLabs services and consumables are driving the results. China and the rest of Asia are delivering double-digit growth in this end-market. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 5% led by strength in genomics and our reagent partnership business. This offset continued challenges in the U.S. Pain Management market. Food revenue declined 1%, strength in the Americas is being offset by declines in Europe versus a tough compare of 35% growth rate last year, and as expected, China instrument sales were also down this quarter. Environmental forensics is flat this quarter. Forensics growth was offset by the expected temporary slowing of instrument sales in China environmental. Geographically, let me first start with an overview of China. Our overall China business remains strong, growing 10% this quarter. Strength in China is being driven by double-digit growth in our two largest end-markets, Pharma and Chemical and Energy. Our CrossLab and DGG businesses also grew by double-digits. We continue to expect healthy overall market conditions. This is more than offsetting any temporary slowing of instrument sales in the food and environmental markets. The business is also strong in the Americas and the rest of Asia outside of China, with these two regions delivering healthy, high-single-digit growth. Europe was flat on a tough compare of 12%. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter with broad-based strength and stand out performances in the Pharma, Chemical & Energy, and China markets. Now, let\\'s discuss results from our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. This result is being driven by robust growth in the Pharma and Chemical Energy markets. From a product perspective, LC/MS, Cell Analysis and ICP/MS are leading the results. Ultivo our game-changing LC/MS triple quad continues to be well received. Geographically demand in America and China are leading the results. Let me share a few examples of how we’re executing our strategy to increase the depth and breadth of LSAG solutions portfolio. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Genohm in early May. Genohm complements Agilent informatics capabilities by adding laboratory management services. By integrating Genohm\\'s LIMS platform into our OpenLAB portfolio, we can provide complete and integrated informatics solutions to our customers. Customers are very focused on informatics as a way to create insight and drive lab efficiencies. We are determined to lead in lab informatics. For example, last week Agilent released the first software supporting the new standardized data format called the Allotrope Data Format or ADF for short. This format was created by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies for the pharmaceutical industry. By standardizing the collection, exchange, and storage of analytical data captured in laboratory workflows, labs will be able to transfer and share data across platforms. We are proud to be the first company to develop and launch a commercial product to support this standard. We believe the adoption of standards like ADF will both shape the future of Lab Informatics and drive the adoption of our solutions. In addition, our internal LSAG innovation engine continues to deliver. We just released the Agilent Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay kit. This new and unmatched product will enable biologists to enhance their understanding of how live cells functions in real time. We are a leader in live cell analysis and continue to expand our offerings in this fast growing market. The Agilent CrossLab group continues outstanding performance with 8% core revenue growth. Gains across our major end markets led by double digit growth in chemical energy and strong results in pharma and Food. Performance was balanced across consumables and services. China led growth in all regions with mid teens growth. CrossLab is a key growth driver of the new Agilent. We are delivering on a mission to improve both the science and the academics of our customers labs. As we expand the strength in the CrossLab platform, we are creating more value for our customers and Agilent. For example, during the quarter, we announced two acquisitions to further expand our consumables portfolio. We acquired the business assets of Ultra Scientific, a provider of chemical standards and certified reference materials. On August 1, we also acquired ProZyme a provider of biopharma consumables for glycan analysis. As you know, glycan analysis is essential to development of biotherapeutic drugs and we will now directly participate in this fast growing biopharma market segment. We continue to invest and build on our leadership position in China. We recently opened a new logistic hub in Shanghai. This hub will enable faster delivery of parts supplies and consumables to laboratories. This is the first of five forward stocking locations we are establishing. This allows us to improve our service and the speed at which we support our customers. Our focus on digital investment is also delivering results in gaining traction. Our digital channel is growing at a record pace. For the first time ever over 50% of our consumables orders are now digital. China is leading the charge on this front. We are improving the customer buying experience, expand our customer reach and driving growth. The diagnostic and genomics group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Excluding our NASD business, which declined as expected in the quarter the DGG group delivered core revenue growth of 7% against a tough compare. Let me further explain. As we\\'ve mentioned previously NASD revenues are batch based, which can make the revenue vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing of customer acceptance. As expected, the business declined in the quarter as is going up against a 45% growth rate in Q3 of last year. We expect the business to return to growth in Q4. As I mentioned, without this variability of reported revenue effect, this quarter, our core DGG business grew 7%. A few additional comments on our NASD business, I just returned from a visit with our team in Colorado. The capacity expansion underway will allow us to meet the growing demands for GMP grade oligonucleotide and CRISPR offerings. I\\'m pleased with our progress on our new facility and the strong market environment. For example, just last week, one of our customers, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Onpattro, a first-of-its-kind targeted RNA-based therapy to treat a rare disease. This is wonderful news for Alnylam and most importantly their patients. NASD remains a long-term growth play for Agilent and I\\'m excited about the future. Back to the overall DDG results. Strong results are driven by double-digit growth in genomics and strength in our reagent partnership business. Geographically outstanding growth in China and Japan drove the results. We continue to strengthen our ability to support the fight against cancer and other diseases. Burning Rock Dx received China FDA approval for their human lung cancer NGS detection kit. Agilent SureSelect reagents are used as part of this panel and our own PD-L1 companion diagnostics product received expanded USDA approval in cervical cancer. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AATI, Advanced Analytical Technologies Incorporated. AATI provides capillary electrophoresis base solutions for fully automated analysis of a range of molecules. This acquisition builds on Agilent\\'s existing expertise for providing customers with a more comprehensive set of solutions, for NGS workflows and other applications. NGS\\'s driving and will continue to drive strong growth of this new business to Agilent. With the addition of the AATI team, we create a new biomolecular analysis division with DGG. This new division now also includes our complementary microfluidics business, previously part of LSAG group. Didier\\'s team has reflected this change in our current financials along with the company financial restatements. Now, let me provide a few remarks on where we are in the Agilent journey and our near-term outlook before turning the call over to Didier. Let me start with a few comments on tariffs. On the customer side, we are not seeing changes in customer buying behavior. On the duty front, we have planned for and have taken actions to partly offset the impact of expected increases in tariff-related duties. This proactive approach resulted in a small 500k impact on our Q3 results. In Q4, we expect an impact of approximately 3.5 million of incremental duty costs or approximately $0.01 of EPS which has been incorporated into our latest guidance. Looking into 2019, if the tariffs remain in place, we plan to aggressively reduce the remaining effect via potential changes in our prices and further adjustments to our Supply Chain. For some time, we\\'ve been on a path to increase shareholder value. We\\'ve been focused on delivering strong growth, while expanding core operating margins and putting our strong cash flow and balance sheet to work in a more impactful manner. Q3 results demonstrated our continued commitment to creating value for our shareholders and customers. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results while deploying our capital as committed. We returned $291 million in capital to shareholders through repurchasing $243 million of our own shares and paying out $48 million in dividends. We\\'re also investing in the business. We closed four acquisitions, paying out $430 million in the quarter and announced two more acquisitions. This is a record number for Agilent and will further strengthen our company\\'s foundation for growth. As we continue to aggressively strengthen our portfolio via the Agilent innovation engine and M&A, we are also continuing to execute on our agile Agilent customer experience and efficiency improvement initiatives. The twin drivers of our success continue to be a strong portfolio and a customer focused way of doing business. Now a few words about our outlook going forward. The Agilent team continues to capitalize on healthy end markets. We remain confident in our outlook. We are increasing our full year core growth and earnings guidance. Didier will walk you through the details, but we\\'re raising our guidance for core revenue growth, operating margin and EPS. The Agilent team remains committed, confident and energized about our future. In our Agilent DNA is our team\\'s ability to drive customer focus innovation coupled with operational excellence. It is this powerful combination that would continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion. Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Didier who will share more insights on our Q3 financials and guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. First, let me express my appreciation for Agilent employees\\' passion and professionalism in accomplishing the mission, creating shareholder value and finally for their support for all the years. With Mike\\'s continuing leadership and Bob\\'s contribution I\\'m convinced that the best is yet to come for Agilent. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, both on a year-over-year basis and versus our guidance. On the revenue front, we did our midpoint guidance by $40 million, after excluding currency headwinds of $11 million and contributions from our two recent acquisitions ATI and ULTRA Scientific of $5 million. Our core revenue growth of 5.9% was well over the midpoint guidance of 4.25%. Our adjusted operating margin of 22.6% was 110 basis points over last year\\'s and 120 basis points over guidance and we delivered a core operating margin incremental of 55%. EPS were $0.05 about the midpoint of our guidance. During the quarter we bought back 3.76 million shares for a total of $243 million and paid $48 million in dividends. Finally, we repatriated $1.5 billion of our offshore cash. I\\'ll now turn to the guidance for fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.24 billion to $1.26 billion and EPS of $0.72 to $0.74. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 4.7% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is projected to have a negative impact of $21 million on revenue and $2 million on the operating profit. Our 23.6% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 100 basis points sequentially and up 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis even after funding the Lasergen R&D. The increase in tariffs effective early July is expected to have a negative impact of $3.5 million, as we have initiated actions to our supply chain. And those actions are complete mid-2019, we expect the net annualized impact to be approximately $9 million excluding potential pricing actions. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2018. The Q4 guidance is expected to result in the following fiscal year guidance. First, at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 6.1% on a core basis or 60 basis points over the previous guidance. The revenue guidance of $4.87 billion is $10 million over previous guidance including $22 million due to the acquisition of AATI, Ultra Scientific, and ProZyme, with currency having a negative impact of $32 million. Second, our EPS guidance of $2.70 at midpoint is up $0.05 on previous guidance and corresponds to a 14% year-on-year increase. Third, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 22.6% or 60 basis points higher than in fiscal year \\'17. And fourth, our core operating margin incremental is expected to be 39% for the fiscal year, at the high-end of our operating model. My pleasure, ma\\'am, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi guys. Thanks for all the help here and thanks for the time. I\\'d say first it\\'s hard not to echo some of Mike\\'s comments. Didier, really appreciate everything you\\'ve done being such a great partner for us, so I hate to see you go and Bob, welcome aboard. Bob, I have to say Didier is a pretty unique guy, as someone who shared some of his lineage, it\\'s going to be hard for you to match that. The questions I\\'d like to focus on I\\'d say first are very high-level for Mike. When you made the decision to raise the guidance at core, it would be really helpful for you to just kind of talk us through; here is what after a good quarter, maybe confident in saying look we\\'re going to beat the expectations that we had set earlier in the year. What really jumped out to you in terms of things going better? Great question Steve, appreciate the opportunity to share that with you. So, obviously we have a good view of our order funnel so that gives me one level of confidence which is the strength of the orders, but what really gives me a lot of confidence moving forward is two dimensions of the story here. One will be the end-market strength, both Chemical and Energy and Pharma continue to be very strong. And as you know, coming into this year, we had positioned Chemical and Energy as sort of the upside of the plan that was sort of the wildcard to our business, and there were some concerns that perhaps all the rhetoric around tariffs and other things a few months ago might actually be quite detrimental to this marketplace which in fact has not at all occurred, so I think that it\\'s the continued strength in both of those two end-markets, and I think geographically Asia led by China, we posted a really strong China number and then the Americas was also quite strong for us. I think the fact that our two largest geographies in terms of countries in China and the United States are really doing quite well, gives us a lot of confidence about the outlook from a market perspective. And I think we\\'re really positioned well to win. Our portfolio continues to become much more competitive and as you know we have unique value proposition with this CrossLab platform which really allows us to capture a lot of the growth that\\'s out there as well. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups before I jump back in the queue. One is Mike, you made a comment about customer behavior on tariffs and I appreciate the follow-up there. But it will be really helpful if you could spend another minute on it. It sounds like your perspective is that the tariff headlines aren\\'t changing the way people really think about doing what they do. I wonder if you could give us even just some anecdotes on what you\\'ve done on that point? And then Didier it was a really good quarter in terms of core margin expansion, the incremental is really good. Any color on what it is that you\\'ve seen that made the quarter so strong on that front? And how should we think about seasonality there would be great. Really appreciate it. Let me take on the first question. So, when I have been out talking to the customer base, we talk to people in the pharmaceutical industry, we talk to people in the research space, whether it be in academia and in the private sector, they plan on -- they\\'re taking a long term view of investments on purchasing our equipment, purchasing our solutions are absolutely critical for their enabling their growth plans if you will and research plans. So they\\'re not at all distracted by the tariff discussion. As I mentioned on my last call, we have seen some cautiousness in certain aspects of the chemical energy market where they were a little bit slower to approve the deals, but still getting the deals approved. It\\'s the same kind of situation we had last quarter, so no new changes in customer buying behavior. So this is coming directly from conversations I had with customers. So again, that gives us a lot of confidence about our outlook because despite all the noise and rhetoric out there, it really hasn\\'t yet affected any of the actual buying behavior of customers. Obviously it\\'s creating some work for us relative to adjusting our supply chain and production locations to mitigate the duty impact side of things, but in terms of customer buying behavior have not seen any real changes. And then Steve, on your question on the core operating margin incremental you\\'re right. It\\'s been impressive at 57%. The reasons are multiple, we started off with last year\\'s compare that was a little bit of a soft compare. We had the operating margin down a little bit sequentially from Q2. Then there was good operating leverage, good mix certainly the impact of all the Agile Agilent programs and we certainly don\\'t expect to maintain such a high level of operating margin. But in all seriousness, I think going back to few some of the things that Didier outlined at the AID meeting in New York, where he said listen, our pipeline and our programs are as robust as ever in terms of really allowing us to work on the operating margin incrementals. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hey. Thanks. Mike I want to follow-up in some of the strength in China. Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there? I think you called out environmental weakness in the slide, so maybe if you could talk maybe where there some softness. And then on the supply chain dynamics, can you maybe flush that out a little bit? I think you do some of the TC production there as well as in Delaware. So can you may be just talk about how you are thinking about potentially moving Supply Chain if you need to? Sure so happy to do so Tycho. So let\\'s start with China. Again very important market for us and we were just delighted by the strength in the business, so if you look at the six end-markets we had strong growth in all but two and then we actually had foreshadowed this coming in our last call saying, hey we know there\\'s some things happening relative to some realization -- ministries in the country nothing happened to us relative to the competitive side of the business. So we saw really strong, continued strong demand in Pharma, in Chemical and Energy, investments in Academia and Government hints back to some of the comments I made around tariffs. And as you may recall in our AID presentation, we talked about the opportunities we had with our CrossLab business and our DGG business, and you saw us starting to deliver on those promises with really strong double-digit growth in both of those businesses, and then relative to food and environmental we think it\\'s a temporary situation as related to the instrument purchases. You have to keep in mind though that they will continue to buy consumables and services from us and we\\'re just waiting to have the reorganization complete, the budgets finalized and then we know-how to follow the money where it\\'s going to go because two things are really happening here. You\\'ve got the consolidation going on where new budgets are created, being created in a new consolidated set of ministries and then part of that money is also getting deployed to what they call tier 3 and 4 cities so we\\'re following the money and we\\'ll be ready to capture once it\\'s there. Oh, yeah I forgot about that so relative to the Supply Chain, as I mentioned in my script, we took some actions actually in advance of the formal announcement of the tariffs, so we\\'ve already relocated our production for China-made products into our site in Wilmington Delaware and now we\\'re in the process of moving aspects of the Supply Chain which is also subject to the tariffs, but we\\'ve already moved the production in some of the Supply Chain. Okay. And then two quick follow-ups, for NASD you highlighted kind of just the inherent lumpiness in that business and the fact it\\'ll return to growth in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about how we should think of the ramp there next year ahead of the capacity coming online? So we\\'ll be able to, we\\'re going to try to get as much growth out of our current facility as possible and then the growth, the expansion will start to come on line in the second-half of next year. The current plan is the second-half of \\'19, you start to see some initial revenue is starting to ramp through the quarters, and Didier I think we put out a number of… So it really gets started next year and then when you get into 20s when you get the real full year ramp and Bob and I and Didier were just in Colorado as I mentioned and had a chance to also review the progress of the facility construction and capability expansion, but also what\\'s going on relative to perspective demand from customers, so the pipeline looks really encouraging. I think its part of the mix, growing with the average. I think that\\'s it. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s an outside contribution, but solidly delivering. Hi, good afternoon. And before I get to the questions another Harvey thanks to Didier you\\'ve been a great leader at Agilent and I know I can\\'t speak for many of us and saying we really appreciate your help over the years and I look forward to grabbing another glass of wine at some point soon as always it will be your choice. And Bob while Agilent has big shoes to fill, it\\'s great to know they made such great choice, so congrats through and the company. So now for the questions. On Q4 guidance, can you talk a bit more about the rational behind 4.7% core growth. This would be a deceleration versus what we saw this quarter and that\\'s in spite of comparisons that don\\'t appear much different. I didn\\'t hear anything in your prepared remarks regarding timing dynamics or changes in momentum relative to what you generated year-to-date. Is it fair to assume you\\'re baking in some conservatism here? I\\'ve admittedly having a hard time figuring out why growth wouldn\\'t continue at around 6%, the underlying rate for most of this year. So am I missing something on end markets or timing dynamics or something else? I think we decided to stay true to the guide for last year we had and even though as Didier retire. So as Didier has mentioned in prior calls, we don\\'t assume everything\\'s going to be perfect in the quarter. And again, the one that could go one way or another always has been chemical energy. So if that business holds up and it has been holding up, we should be in a good position to beat that number. >: Great. And then sort of related from a buyback standpoint, the stock was in the low-60s for much of the quarter. I think you still have about $240 million in the buyback authorized and if I\\'m not doing that math right there\\'s certainly enough dry powder there to put in place another authorization. I\\'m just wondering why you weren\\'t a little bit more active in buying shares during the quarter ? : Yes. Thanks for that Doug. I think we\\'ve -- I think the numbers are right about 240, 270 from a...  So you\\'re in the right range. And we actually -- Bob we\\'re fairly aggressive because we went outright after what we saw was a dislocation in the stock price after the Q2 announcement and bought the $200 million right away and then continued anti dilutive. We obviously continue to look at that during the upcoming quarter. Okay. And one last one. You guided us to expect China food revenue growth would start to rebound in early fiscal 2019. Based on what you\\'ve seen over the past few months, anything that would tell us or tell you that this is aggressive or maybe things start to thaw a little more quickly than anticipated? I think I want to stay with those initial estimates. So we signaled that in the last call and released our experience. It takes a good six months or so to kind of work for these things. And I think I want to hear from my team, it\\'s tracking along the same lines. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Just expanding on Tycho\\'s question on supply chain given the tariffs and focused, could you just walk us through the import export dynamic in China, just looking explicitly kind of how much of the China revenues is being imported from the U.S. and may be where the majority of those revenues is being manufactured? And then kind of the same thing on U.S. revenues anything being imported from China there. So from China to the U.S., it\\'s a relatively small amount of Agilent\\'s business. It\\'s primarily the gas chromatography product line and related support parts. So it\\'s about $100 million and that\\'s why the 25% gives us about $25 million gross impact. And then as we mentioned, we\\'re going to reduce that amount over time to even before pricing adjustments $9 million on an annualized basis. And then going the other direction, basically, China, we import from the U.S. the GCMS and many reagents in the chemistry that is made in the U.S. but there\\'s no tariff at this stage. There might be in the future and we\\'ll update you on the potential impact that it\\'s not significant really at the end of the day. So it\\'s about $100 million and that\\'s why the 25% gives us about $25 million gross impact. And then as we mentioned, we\\'re going to reduce that amount over time to even before pricing adjustments $9 million on an annualized basis. And then going the other direction, basically, China, we import from the U.S. the GCMS and many reagents in the chemistry that is made in the U.S. but there\\'s no tariff at this stage. There might be in the future and we\\'ll update you on the potential impact that it\\'s not significant really at the end of the day. That\\'s helpful. And then just staying in China, given the soft July data points out this morning including China industrial production coming in light of expectations, can you just kind of talk through the cadence of results in China this quarter? How are trends in July in particular given that data and then also the tariff rhetoric was kind of increasing during the month so just curious as you went through the quarter how you guys were feeling. Great question, I saw that same article as well, and I have based on what we saw it was having no impact so we saw no hesitancy in customers or any signals from our field that things were different. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open. : Thanks. good afternoon.: Mike, just in looking at Europe, it was flat in the quarter. Realized you lapped a tough comp there, but you did so too in the second quarter as well, just curious if you\\'re seeing changes in any of the end-markets if you could just give us a little more color on what you saw in that region? I think we did obviously have a tough compare and I do think that it\\'s probably fair to say that the region is a little bit slower than it was last year, but it\\'s dramatically, not dramatically different. I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the Q3 results. I even mentioned to Didier, should we mention the World Cup, but and the reason why I say this is to not get overly worried about the third quarter result is spent some time with our field teams and the European funnels look pretty good. The only thing that we\\'re kind of keeping an eye on is whether this situation in Turkey could actually spread more broadly across Europe, but again, I think that no significant changes in the overall market environment in the third quarter and I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the one quarter\\'s results. : Thanks. And I guess secondly, with the Alnylama approval now on the tape, I\\'d be curious as to how you\\'re thinking about the next leg of capacity expansion at the NASD facility? When you might be in a position to perhaps pursue I guess the next capacity build-out and what the indicators might be that might lead you to do that? Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. We\\'ve already made a decision to make the investments and that decision was made probably about two years ago. This is a very unique capability right into the company and I really think it speaks to the high barriers to entry and probably ultimately the margins we expected to derive in this business. So we made the decision based on our forecast of likely demand and I think the most recent announcement about success is one more proof point that the market\\'s going to be there for the products. And Didier, you want to add something?  As a compliment as you know we\\'re only firing up Train A in the facility and as for Train B which we doubled capacity, we are certainly not ready yet to push on the button the around is still an orphan drug. It\\'s not high volume we are waiting their confirmation that our customers will move into a commercial space and then we\\'ll fire up Train B. So it\\'s there. It\\'s obviously at a much cheaper cost than the whole facility built up and we\\'re certainly ready when we see that\\'s this confirmation that a lot of our customers are bringing commercial products onto the market. Thanks for the additional insight Didier. We\\'re bringing on this one train just to be clear. Next year, it\\'s second half of 2019 roughly $100 million ish kind of additional revenue then we could bring on another $100 million or so with Train B. Operator: Thank you. Our next question we come from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. : Thank you. May be a couple more on China. First off, you heard all your peers\\' report now and it does seem that the environmental and food headwinds are something that Agilent is uniquely calling out. So do you have any opinion on why? Is there a reflection of the product dynamic that these customers are buying? Or maybe just some share in a micro basket of customers? : Yeah happy to share my thoughts here. So there is something going on here. It\\'s unique to Agilent because we are uniquely the leader in the ministries where the consolidation is occurring. So that\\'s why you\\'re seeing Agilent calling us out, where others didn\\'t have probably any business there. So we\\'re the ones getting impacted the most and I think that\\'s why you\\'re hearing us call out and other people kind of rightfully not seeing it as a major issue. There\\'s nothing happening competitively in terms of sharing new offerings. It really is a macro effect where we\\'re really strong and we think this is going to be a temporary situation as things move out. And again, I just to remind you overall China business grew double digit for Agilent in the third quarter. It was the fastest growing region we had in the company. : That\\'s helpful color. And then just a tariff related follow-up. So you mentioned a couple of times that your remediation effort assumptions don\\'t get include pricing actions. So could you comment on your ability to get price in some of the affected product lines? Do you think you have pricing power? Would you expect that is a lever you could pull or not? : Yeah. As I indicated in my call price is one area that you can use to offset the tariff impact. You would have this on the more broad based as opposed to a 25% increase or whatever it may be on a core product platform. So it will be broad based and we think we have the ability to do that. Again, it comes back down to the differentiation of portfolio. If you have something truly a value with differentiated from your competition, you\\'re in a position to be able to do that. So we\\'re not overly concerned about our ability to mitigate the impact on the P&L, on tariffs as they stand right now. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. : Hey guys. I echo the view. Obviously Didier it’s been a great time working with you and we\\'ve seen the business through quite a transformation and Bob I know VJ is very jealous but we\\'ll look forward to spending more time with you as you get ramped. So may be just -- can we take out Pharma for a little bit? It seems like performance in the segment has been better than maybe what you would have foreshadowed some time ago and it feels like maybe there\\'s a bit of share you\\'ve taken and obviously you\\'ve called out some of the emerging markets strength, but maybe on a product or any other way you want to cut it, give us a little bit of a feel for how you feel like you\\'re performing there maybe versus the peer group? : Yeah, Ross thanks for the opportunity to comment on this as Pharma being our largest market. This is really important for us. And we often focus on this one product platform in this area, but the strength of Agilent we have is broad-based portfolio, and what we can see is particularly in the area of mass spectrometry gaining a lot of share both on the LC/MS side as well as there\\'s a number of new regulations that are driving growth of ICP/MS into the space, so we have the breadth of the portfolio to go after those. And again I\\'ll ask Mark to make a few comments here, but I truly believe that this CrossLab platform that we\\'ve developed really has allowed us to take really outsized growth in this space and you can start to see the numbers have starting to be quite significant and important to Agilent and Mark if you could just maybe add a few comments about what you think maybe happened to your business in Pharma. : Thanks, Mike and maybe at top level, the picture that we\\'re seeing really strong response in all aspects of our Pharma business. I think we\\'ve mentioned certainly at AID that we invested a lot in our chemistries business particularly to address the biopharma area. That part of the business is going very well, a lot of complementary pieces coming together in our chemistries business around the Pharma space at large. And then enterprise services, we continue to see strength in that area, in Pharma too and as we\\'ve mentioned many times, when they\\'re looking for better productivity or improving some of the better management of the overall assets, we\\'re seeing that and moving into the smaller mid-sized Pharmas and the biopharma companies in general. So long story short is it’s been very sustainable. I think we\\'ve continued to see high-single-digit growth over the past few years in this space, and our product portfolio will lend it that way. Certainly we\\'re planning on keeping that momentum going in the future. : And Ross I\\'d just close off on this. I think Mark has been able to develop a scalable platform, right. So discussion before used to be only focused on large Pharma with the game being over and I think the platform is very scalable to small and medium-sized Pharma as well. : That\\'s helpful, Mike. And so maybe one for Sam, you\\'ve done some acquisitions. You closed out the Lasergen interest. It feels like you\\'ve got pretty good momentum at least in terms of tuck-in M&A in that division and your division. How are you feeling about sort of pipeline on things you have in front of you because it\\'s probably the area where you have made the broadest set of things to bring in? And then from a product standpoint particularly on the companion side, it seems like there\\'s a couple of things that could potentially go your way. How are you thinking about that business? : Yes, thanks for the question, Ross. Maybe I\\'ll go -- I\\'ll start in reverse with your questions. For our Companion Diagnostics business, we remain very excited about that. We are continuing to do work with the partners that are publicly known in terms of Merck and BMS. But beyond that we\\'ve had a very active effort to increase what we\\'re doing and develop new Companion Diagnostics with new pharma partners as well as to expand the number of biomarkers. PD-L1 is very important and it\\'s an area that we are continuing to focus on. : I think you gave me some stats the other day of how many countries that was registered in some of these indications. : Yes, absolutely. You\\'re talking about PD-L1 in particular for the 22C3 variants of that which is for KEYTRUDA and Merck. We\\'re now registered in over 83 countries for more than five indications, so that\\'s good progress and more to come on that. But in response to your question, it\\'s beyond that, we are working on a number of new biomarkers with a number of new partners. So I think that there is goodness to come that we are driving for the coming quarters and coming years. : That’s right. Thank you, Mike, for that. We are expanding our footprint because the work is very real. It\\'s more than pipeline and things that we\\'re signing. And then Ross with respect to your question on general pipeline, I think I had alluded to you and actually mentioned at Analyst and Investor Day even within our next generation sequencing series of products that we have something called MAGNIS, which we’ll be introducing in early 2019, which is a platform which will automate, starting with DNA going to prepared libraries. We\\'re excited about that and that\\'s just an example but we continue to have new products and you\\'ll see it coming out of both from what’s been our traditional part of our Diagnostics and Genomics Mixed Group but also now out of AATI. So the pipeline will complement the market opportunities and we have a number of things that we\\'ll be able to share in the coming months and quarters. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. First, you made a comment regarding seeing good demand for both small molecules as well as biopharma customers. Just was wondering, as it relates to the small molecule side, is that a change in the trend that you\\'re seeing, and kind of where you\\'re seeing that amongst your small molecule customers. It sounds to be pretty good demand. And then secondly, Mark, or Didier, you outperformed your guidance in the quarter by a pretty decent amount. And assuming you\\'ve had some insight on your orders, is it fair to assume that you had stronger pacing at the latter part of the quarter in the month of July here? : Yes, how about I take the first one, right? Steve you\\'re a great reader of the results and listener because when I saw that I said, we\\'ve been expecting that the growth rates will start to separate between biopharma and the small molecule segments of our overall pharma business and we saw strong performance to small molecule. We often tie that to liquid chromatography, but what\\'s going on here is two things. One is the overall demand for the ACG services which is and consumables which Mark commented on earlier so that really is our small molecule customers may not be buying new LCs at the same rate they were, but we seen a real expansion of our growth in the services and consumables around our platforms as well as our competitors platforms. And then we also show in these numbers the demand that\\'s coming with ICP/MS related to some of the USP Regs so that’s also driving some of the growth. But I think the real story here is the ACG platform. And I think the comment was around the order pacing? : We always expect the third month of the quarter to be stronger than the other month, but in the last two-years we\\'ve been a lot more linear than we used to be, so there\\'s nothing remarkable about this last month of the quarter, this month of July. : Probably relative to the orders, I just have a thing Didier. Henrik’s team did a fantastic job on the order to revenue conversion. I think we\\'re getting a lot better at making that happen pretty quickly. Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. : Yeah, hi Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter and Didier, I will absolutely miss you and welcome, Bob. I wanted to touch on just briefly quickly on ICP/MS. Could you elaborate how much of and I don\\'t know if you\\'ve touched on this from the last quarter, there were shipment delays that were recognized in this quarter. What was the outside growth excluding those ICP/MS orders catch up and just wanted to confirm if you saw any other similar revenue recognition in this quarter as well that could change expectations for the next quarter? : I\\'d have to do the math, Didier, but I think it\\'s relatively immaterial to the overall because growth rate it\\'s about 3 million bucks I think. So I think it\\'s relatively immaterial to the overall growth for LSAG in the quarter. What was the second? No, no, we would have called those out if we had any of those. I would say the demand for that product continues to be quite strong, so and I think you can expect to hear us talking about ICP/MS in our fourth quarter call as well. : Okay, great. And my another question is on Pharma. I know that\\'s been discussed a bit here, but just looking at your acquisitions, ProZyme, Ultra Scientific, and now what you\\'re doing here with Allotrope, but OpenLab, just help us understand high-level, how are you thinking about the overall long-term Pharma growth in LSAG and overall about the LC/MS business and your expectations there to deliver in this market, just help us understand how you see this evolving in a few years from now? : Happy to do so and then I may invite Jacob in this conversation here about specifically on LC/MS, but we see Pharma as we highlighted in our AID meeting. That\\'s our largest market with the expected some of the highest expected growth rates outside of clinical diagnostics for the company. So this is an area of major focus for the company, and we\\'ve talked about our solutions focus as a company and one of the reasons why we\\'ve been able to get strong growth in biopharma is not just because of the great new LC/MS partner but we\\'ve been able to broaden our solutions offering. This is where Mark\\'s play of the consumables come in to give us need of chemistry is around our platforms. And on the informatics front, we think so much of the value of customers experience with the company is going to be in informatics and we\\'re a big believer in the importance of opening standards. And that\\'s why we highlighted that Agilent being first to market commercially because this is something our customers are moving us here and some of our competitors prefer closed environments. We’ve always embraced universal connectivity, universal architecture. So philosophically this lines up with our customer focused strategy and we\\'re delighted to be the first one in there. So Jacob maybe you have a few comments about the ultra play, but also about our aspirations in LC/MS?  : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me just start over and echo what you are saying Mike that we believe that’s a future for Agilent in the pharma opportunity. LC has always been a big part but LC/MS has certainly been an even bigger opportunity going forward. Also we see especially in the biopharma where customers is looking for high performance but also for ease of use and our Advanced Q-TOF, Bio Q-TOF has certainly shown that and we have great success with that. But we also see that from an informatics perspective that our customers are looking for something that is faster acquisition of information ease of use again but also getting a full comprehensive overview of all the data in the lab and that\\'s where, let’s hope, is very important to get data standard across all the different modalities and further than that what we have been strong with our OpenLAB looking at scientific information and controlling your -- the hardware itself now with the Genohm acquisition we also have full insight on the sample itself. So all these investments goes into that. We see a great opportunity in pharma and the LC/MS is just getting started there. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. : If you\\'d like to swing in, you\\'re welcome to. I want to focus on some of the recent acquisitions and just if you can elaborate a little bit on your plan to scale some of the platforms. If I look at the fourth quarter, you\\'re calling for a bit of a step-up in the contribution. Is there a level you think that these could contribute at just the deals you\\'ve closed in 2019 at this point? : Yes. So we believe that these acquisitions we made are in fast growing spaces and that was one of the primary rationales of why we went down the acquisition. So, for example, you look at the AATI, NGS driving that growth. And I think Didier, when we were at New York we talked about this thing going probably 20% on their own and I think we\\'re going to stick with those numbers. We just reviewed our acquisition portfolio with our Board at the last Board meeting and all of the deals we\\'ve done are growing in excess of 20%. So, again, still the core organic growth is driving the company but we\\'re adding on these faster growing pieces and I think over time even more material to the company\\'s overall growth prospects. I think we\\'re pretty excited about AATI and a couple of other things we\\'ve done, so I think let\\'s just leave it there. : Yes that\\'s sounds good. And Mike Chemical & Energy is always the wildcard in the outlook, but could you walk us through each of the businesses, how they performed in the quarter and just how you think the funnel is coming together there? : Specific to the three business groups or specific to chemical energy? I just want to make sure I got the question correct. : Okay, good. Thank you. Thanks for the clarification. So just a reminder, we think about this segment across three areas refining, exploration which is roughly 40% of the total. Then the other 60% is chemicals which also includes materials testing as well as our semiconductor base business and all three of those segments are growing. I would say the chemicals sector is growing faster really driven by the investments we\\'re seeing in the semiconductor material space. But the good news here is all three segments are growing which is not a situation we\\'ve had say one year ago where some segments really were quite constrained. We see growth across all three of the subsegments with higher rates in the chemical/semicon piece. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. : Sorry about that mute. So jus to follow-up on the M&A question. So I know you said $22 million is the contribution in Q4. I guess in total what is the total amount of revenues that you\\'ve required this year? : That\\'s a great question. It\\'s so far we are probably -- so let me just -- hold on a second.  : I want to be sure. I don\\'t try -- I have the number off the top of my head, but I think it\\'s better if I read. : Yes, I\\'m still here. I\\'ll follow-up another one which is it\\'s also an acquisition question. I know it\\'s a little bit early to start talking about 2019, but I\\'m going to. You\\'ve got deals… : No, no. I mean you\\'ve got deals, you\\'ve got currencies, you\\'ve got Lasergen, you got tariffs, you\\'ve got a lot of stuff moving around. How do we think about margin expansion in 2019? : I\\'ll refer you back to our commitments made at the AIG. We think we have no reason to move away from those commitments to be able to do this core margin expansion. That\\'s how we\\'re setting the plan inside the company and putting all the right -- we have a number of things in slide already to ensure we can get there. : So the answer to your question is with the acquisitions we\\'ve made this year LSAG, Genohm, AATI, Ultra Scientific and ProZyme those five acquisitions we are about $25 million for the fiscal year, fiscal year 2018 and then for fiscal year, we\\'ll end up Q4 alone will be around $17 million, so you multiply by four to have the 2019 annualized number. : Right, I think we\\'re just starting that probably in early phase of ramping these things, we’re just getting a few months of revenue. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Mike on the U.S. Chemical & Energy business last quarter you were kind of unsure about whether that might have been impacted by trade policies or whether that wasn\\'t really seeing an impact. I guess looking back, do you feel like tariff considerations were at all a factor in 2Q as the discussions started to heat up? And then maybe just on the overall seeing the outlook, is it fair to say that double-digits for the year is in the view? I mean I know the comp is tough in 4Q, but I think you could also not grow at all and still be at seven, eight, just based on what you\\'ve done so far. : Two comments on the first question, what I pointed out in the Q2 call was somewhat of a longer deal cycle that closed in the U.S. and I can\\'t scientifically approve it, but we thought that there was a level of cautiousness tied to just the overall rhetoric that was in the environment. That\\'s still there but it hasn\\'t changed and that was my concern as you know in the last call that actually it would go much more constrained. That has not changed. So the behavior we saw three or four months ago so it\\'s basically what I\\'m trying to communicate today is business-as-usual as relative to the environment that we had last quarter which did change as a result of a lot of this discussion in the macro environment. And while I\\'m not going to guide specifically, the C&E market for the fourth quarter, that would be our upside and it\\'s within reason that we could hit those kind of numbers. : Okay thanks. And then maybe just one more on the academic markets as you finish your year in that segment, are you kind of assuming that you stay low single-digit range for 2Q, 3Q, or do you think you see some NAH funds flowing and taking you a little higher. I know you just said you\\'re not guiding those segments, but maybe I\\'ll take a shot there. : I can just give you directionally. I think we\\'d expect to see some improvement over the Q3 number. Keep in mind, I think we\\'re about a 6% through the first three quarters of this year and typically, Q4 I mentioned earlier the strength in China relative to government and Academia and Government and then assuming that the rationality stays in place in Washington, we know that we\\'ll get usually a nice push in September with Federal Government, so the fundamentals look pretty solid there. Operator: Thank you. And I\\'m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. So now, it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing comments and remarks. Thank you, Brian and to everybody on the line on behalf of the management team, thank you for joining us today. If have you any questions feel free to give us a call in Investor Relations.

Before turning the call over to Mike, I would also like to share my plans to retire at the end of January making this my last conference call as Agilent’s Vice President of Investor Relations. I have enjoyed working with many of you over the years, but as Mike says, the best is yet to come and so it is also true for IR.  Well, thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover our financial results, I want to thank Alicia for her years of service, and wish her the best in her retirement. Alicia superbly led Agilent’s IR team for the past eight years. She has set a high standard for her professionalism, integrity, and transparency in her engagement with the investment community. Thank you, Alicia. You are the best and you will be missed by me. You can see this has been an emotional day for all of us and our Agilent team, and I am sure by the audience on today’s call.  This quarter we are reporting our strongest quarterly results since the 2015 launch of the new Agilent. We are ending the year with a terrific quarter. Our revenues, profitability, and earnings per share are significantly ahead of expectations.  Now, some of the specifics. Q4 revenues grew 9% on a core basis to $1.29 billion. This exceeded the high end of our guidance by more than $30 million. Double-digit, end-market growth in Pharma, environmental forensics, along with the continued strength in our chemical energy business are driving the results.  Geographically, our China business is up sharply with 16% growth for the quarter. For the year, the Agilent China team delivered double-digit growth and achieved a major milestone crossing over $1 billion in business for the first time.  Q4 adjusted operating margin is 25.2%, up 190 basis points from last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of the Agilent team improving year-over-year operating margins. Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.81 is $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Compared to last year, this is an increase of 21%. In addition, we took advantage of marketing conditions to purchase $86 million in stock during the quarter.  For the full year, stock repurchases stand at $422 million underscoring the confidence we have in our future performance. I am also pleased to report that the Agilent Board has just approved a new $1.75 billion share repurchase plan.  This quarter, performance caps off an excellent 2018. Our strongest quarterly performance translates into full year core growth of 7.1%, our highest annual growth rate since the launch of the new Agilent.  Total reported revenues grew to $4.9 billion. We continue to deliver improved profitability while investing for growth. For the year, adjusted operating margin is 23.1%, up 110 basis points over last year. Our earnings per share are up 18% for the year to $2.79. The numbers tell the story, a strong team delivering yet another stellar annual performance.  Let’s now look at the quarter by business groups. Core revenue grew a healthy 9% for LSAG, our Life Science Applied Markets Group. Product strength is broad based, driven by mass spec, chromatography, and cell analysis.  We continue to introduce innovative new products. We are strengthening the molecular spectroscopy portfolio with the launch of the Agilent 8700 Laser Direct Infrared Chemical Imaging System. This is a breakthrough in both chemical imaging and spectral analysis. We also introduced the Cary 3500 UV-Vis system, the first significant advancement in UV-Vis architecture in decades. We continued to build out our cell analysis business. We just closed the acquisition of ACEA Biosciences. ACEA is a provider of cutting-edge cell analysis instruments and will expand our cell analysis portfolio. The Agilent CrossLab Group delivered strong 9% core revenue growth. Demand was excellent across both services and consumables. We continue to invest in our portfolio and extending our customer reach. We completed the acquisition of ProZyme, expanding our offering in the biopharma marketplace. We also acquired our South Korean distributor. This acquisition expands our direct customer engagement and it further builds out ACG’s service business in the market.  The Diagnostics and Genomics Group grew 5% on a core basis. Strength in our NASD and Genomics businesses drove the quarterly results. In a significant win, Agilent has been selected by Unilabs to be a Preferred Partner for their pathology business. Unilabs is one of the largest European diagnostic testing lab providers. This announcement is another strong testament to the advantages of Agilent’s expanding workflow solutions.  Before I leave DGG, I want to provide an update on the construction of our new NASD API production facility. We remain on track for the initial production of GMP-grade APIs by the end of fiscal year 2019 with material revenue contributions in FY 2020.  Overall, it was a great quarter capping off an excellent year delivered by the Agilent team. A few final comments before I turn the call over to Bob. Agilent’s shareholder value creation model is fully activated. First, we are executing on an innovation-driven growth strategy that is delivering. Second, we continue to focus on improving profitability with our “Agile Agilent” Initiatives. Finally, we are actively leveraging our balance sheet to drive acquisitions of fast-growing innovative companies while also returning cash directly to shareholders. We have transformed Agilent into a growth company and are focused on delivering superior earnings growth. We just delivered our highest growth and profitability since the launch of the new Agilent.  Since then, our adjusted CAGR EPS is up 17%. Our business is also less cyclical today with non-instrument sales making up over 56% of our total company revenue. If economical challenges would arise, our business is now less dependent on capital equipment purchases.  Looking ahead to 2019, while acknowledging current trade discussions, we are expecting market conditions to remain solid. The Agilent team is laser-focused on sustaining our strong growth into 2019 and beyond. We have momentum.  I keep telling the Agilent team the best is yet to come. Thanks for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions.  Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. I am very pleased to be talking with you today on my first earnings call as Agilent’s CFO. Before I get started, I want to echo the comments Mike made and say thank you to Alicia. In my time here, she has been a great partner to me, and I truly wish her the best in retirement. She will be missed.  Now moving on to the financials. In my remarks, I am going to provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the fourth quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then I’ll finish with our financial guidance for 2019. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.  As Mike mentioned, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter to finish an excellent fiscal year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.29 billion with core revenue growth of 9% exceeding both our guidance and expectations. For the full fiscal year, our core revenue growth was 7.1%, a very strong performance.  As Mike spoke to the Group’s performance for the quarter, I will provide some additional details around our end-market and regional performance. Overall, the market environment is positive and based on our channel reach and product offerings, we saw broad strength across most end-markets. Pharma, our largest end-market was up 14% with double-digit contribution from all business groups.  Both the small molecule and biopharma segments performed well. Traditional areas of strength, as well as newer areas of strategic focus such as cell analysis and a strong performance at NASD contributed to the results. Chemical and energy grew an impressive 7% against a very strong comparison of 15% core growth last year.  We continue to see positive ongoing market investment in this area. Balanced gains in both LSAG and ACG were driven by strength in spectroscopy, LC-MS, supplies and services. Demand for our materials characterization applications continue to drive robust ICP-MS growth.  Environmental and forensics grew 17% ahead of expectations with good demand across major regions. Growth was balanced across both end-markets. Forensic saw notable demand for Cobalt Raman spectroscopy and environmental for LC-MS and ICP-MS.  Academia and Government reported 10% growth as funding environment stabilized, while diagnostics and clinical grew 1% and food was flat as expected against a tough 10% comparison. Geographically, we also saw broad based strength. China grew by 16% accelerating from the 10% core growth we saw in Q3 and as Mike mentioned, passed the $1 billion mark in sales for the year in the fourth quarter. Other Asia and Japan grew by 12% and Europe and the Americas had solid mid-single-digit growth. In addition, we continue to be pleased with the revenue contribution as non-instrument revenue contributed 56% of the total in Q4. Looking forward, we see non-instrument revenue growth outpacing instrumentation driving an increasingly recurring revenue stream.  Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 gross margin of 57.8% increased 170 basis points compared to the prior year. This was due to product mix and volume, as well as our order fulfillment and supply chain organization continuing to do an outstanding job driving cost savings using our “Agile Agilent” approach.  Operating margin including adjusting for the Keysight billings was 25.2%, up 190 basis points due to higher gross margins and top-line leverage on operating expenses even as we invested more in R&D. This led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year and more than double the rate of revenue growth.  Now before moving to FY 2019 guidance, I want to touch on a few additional financial metrics. We continue to generate very strong cash flows. This quarter, free cash flow was $336 million and for the year, we generated over $900 million in free cash exceeding our commitment.  In Q4, we returned $133 million to shareholders buying back 1.3 million shares for $86 million and paying out $47 million in dividends. We also completed the ProZyme and Young In acquisitions. With Young In, we expanded our direct sales and service capabilities in South Korea. For the fiscal year, we’ve returned $613 million to shareholders, buying back 6.4 million shares for $422 million and paying out $191 million in dividends.  As Mike mentioned, we closed a record number of acquisitions in 2018 deploying $516 million. We ended the year with $2.2 billion in cash, and $1.8 billion in debt and we just closed on ACEA Biosciences last week. So we are starting 2019 where we left off in 2018.  All in all, we entered 2019 with health end-markets, good momentum in the business, and a very strong balance sheet.  Now let’s turn to our non-GAAP financial results guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2019 beginning with our full year guidance. We expect 2019 to be a strong year overall, but before I get into the actual numbers, let me mention a few important points.  First, we anticipate currency will be a headwind in 2019. Based on exchange rates as of the end of October, we expect currency will reduce reported sales growth in 2019 by roughly 220 basis points translating into roughly $110 million negative impact for the full year. For comparison, our 2018 reported sales growth benefited by 210 basis points from currencies.  Now partially offsetting the currency impact will be a larger contribution from recent M&A including the recently closed ACEA Biosciences acquisition. And in addition, starting in fiscal 2019, we adopt a new accounting standard which changes how we present pension expenses and benefits on the income statement, in effect, reclassifying certain amounts to other income and expense. While this has no impact to net income, we do expect this will reduce forecasted operating margins in FY 2019 by roughly 40 basis points. As we move through the year, we will provide a restated 2018 to provide an apples-to-apples comparison.  And lastly, we are taking a different approach in setting guidance ranges that include both upsides and downsides. So I would encourage you to model to the midpoint of guidance at this stage. Now for the full year, we are expecting revenue to range from $5.13 billion to $5.17 billion in fiscal 2019 representing core growth of 5% to 5.5% and associated reported growth of 4.4% to 5.2%.  Currency is estimated to negatively impact growth by 2.2 percentage points with M&A contributing roughly 1.6 percentage points to 1.9 percentage points of growth for the full year.  Now on to our EPS guidance. For the full year, we are forecasting a range of $3 to $3.5 per share adjusting for the negative currency, this translates to 9% to 11% growth in EPS and a 7.5% to 9.3% on a reported basis. Included in this guidance is roughly $4 million per quarter in tariffs. This is slightly higher than the estimate we provided last quarter and is related to List 3.  A few other metrics as you build your models. Embedded in our forecast is modest operating leverage after accounting for the pension adjustment. We are also expecting the total of interest income, interest expense, and OI&E to be $10 million to $15 million in net expense inclusive of pension and Keysight billings.  Guidance is based on a full year tax rate of 17%, down a point from 2018 and diluted shares outstanding of approximately $322 million, flat to Q4 of this year. We expect operating cash flow of between $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion and capital expenditures of roughly $175 million. As previously mentioned, the Agilent Board has authorized a $1.75 billion repurchase program and we plan at a minimum to offset dilution throughout the year.  We also continue to look for M&A like ACEA and other recent tuck-ins and have the financial flexibility to be opportunistic in share buybacks as well.  And finally, we have announced raising our dividend by 10% continuing a streak of double-digit increases providing another source of value to our shareholders.  Now turning to Q1 guidance. For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.265 billion to $1.28 billion representing reported growth of 4.4% to 5.7% and core growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. Please remember that we are going up against a very tough Q1 comp last year where we grew 10% core.  First quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 per share which is roughly 9% to 12% ex currency and 7.6% to 10.6% reported growth.  Now before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying, we are very pleased with the financial results and the continued hard work and focus of the Agilent team laying the ground work for future growth and as we enter 2019 with strong momentum.  Hey, thanks. I’ll be the first to congratulate Alicia. It’s been great working with you. I guess for, either Mike or Bob, I am wondering if you can maybe help us put some parameters around the guidance for next year either by end market or segment.  Can you maybe just talk to whether, like, for example, food can get back to growth post the China restructuring? And how should we think about C&E, it moderated a bit against tougher comps, how do you set up for that next year? Hi, Tycho. I am in the room. This is Mike and Alicia really appreciates your remarks. And Bob, I think maybe you can provide a little color on Tycho’s questions.  Yes, I think, - thanks, Tycho, and I am pleasured to speak with you. In terms of the end markets, I think we still see nice end-market growth across all the markets. When we think about the various markets, pharma, we would expect leads the way, probably faster than the overall company growth, but we are expecting growth throughout all of the end-markets.  So, we expect a return to growth in food for sure, but also continued performance across all of the businesses or all the end markets. And really, we expect kind of broad based growth across the end-markets as well as our divisions.  Yes, Tycho, I think there’s this one more proof point that we think we can continue to grow the business both in terms of winning some big deals but also as the PD-L1 expands in terms of various cancer types being able to be treated by the Keytrudas and Opdivos of the world. So, it was just more of a proof point, say, this is why we have confidence. We can continue that growth trajectory.  Okay. And then just lastly, can you comment on the cell analysis portfolio today with ACEA and Seahorse. I am just wondering whether there are revenue synergy opportunities here or how do we think about the portfolio and the ability to kind of penetrate the single cell market a little bit further? Yes, Tycho, I am going to make a few opening comments here and then pass it over to Jacob. But, as you know, we made our first foray into cell analysis with the Seahorse acquisition and we really were attracted by the growth in this space as well as what Agilent can bring to really accelerate the growth of acquired assets in this space, and we are super pleased to have ACEA and the ACEA team as part of Agilent, but I am going to turn it over to Jacob and you can share your perspective as well.  Yes, absolutely, Mike, and I am as excited as you are, perhaps even more even since it’s hitting my business. And so, I should say, we started into the cell analysis business with the Seahorse acquisition followed by Luxcel and now here recently with ACEA. And all acquisitions gives us a very differentiated position in the cell analysis business where Seahorse is really a technology that allows for measuring the up and down regulation of metabolism based on oxygen consumption.  We now have ACEA Flow, the flow cytometry which is a great way and a very easy way of doing cell characterization, identification based on the genotype and what – where this would position a market is that it is very ease of use and re-allow many different labs that today feel it’s very difficult to work with flow spectrometry to really start to get their hands around that.  And finally, the ACEA has the xCELLigence platform, which is a great way of measuring cell survival viability through impedance measurement, so those three different modalities really gives us a strong position, especially in the immuno-oncology and CAR-T where they basically bring the ability to measure live cells and how they operate under different conditions is going to be key for the entailing in [indiscernible] and immuno-oncology. So, you will see us continue to invest into this business, but I am very pleased where we are today.  Yes, Tycho, you can see the excitement we have on this product expanding on the cell analysis business and I think this is a perfect example of how a company coming into Agilent with this great innovative new product and really benefit by the scale of Agilent.  Good afternoon and congrats guys. And Alicia, it’s always been a pleasure. Maybe let’s talk China. So, if I look at some of the color you gave on a segment basis, it seems like, not only did the segment outperformed, but it was pretty broad based. And when you called that, I think in the presentation, Academic as well, and some P&B, more traditional pieces of what we think your China business being.  So, maybe just give us a feel for the cadence in that business for next year and sort of the underlying assumptions and how you are thinking through some of the macro noise in whether or not tariff or anything else will impact the sort of demand curve on maybe the non-life science business next year. Yes, happy to do so, Ross. So, I think you anticipated some of my response which really was broad based. I mean, we were delighted with the numbers, 16% double-digit for the entire year, but we saw a strong growth in Pharma, Academia, which really the China government is really focused on doubling the number of their – what they call the first-class university, and so very robust funding environment. You saw the overall numbers for Environmental and Forensics and lot of that was being driven by investments in the Environmental space by the Chinese government. We are seeing a strong growth in the aftermarket, continued strength in chemical energy and returned to growth in the food segment. So, the overall view of China was very positive for the quarter.  And as we look at next year, I think, Bob and I were talking about this earlier, we are guiding - embedded in our guidance assumptions is high-single-digit growth in China for next year and despite all the noise that’s out there, what’s really happened on the ground is a lot different. Chinese customers want to buy the most innovative tools for their work.  They want to support the government-led initiatives and areas such as investments relative to healthcare for the citizen are getting funding and we are one of the preferred choices for those customers. So, despite the noise in the environment, the environment remains very solid.  And maybe on the margin side, obviously, all of the volume absorption in the quarter just giving how much you need the revenue piece by obviously whole, but it feels like still underlying a lot of what you’ve been doing across the business is flowing through on both the gross margin and OpEx line.  And so, maybe give us a feel for how much you think of sort of the margin outperformance kind of came from, maybe just the underlying revenue stream, versus maybe some of the other actions you are doing that in the context of some of the investments obviously you are going to making next year into Lasergen? Yes, Ross, as you know, it’s more than just volume that drove the margin expenses as you noted. And I just lean it over to Bob, my guess is, probably two-thirds volume, one-thirds OpEx and specific gross margin initiatives. So, as I noted in my cost script, we have a – whole series, we call “Agile Agilent” initiatives which continue to drive efficiency and much more effectives inside the company.  A lot has been focused on the gross margins of late, but also we are going to play a lot of this and we’ve been aligned this to our OpEx as well. And again, I would underlie the importance of our digital transformation are under really is going to continue to allow us to drive improvements here.  So, when I came to the role a couple of years ago, I wanted my margin expansion not to come just from volume and that’s been our mantra and our formula since we started the new Agilent four years ago and it will continue to be our approach as we move forward. Bob anything else you’d add? Maybe what to hit your mic here?  Yes, I was going to say, I think the other thing is, if you look at the various group, each one of the group has actually improved their profitability in the quarter which is nice broad based performance and so, it’s not just one business or one product that’s driving the profitability. It really is across Agilent.  That’s a great build, Bob and one of the things that we noted to our Board last week when the Board Meeting was, what we’ve been doing on the gross margins of our service business as well, which is you often think about the margins are being relatively stable and flat there, since in such a high labor content in terms of delivery. But Mark and his team are really been driving efficiency with new tools and approaches. So, it really is broad based improvement across all three groups.  Thanks. Good afternoon and I would reiterate as well, good luck Alicia. I enjoyed working together. Just as my first question, I want to dig in a little bit more on the LSAG performance. I know on the product that was flagged out was LC-MS. I was curious if you could give us an update on the Ultivo launch there and just where you think you are seeing that resonate in the market? Jack, I think I’ll let you answer this question since for one of those good news answers, so let me pass it over to you Jacob.  Yes, absolutely, thanks for that question and I mean, it’s kind of an very straight-forward story that Ultivo continues to outperform our expectations. We see our customers, especially where we started Ultivo by building applications in the Food and Environmental. And they have been very happy with what they see. In the end, you can actually, with the size of it and the performance, you can actually place three in the – three Ultivos in the same place as you previously could do with one mass spec which gives a lot of opportunities in many of the labs that actually are lacking space.  On top of that, we have done a lot to simplify and improve this software and also the usability as such. We start to see now also the some accounts are really interested in taking on Ultivo. But the mass spec story and the performance is beyond Ultivo and we see a lot also in our 6545XT bioconfirm where we now see on the biopharma side that we start to see a very strong uptake on that. So, it’s really broad based that we see that our robust reliable instrumentation is picking up in the market.  Very excited about the mass spec. But there is a lot of other elements into the overall LSAG business. The ICP-MS is also doing strong. LC continues to come back with great momentum. So, overall, we are really right now firing on all cylinders.  Great. Appreciate all that feedback. Just as a follow-up, I want to get a status update on the Colorado facility. Just help if you could parse out some of the language from the prepared remarks a little bit more. Are you assuming the revenue that starts more in fiscal 2020 at this point? And then, just on the CapEx side, how much is within the $175 million guide is being attributed to the facility there? Thanks.  Jack, having the answered the question, I’ll take the first one and then perhaps the second one to Bob. So, the language in the script was just to reaffirm to the audience that we are on track as planned. And the construction is actually complete. We are now in the process of validation. We just had a review late last week on the status and we will get revenue in 2019, but what we were just showing was the big pop up when you get the full year is going to be 2020.  Yes, hey, Jack. Good afternoon. This is Bob on the capital side and to just build on what Mike was saying. Yes, that’s – we do expect some revenue contribution here. But as we’ve said consistently the big revenue uptick is in 2020. And in terms of the capital, of the 175, most of the capital has been spent at the Fredrick site already. There is some additional, but most of that has come down and the 175 is the majority of that is still actually the base business.  Now recall, that higher than perhaps it would have been earlier because of the acquisitions that we’ve acquired. So, we’ve acquired some capital associated and planned, expansion plans there.  By the way, Bob, probably also as I mentioned specific to our second site or our original site which is Boulder, we actually have found some ways to work the efficiency of efforts here and we are actually planning to get more volume out of there in 2019 than 2018.  Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. First, just on tariffs, Mike. You made a comment about the $4 million a quarter, just being up slightly, just wondering is that including any impacts from pricing or supply chain as you doing as a potential offset? And then I have one follow-up.  Oh, yes. Thanks, Steve, thanks for the clarifying question and Bob I am going to go ahead and take a shot on this and if you need of course correct me and please go ahead. But what we are planning to quantify was the actual impact of incremental duties thereafter all the mitigation efforts.  That does not include anything else. We may be doing relative to pricing. So, that’s not a complete drag on the P&L. It’s all baked into the guide for next year, but we’ve also instituted some other broad based actions to mitigate that as well. But that was just trying to isolate the specific amount of the net incremental duties to the company.  Sure. And then, just, Bob, just a quick follow-up question. I guess, I just had a clarification. I guess, two things really. Within the 5% to 5.5% core growth guidance you are providing, what is your assumption for the incremental revenue from the NASD business in Colorado?  And then, just making sure I heard you correctly in terms of operating margins including the pension accounting change, what is your assumption for operating margin expansion next year, ex this 40 basis point headwind?  Yes, so, on the NASD, what I would look at – what I would think about that is, looking at NASD in total and the total growth rate is still there. So, rather than looking at as a sweep, because we’ve actually found incremental volume out of the existing plan. So we are expecting growth in NASD next year consistent with what we shared back in the summer.  And in terms of margins, what I would say, that’s also I think very customer-driven, because customers have one batch at the one site would for us to kind of finish the work there as opposed to going mid-term into the other sites. And in terms of the operating margin expansion, what I would say is, after adjusting for the 40 basis point reduction, we are still expecting some modest improvement in operating margins. So, what that would tell you is it’s greater than 40 basis points. Good. Could you talk about - as we – would you think about that January Lunar New Year and the – with the effects you expect out of the way holidays are rolling out, how we should think about the first quarter specifically? I know there is usually been a little bit of noise around how calendars lay out.  Paul, thanks for the question. So, it’s my hope, one year as CEO of not to be talking about the Chinese Lunar New Year. And 2019 may actually be that year. So, as you know in 2018, it caused a lot of seasonality swings between the quarters and also prior year compares. The way it’s playing out this year it’s happened in the same period of time as it happened in 2018. So, Bob, I think we are not really expecting anything unusual this year from the time of the Chinese Lunar New Year.  And then, lastly, I don’t know of this question was put in, but how should we think about tax this year and also going forward even beyond FY 2019? I think, Bob has got a really good story here. So, why don\\'t you talk to him about what\\'s going to happen in 2019, already we know.  Yes. Thanks, Paul. And so, this year in FY 2018, we ended the year at roughly at 18% effective tax rate. We are guiding to 17% in FY 2019 and we are working on plans to continue to improve that going forward.  Great, thanks. Mike, maybe one for you. We are seeing continued news flow in some of the bigger build outs chemical companies in China. Can you just talk through the market demand there? I know chemical and energy are the areas you’ve been pretty bullish on historically in that region. So, where are we in the process of some of those bigger projects building out capacity in GC, some of the other areas you act as a supplier in? Yes, Patrick. I am happy to share my insights here. So, I have been bullish on the growth prospects of China as it relates to the chemical energy markets for I think a good reason, because we have some pretty good insight in terms of the projects that are underway.  And as I mentioned, I think in a prior call, a lot of this not only to support their economic growth, but also is, what they view as a element of national security as we continue to invest in the colder chemical plants to really reduce their dependency on natural – import of natural gas for example. So we’ve seen the projects they have a multi-year program.  I think we are probably in the third or fourth inning of what those could be a multi-year build out of plant capacity. And this is really important for our GC business as you mentioned, Patrick that that’s actually is the tool of choice. And Jacob, I know you just got back from a trip to China and are you hearing the same things from the teams?  Yes, certainly, Mike. It’s really just a repeat that there are plenty of opportunity in China right now with the larger SPI installations coming in here also in 2019 and 2020. So I think, there are great opportunities in front of us also in that space. So, I guess, the message here, Patrick, it’s not over yet. So, we think we got to go few more years of really solid growth in this segment of the market in China.  And I think – hey Patrick, this is Bob, maybe just to build on that, obviously, as Jacob and team lay that ground work for putting in the instrumentation, I think, Mark and his team around the chemistries and supplies business also continue to drive very strong growth in China. So I think it’s a multi-phased opportunity for us as we go forward. And so we are really excited about that.  Great, thanks. And then, Bob, maybe, I know that you’ve been on the seat for a few months. Can you just talk through kind of initial impressions, maybe a particular focus on the margin side, obviously came into nice clean balance sheet. We’ve seen some activity there between the dividend increase and the bigger share repo is a historical trend.  But maybe just on the margin side, given some cost saving initiatives that’s been in place for a few years, what opportunities have you seen confidence level and continued expansion opportunities going years out? Yes, thanks, Patrick. I think one of the things that I’ve been very pleasantly surprised with this is the amount of rigor and discipline the organization actually comes through. We probably undermarket the Agilent approach externally. But I think the teams are very operationally focused, not just on cost savings at the gross margin line, but really through increasing productivity and efficiency across the organization.  What I would say is that there are still several big opportunities as we go forward. Obviously, still focused on gross margin, but Mike mentioned the digital aspect to this and this has a multi-faceted approach. Not only does it enable us to actually do business easier with our customers and actually drive some stickiness, it also is going to be driving efficiencies in our customer service – cost per order dollar activities and so forth.  And so, as we think about that driving, I would see multiple layers – levers there. I think there is opportunity continue to do that, as well as continue to reinvest some of those proceeds in R&D. So, very excited about the things going forward.  Mike, just wanted to – hey, Mike. I wanted to follow-up on the expectations for growth in food this year. How far along are you at this point in working through the government reorganization headwind in China? Have you fully come through on the other side there? Or are you still working through some things? I think you are talking specifically to China, yes. So, by the way one of the things also when you look at our food numbers, Europe was relatively flat against the double-digit compare. So, I know we are going to – I know your question was focused on China. But that’s – we also saw some other geographic dynamics in the fourth quarter.  Albeit said, we think the business will be growing again in 2019. We think, you may recall, I think it was the second quarter I talked about two sets of reorganizations. One, we thought what happened faster which was the environmental one, which was done and you can see that the pop in some of the growth rates we had.  And relative to the food ministries, we expect that that to take longer to get that side of the reorganization done. I think that’s still holding through the form, which is we are anticipating that kind of taken through the rest of this calendar year.  That being said, we also know some of the money is got to move to the tier-3 and tier-4 cities and we’ve been actively building up our channel there over the last several quarters to ensure we can capture the growth. So I guess, the message here is, still developing as we thought a few quarters ago. Not done yet.  Yes, I would agree with that, Mike and what I would also point to is, if you look at the performance of our China business it’s accelerated quarter-on-quarter, so. And I don’t want that to be lost after just posting a 60% year-on-year growth rate for the total company.  Yes, that’s helpful. Okay. And then, if I could, just go back to the guidance range just to make sure that I had it correct. It looks like, you have tightened things up relative to where you were at the Analyst Day. So I am curious if you can just sort of hone in, where you feel like you are, maybe 50 BPS better at the low-end and then it seems like things are going pretty well.  So I guess, and you called 6% prudent at the Analyst Day. So, why trim that 50 BPS at the top of the range? So, just as a reminder, at the Analyst Day, we actually didn’t guide for 2019. We are really just trying to illustrate, that’s really about what our margin expansion might look like at different revenue levels. But I think, relative to our guide, Bob, I think we are actually feeling very, very positive about it. I think, we came out stronger this year than we did last year. So, Bob, anything else you\\'d add to that? No, I think that’s right. I think when we think about core growth of 5% to 5.5%, that’s faster than what we are expecting the overall market growth to be. So we are feeling bullish about our ability to continue to gain share not only through launch of the new products that we talked a little bit about.  But also continued market execution across our businesses and as we mentioned, it will probably led by the pharma in China areas. But we are expecting solid growth across all of our end-markets as well as geographies.  Hello. So, first question. Can you elaborate more on timeline for the share repurchase? And any target capital structure you have in mind? Yes, hey, Dan. This is Bob. I’ll take that. We are thinking about it in two ways. One is, obviously, as I mentioned doing something throughout the course of the year to maintain our share count at roughly 322 million shares and then we will be opportunistic similar to what we had done in the fourth quarter. Still little early for me to actually come out and give a target in terms of capital structure.  But what I can tell you is, I’d expect us to continue to be very active in the M&A market and I think we have an opportunity to optimize the strong balance sheet more effectively going forward.  Okay. And then, just a follow-up on your forward-looking commentary on end-markets. So, how should we think about – in regards to pharma, where you expect strength in 2019, how should we think about the sensitivity of capital markets were to climb up here? If at all, would Agilent be sensitive to that or just walk us through your thinking on that front? Yes, great question. My view is that, what’s powering the investments in pharma, it’s really about investments improve the human condition. It’s all about investing in new classes of drugs, new therapies. Whether it be the biopharma, whether it be cell therapies, various gene approaches that are going on there. We see a new class of drugs such as the RNA-based therapeutics.  So, we think they are fairly resilient if you will to those kind of headwinds, economic headwinds into the fact they would occur. And then also just to remind you particularly in our pharma space, how much of our business is non-instrument related. So, we had a very large recurring revenue business really centered around our ACG business.  Alicia is one of the only other New Mexican on Wall Street that I know, going to miss you. So, a couple of questions. So, when you look at your segments for 2019, the implied sort of organic core growth rates looking forward is something around 3% to 4% for, I would say, mid-single-digits for diagnostic and then, 7% to 8% for ACG, is that a good way to sort of look at it? Got it. And one of the key questions we are getting from investors is, obviously is the macro has been choppy. There is a lot of angst about how business has performed during the – during a downturn. I mean, obviously, you are a heck of a lot less cyclical than you once were. But I guess, could you sort of think about that how different the portfolio performed during a steeper recession. Do you sort of like lab test it what you got now and sort of think about where we have grown in a tougher time? Yes, sure, Derik. I think, you point out, one very good point which is the portfolio of business is a lot different than it was few years ago and in fact I would sort of anticipate I might get this question. That’s why I saw a comment I made in my script if economic headwinds would occur. It’s a different company. By the way we are not at all predicating that, in fact going to be the case.  And, I would say that it would probably follow a fairly similar pattern you saw a few years ago mainly reflecting – impacting the replacement cycle in certain industries, most likely the chemical market. But while the areas where the money being spent on research, I am would think it’s going to be fairly resilient. I don’t remember the exact numbers, but that would kind of like top of mind thinking on that. Yes, maybe to build on that point, Mike. As I look at the business and the characterization obviously the product portfolio that we have today is very different than what we had before and I think it’s actually more focused on what customers need in terms of solving their problems.  And so, whether that be open lab, where we are actually helping productivity and so forth for the cross labs group just in general. I actually, you could envision where you may have some impact on the instrumentation. But that potentially could be offset, because you would actually have more consumable usage going through as they are looking to keep their instruments longer and so forth or want them serviced.  And so, I think we are in better position now than we’ve ever been and as we think about where our growth is coming from, it’s coming from the fastest part of our business – I should say, is growing, is in fast-growing markets like cell analysis that we talked about before which is going to be less impacted, I think and that’s just because of research and in the pace of innovation. Our ACG business and then obviously our diagnostics and genomics group as well.  Rob, I mean, just sort of I have been sort of- what I’ve been talking about the segment growth, I\\'m just noticing that. Back in 2015 and 2016 when oil was softer, you basically were growing LSAG in the 3% to 4% range.  So I am just assuming that, you are already building some sort of – some conservatism in the numbers, just given historically how that’s what the condition of the business at that time and the business growing was growing at the time. Thanks.  Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple trying to have a leap around a point that have been raised. I think, first, maybe on margins. Bob, there have been some questions asked about some of the specific points on the margin progression from 2018 to 2019.  But to take a step there are actually a lot of moving parts, when I think about Lasergen spending, the impact of M&A, spending on NASD, the accounting change you’ve flagged in FX, I mean, any chance you have a view on what core operating margin expansion is next year to give you – what a jumping off point might be for fiscal 2020, because I’d say, it’s never too soon to start thinking about 202, right?  Yes, gee, we haven’t even finished a call for the initial FY 2019. But I will give it a shot. What I would say is, there are a number of moving pieces. Obviously, we’ve got a full year of Lasergen built into the plan. That being said, we are still guiding full year operating margins to grow despite that important investment.  And then, we’ve got NASD as well and some of the headwinds around the FX. But when I look at operating margin incremental, so this is not necessarily core, but this would be just looking at the incremental. In FY 2019, they are very consistent with kind of how we exited FY 2018 and what I would say is, we are focused on continuing to drive operating margins, but also most importantly earnings growth. Okay. And then, the second thing I wanted to see if I could get both of you, Mike and Bob to talk a little bit about was guidance policy, guidance practice. You alluded in the prepared remarks to – I hope that people would model at the middle of the guidance range.  And I got a sense from the prepared remarks that you thought that there might have been a change or at least the need for there to be a perception of change the way you guys went about constructing the guidance for the year would be really helpful to hear you talk about how you went through that?  And why you think the middle of the range is the right thing? And then, before I lose the podium here, I will echo the thanks for Alicia, thanks for being so helpful for us as we ramped up on the story over the last few years. Thanks, Steve. And I know Alicia has been enjoying all the great feedbacks from you and others today. So, as you heard in my opening comments, it’s a bit of mixed feelings about her moving on to her new role in terms of seeing her retired and so next again used to work on Wall Street.  I still have to answer the question. That’s right. So, think about, as you can see in our script, we were leaving the witness a little bit. I think you picked up on it. So I am going to make some initial comments and turn it over to Bob. So I think it\\'s important to go back in time when we started the new Agilent and I would dare to say, we only lacked credibility in terms of a company that consistently delivered results relative to expectations.  So, Didier and I really set forth a philosophy that really ensured that we are being reasonable in terms of our outlook, but also that you could count on us to deliver it. And we now have a track record of almost four years of doing that. And I would – but if we do think it’s time for evolution of approach, because and I think that’s what Bob has brought to Agilent and perhaps wanted to share your thinking there, Bob.  Yes, thanks, Mike. And I would agree. I mean, I think one of the things that we want to do is obviously continue to be and feel comfortable about our forecast, but also recognize some of the potential upsides that we have, as well as acknowledging potential downsides and try to shrink the gap.  And that’s what we’ve attempted to do here is to actually provide a little more color in terms of where we think the business is going in terms of our performance, particularly when we just come off of some very strong business and we are forecasting strong end-markets. And so, as Mike said, it’s not a revolution, it’s more of a evolution of the guidance to help – and we’ve got a track record that gives us more confidence in our ability.  Hey guys. Thanks for the questions and congratulations and thank you to Alicia. You will certainly be missed. First for Mike and maybe Jacob can comment on this as well. As you think about your innovation pipeline for fiscal 2019, what gets you most excited? Should we be expecting to see the technology used in Ultivo prior to some of your other platforms as well?  I think we are – just like any parent would be, we are excited by all the members of our family. So we’ve got a lot of great new things coming on. I made a few announcements already on things that are happening in the molecular side. But I think we got more coming, right without sharing the specifics. So, what would you say there, Jacob? Yes, I think I will not go out and destroy Christmas by go out and tell all the presents we have for you over the next year here. So I am not going to speak directly to what is coming out. But what I can say is that, I am very proud and I am very excited about the 2019 on the NPIs that will come out there.  I think, we’re already started strong with three NPIs that came out the first few weeks in the year here between the LDIR and the Cary 3500 and also the ICP-MS Water Analysis System and the ESI. So that was actually four. And there is much more to come. So I am pretty pleased, but I won\\'t speak to the specifics yet as you\\'ll be positively surprised when you see it. I would add Kevin to your comment about the technology leverage across the platforms. In fact, that is the intent both for the Intuvo and the Ultivo. In fact, we haven\\'t really had an Intuvo question today, but I would just mention that I think we\\'ve posted 14% unit growth in the Intuvo this past year as well. Very helpful. And then, Bob you mentioned remaining active on the M&A front. So, can you and Mike just comment on your appetite for potentially a larger acquisition? And then, what your key areas of focus would be? Yeah, Catherine happy to do so. I don\\'t think there\\'s really a new story here, because what we\\'ve been saying for probably the better part of last year or so is that, we\\'ve developed our own internal capabilities and then, I think we have just augmented our capability here with the addition of Eric Gerber coming over to us from the from Danaher.  We believe that we have ability to really deliver for our shareholders’ value on the M&A we do. And so I\\'m much more confident in our ability to tackle M&A and really make it part of the Agilent growth story. So we would be willing to take on larger acquisitions. As Bob mentioned in his early comments, there is plenty of room on the balance sheet.  I think it really is more about having the right opportunities and we will continue to be - remain very disciplined in terms of what we look at. But I think it\\'s really limited – our actions will be limited by availability of active targets as opposed to our willingness to engage. Yeah and Catherine what I would add to what Mike is saying is, when we think about M&A, I think we\\'re focused mostly on the three groups in the channels and the strength that we have to be able to leverage as opposed to creating a new level. Alicia, I\\'d echo that sort of you will be missed. Quick one for Samraat, if you can give us an update as to whether you\\'ve finished with the Dako rollout at Quest yet. Whether those instruments have been fully transitioned and started scaling? And then secondly, if there is a plan to port the PD-L1 assays over to the Omnis platform anytime soon? Yes, thank you very much for the question. We are, as you know, very pleased to have earned the business of Quest and we are continuing to ramp. We have a significant percentage of that business where we\\'ve made conversions. But there is still work in progress which is actually good news, that means increased opportunity for us.  And in terms of your second question, absolutely we are. It is in our roadmap to continue expanding the menu on Omnis and having PD-L1 available on this is absolutely something that is within our plans. It\\'s something that will happen in 2019. Super. And then, two quick ones for Bob. The operating cash flow growth implies only about 3% growth in fiscal 2019, any one-timers to point out there? And then, secondly, I think there was an asset impairment in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate on where that was? Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thanks Brandon. In terms of cash flow, yes, I mean I think it\\'s a prudent forecast right now at the beginning of the year. There were no one-timers really in the - in FY2018 or the fourth quarter other than the tremendous performance that we had not only on the revenue coming in early and early part of the quarter and then also – which enabled us to generate tremendous cash flows with our accounts receivable teams and so forth.  So I think it will evolve as we go forward. In terms of the asset impairment that\\'s a small business within our DGG business and we are still expecting it to grow, but not at the level that we had forecasted. All right. Good afternoon and first off, I know it\\'s been said a bunch of times already but thanks again to Alicia, we\\'ll miss you. I want to start with a follow up on an earlier chemical and energy question. Broadly, not just in China, what are you seeing among chemical and energy customers given the recent decline in oil prices.  And a bit more of an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and relatedly, what are you assuming for growth within fiscal 2019 guidance across the chemical and energy sub-segments, meaning breaking it down by chemical refining and E&P? Hey Doug, thanks. Happy to provide a perspective on that. And, as we’ve mentioned earlier, the oil price gets a lot of attention, but it really is the view of global growth that often drives a lot of this market. But we are seeing a couple of things going on here. Well, first of all, we\\'re not seeing any change in customer buying behavior.  In fact, we continue to see a lot of demand for replacement products. So, the new generation of equipment tied to our Open Lab informatics portfolio really drives productivity. So the customers are seeing an economic benefit of the investments. So even in situations where perhaps the – there is s some uncertainty about oil prices and economic growth, they won\\'t invest, because it helps the P&L by taking cost out of the structure. So, we\\'ve seen no changes in the buying behavior and really the growth in chemical energy has been really broad based. We talked a bit about China already, but we saw and again, I am talking about the CapEx side of things. It\\'s been really broad based across all regions. And then again I would just say that the – our ACG business continues to do quite well here as well. And Bob, anything else you would add there, I think? Yes, the only thing I would add, Doug is, in terms of your question around FY2019, I can\\'t give that level of specificity into the sub-markets within the chemical and energy market. But what I would tell you is, if we look at chemical and energy, we are expecting that that business to grow slightly lower than what our core guidance. Okay. That\\'s great. And Bob may be, if I can just as a follow-up sneak in a couple guidance clarification questions. First on the buybacks which have come up a couple times. Your stock seems pretty depressed relative to your strong operational performance relative to peers on a valuation basis and your balance sheet is very pristine.  Your guidance assumes a flat share count in spite of the fact that you have plenty of cash on the balance sheet to get more aggressive with buybacks and still have room to do more and bigger M&A. I guess, it\\'s still unclear to me why you\\'re not getting more aggressive with the pace and size of buybacks? Is this really a function of it just being pretty early in your tenure?  And then, I guess the second guidance clarification question would be just regarding the tax rate, your cash tax rate is still a lot lower than 17%. I am just wondering if there\\'s any opportunity or chance that ultimately the tax rate goes a lot lower than what your guidance incorporates. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Thanks Doug. You hit the nail on the head. I mean, it\\'s still relatively early in my tenure as I am trying to figure out all the other various pieces. But what I would tell you is, I think there is opportunity now. Our primary use of cash is actually to do M&A after investing in the business and growth.  And I think we\\'ve seen that starting with the work that we did in FY2018 and then just starting here in FY 2019, with closing ACEA and so forth. But I do think we were opportunistic in Q4 and I think that there will be opportunities that we will – if there are opportunities, I should say we will capitalize on them in FY2019. And then, in regards to - what was the second one The second point is cash rate. I love this one which is yes, Doug there sure is a difference between our cash tax rate and our non-GAAP tax rate and I think Bob and the team have brought down a point so far. But I think you\\'re still looking at some things.  Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, Alicia, thanks for all of the help and really great working with you. So, if I could touch first on, just wanted to clarify how much of a contribution was USP regulation and LSAG if you could quantify that? It seemed like in past quarters, we had seen some significant contribution from ICP-MS. I just want to make sure we have that number for this quarter too? Yes, I don\\'t think we have that level of granularity in terms of specific numbers. What I can tell you is that it\\'s been part of the story of a former growth and I think that\\'s a trough. Actually a massive double-digit dollar growth. And then what\\'s your expectation there of how long of a tail that could be for USP, longer term? Could you give us a sense of how many quarters or may be years that this could last? Yes. This would be just my guess. But I think it’s probably, we\\'re not done yet. I think we expect that to continue into 2019. Yes. I think we saw a lot of great performance based on that regulation in 2018 and we would also see it sail into 2019. But we have a lot of other things going on in ICP-MS and we really see that technology being applied in more spaces now with the water regulations coming up where we have really made a nice workflow.  I think that we can see a lot of opportunities there. But generally speaking, ICP-MS is just being a tool that will be picked up from many other opportunities. So, I don\\'t think that we are dependent on one part and one workflow. But we will see these great opportunities in 2019. Got it. And then, Mike on Intuvo, you pointed out the 14% growth – unit growth here. Just wanted to get a sense of – do you want to address broader applications here? My question is, would Intuvo evolve into another set of product? Or should we expect, may be potentially a next-gen 7890 here along the lines of what you have produced in past to address then the full market, compared to the GCs that you have had in the past? Thank you. Hey, Puneet. Thanks, thanks for the question. So, I was trying to preempt the audience about it. But we are really quite pleased with the pick up or really that the double-digit growth if you will of the Intuvo product, because as we said for – since the launch, we knew it would be a measured adoption by customers, because they really want to put the equipment through the paces and really be convinced that it actually does work as advertised and guess what it does.  And now we are starting to see some really nice multiple unit orders coming in particularly as it relates to Mass Spec and at the risk of being Santa Claus or destroying Christmas or ever held, Jacob said earlier, what I can tell you is that our plan is to leverage a lot of the core technologies that were developed in the Intuvo product for potential new versions of gas chromatographs and we work really hard to keep the overall complete portfolio as competitive as possible and as you know the Intuvo covers only about 60% of the application space. So there is work to do on the rest of the portfolio as well. Thank you. I show no further questions in queue. So I\\'d like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, James. And on behalf of myself and the management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call in IR. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\\'s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Agilent Technologies First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\\'s conference is being recorded. Thank you, and welcome, everyone to Agilent\\'s first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob’s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-on-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks Ankur and thanks for joining us on our call today. I\\'d like to start by welcoming Ankur to his first earnings call as our Vice President of Investor Relations. While Ankur is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Excelling in senior leader level finance roles for over 16 years, I believe many of you on this call have already met Ankur, but in case you have not, I want to reiterate key theme he is sharing, we remain committed to sustaining excellence in our IR team and maintaining a strong relation with you the investment community. We miss Alicia, but are very pleased to have such a capable successor in Ankur. Now, on to the Q1 results, 2019 is off to a strong start. The Agilent team continues to deliver excellent results with both revenues and earnings exceeding our guidance. Q1 revenues totaled $1.28 billion. This represents 6.1% core growth against a tough Q1 2018 compare. Our performance is highlighted by double-digit growth in both our Agilent CrossLab and Diagnostics and Genomics Group. From an end market perspective, our results led by double-digit growth in the Pharma, clinical and diagnostics, and the environmental forensics markets. Our Q1 operating margin is 23.1% an increase of 120 basis points from last year. Our agile Agilent programs are driving process and productivity improvements while we also continue to invest for the future. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of the Agilent team improving year-over-year operating margins. Our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.76 is up 15%. This is $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. The combination of strong topline growth and increased margins is driving continued double-digit growth in our EPS. Now looking at results across our businesses, our Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group grew 1% on a core basis against a very touch compare of 11% growth last year. Demand remained strong in the pharma and environmental forensics markets. We continue bringing to the market innovative new offerings to fuel future growth. Earlier this month in Japan we strengthened our leadership position in gas chromatography with the global launch of two innovative new instruments, our new 8890 GC replacing our flagship 7890 GC offering and an all-new midrange 8860 GC. In addition to leading analytic performance, reliability and robustness, these two smart connected instruments offer several compelling new digital capabilities, including remote connectivity. Customers can now remotely control the instrument, monitor status and perform diagnostic tests, provide a new level of convenience for busy lab managers and chemists. With our intelligent predictive technology, we can also provide our customers with system health alerts or autonomous monitoring of instrument performance, allowing them to avoid unscheduled downtime and maximize laboratory productivity. These are just great examples of our digital lab strategy in action. Complimenting the introduction of Intovo GC in 2016, we now have the most complete and compelling gas chromatography portfolio in the industry. While early in the global launch of these two new offerings, customer response is very positive. We continue to strengthen our fast growing cell analysis business. Building from our beachhead [ph] acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience in 2015 we acquired Luxcel Biosciences last year adding new cell assay capability. We continue to invest in the fast growing cell analysis market space. Earlier this quarter, we opened a state-of-the-art cell assay development facility in Cork, Ireland. We also acquired ACEA Biosciences in Q1 adding highly complementary new products to our cell analysis portfolio. The acquisition of ACEA Biosciences increases the relevance and impact we could have with our customers in this quickly evolving space. LSAG\\'s innovation leadership again received external recognition as we drive for increased market share in molecular spectroscopy. The Analytical Scientist ranked the Agilent 8700 LDIR system as a 2018 top innovation. This groundbreaking imaging spectroscopy system takes a new approach of chemical imaging to our customers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, food and material science markets. The system delivers greater speed and clarity enabling faster, more informed decisions for customers. These new products from our LSAG team further strengthened an already impressive line of instrumentation software. We are very well positioned for continued market share gains. Our Agilent CrossLab Group delivered excellent results growing 10% on a core base of the Q1. Demand was broad based across all end markets and regions which speaks to the strength of our customer value proposition. Our ACG team continues to expand our digital capabilities for lab and improve the customer experience. We introduced e-subscriptions and a lot of customers set up recurring to consumable orders online. This provides customer the ease and convenience of not having to place repeated orders. We also launched a smart alert subscription service for the GC installed base to provide lab managers with alerts on instrument maintenance needs based on actual applications and sample volume. Over the past several years ACG has worked diligently on the expanse of our portfolio of building outcome oriented solutions and enabling our online business. Our Q1 results are reflective of all the ACG team work today to bring these capabilities to market and set us up well for continued growth in the future. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered exceptionally strong results this quarter with 12% core revenue growth. Demand was strong across all businesses and regions. Our pathology related businesses which comprise roughly half the Diagnostics and Genomics business [excuse us for one second] grew low double-digits in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to partner with our customers in efforts to fight cancer. This quarter we expanded our portfolio in high-volume cancer diagnostic testing. In Europe, we launched the first PD-L1 pharmDx kit on the Dako OMNIS automated platform. We are also working on bringing this PD-L1 assay and OMNIS to the U.S. and other markets. Our NGS related business again grew double-digits this quarter. The NASD business is also very strong. Our plan is to bring the second facility online to expand production remain on track. We anticipate the initial production of GMP grade APIs by the end of fiscal 2019 with material revenue contributions in FY 2020. Looking at Agilent\\'s performance on a geographic basis the Americas led with high single-digit growth and with low single-digit growth in Europe and China. As we expected, China\\'s Q1 growth rate is lower than our expectations for full year growth. This is owing to an extremely tough compare versus a 19% core growth last year. As you know, there has been a lot of conversation about the China market. While there are some puts and takes within the markets we serve, our view is that the overall market demand remains solid. Now turning to the company outlook, the total company outlook, our Q1 results coupled with our current view of market conditions and Agilent\\'s strong execution capabilities set us up to deliver a strong 2019. As a result, we have increased our full year guidance. Bob will share the specifics, but before I hand over the call to Bob, let me close with a few summary comments. Looking ahead, I remain cautiously optimistic, cautious as we observe the overall macro conversations about the ongoing U.S.-China trade discussion and questions about the health of the China and European economies and optimistic as we continue to see solid demand in both end markets and geographies as we continue to successfully build a high growth, high margin recurring revenue business across our ACG and DGG Groups, and as we continue to strengthen and expand our LSAG instrument and software portfolio. The Agilent team is delivering on its commitments to drive superior revenue and earnings growth. Our company has never been stronger. The guidance increase reflects our confidence in the strength of the Agilent business our One Agilent team. Thank you for being on the call today. Thank you for the indulgence of our transmission difficulties and I look forward to addressing your questions later in the call. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today I will provide some revenue detail, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then I\\'ll finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Mike mentioned, we delivered a strong Q1, so a good start to the fiscal year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.28 billion with core revenue growth of 6.1% exceeding our guidance. Reported growth was also 6% as currently negatively impacted growth by 220 basis points and was offset by M&A contributing 210 basis points of growth. Mike spoke to the business group\\'s performance for the quarter, so I will provide some additional details around our end markets and regional performance. Pharma, our largest end market delivered 10% core growth. Growth was broad based across all business groups. We are seeing traditional strength in biopharma but also in newer strategic focus areas such as cell analysis. We are excited about the addition of ACEA Biosciences, which expands our portfolio in this fast growing segment of the market. In addition, a strong performance at NASD contributed to the results. Chemical and energy core growth was 2% against a very strong comparison of 13% last year and was in line with expectations. Instrument sales were effectively flat versus mid-teen gains last year while services and consumables delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. Environmental and forensics was up 10% even as we faced a top low teens compare last year. Double-digit growth in ACG and high single-digit growth LSAG were driven by strength in GCMS, GC, atomic spectroscopy, consumables and services. And wrapping up our end markets, diagnostics and clinical core revenue grew 11% while both academia and government and food were effectively flat. Geographically as Mike mentioned, we saw growth in all markets. The Americas region delivered high single-digit core growth as our commercial team continues to execute at a high level while Asia outside of China grew low double digits. Both Europe and China grew low single-digits against difficult comparison of 9% and 19% respectively. Now before I leave revenue, I want to mention we continue to be pleased with our evolving revenue mix as non-instrument revenue contributed 57% of total sales in the quarter. This revenue has been higher growth and historically less cyclical revenue. Its contribution this quarter is more than 1 percentage point higher than Q1 of last year. We expect this trend to continue as we leverage our large and growing installed base and provide value-added services and solutions for our customers. Now let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. Q1 gross margin was 56.9% and increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Our teams have been able to offset the higher cost of tariffs with productivity improvements. Operating margin was 23.1% up 120 basis points mainly due to topline leverage on operating expenses even as we invested more in R&D. Now before I leave operating margins, I want to remind you this fiscal year we adopted the new pension accounting standard and have restated prior years for comparison purposes. As a reminder, there is no net impact to our non-GAAP earnings per share. Consistent with our guidance, our Q1 tax rate was 17%, down a point versus a year ago and average diluted shares were 322 million. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the first quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. Now before moving on to FY \\'19 guidance, I want to touch on a few additional metrics on cash flow and the balance sheet. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $174 million up 12% from $155 million last year. We deployed $375 million in capital with $248 million in M&A associated with ACEA we returned $52 million to shareholders in dividends and purchased 1.1 million shares for $75 million. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in debt. Now let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter of 2019. For Q2 we are expecting revenue to range from $1.255 billion to $1.27 billion representing reported growth of 4.1% to 5.3% and core growth of 5% to 6%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of 290 basis points partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 200 to 220 basis points of growth. Second quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $.72 per share which is 7.7% to 10.8% reported growth. And based on a strong quarter and updated exchange rates we are also updating our full-year guidance in both revenue and EPS. We are updating our full-year revenue guidance to a range of $5.15 billion to $5.19 billion up $20 million on both low-end and high-end of the range and representing 4.8% to 5.6% reported growth. This reflects our Q1 performance as well as the benefit from our prior guidance associated with currency although it is still roughly 180 basis point headwind for the year. As a result, we\\'re still expecting core revenue growth in line with 5% to 5.5%. In addition, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.03 to $3.07 representing growth excluding currency of roughly 10% to 11% and reported growth of 8.6% to 10% up a full point from previous guidance. Consistent with Q1 this is based on a 17% tax rate for the full year and full year average diluted shares of $322 million. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, this guidance includes both upsides and downsides, so I would encourage you to model at the midpoint of the guidance at this stage. Before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying, we are very pleased with our Q1 results. Our start to the year and our continued hard work and focus of the Agilent team puts us in a strong position to achieve our goals for the year. Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great, thanks guys. Maybe just to start on the LSAG growth, it came in a little below where we were expecting, I certainly understand the tough comp from last year. Can you just talk to how that tracked relative to your internal expectations and also the go forward, clearly the comp in 2Q quite a bit easier in that segment, so maybe just help us think about the quarter and then the go forward there? Yes Patrick, a great question and before I go to the answer I just want to extend my apologies to all on the phone and I understand we had some transmission difficulties earlier on the call, so hopefully it is now coming through loud and clear, but we will make sure that we address all your questions in case we weren’t clear throughout the call. Yes, relative to the LSAG growth, I think you hit on one of themes right off the bat which is the top compare. So we were expecting growth to moderate to low single digits versus this touch compare and I would point out that we had good pockets of strength in Pharma and environmental forensics. I would say there was some noise in the quarter particularly in January with the U.S. shutdown and some China trade rhetoric. There was probably some transitory impact really hard to tell exactly how much. But I think the look forward is probably is perhaps the most interesting thing which is we see good underlying business demand. The hope that came through in the scratching this up my narrative, we\\'re expecting our growth rates to rebound in Q2 not only because of the comps get easier but you\\'ve got this underlying strong business demand and we have a number of very new exciting launches underway and these launches will be delivering the revenue in the second quarter. Okay, that\\'s helpful. And then maybe just staying on the 2Q guide, maybe one for Bob, just given that the comp eases by I think 500 bps quarter-over-quarter relative to 1Q, the guidance calling for only 5% to 6% growth, can you maybe just talk through some of the moving pieces there and why we shouldn’t see an uptick in growth, just some conservatism baked in on your part? Yes, hey Patrick, thanks for the question. I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of as Mike mentioned we\\'re kind of cautiously optimistic. We do have an easier comp in Q2 and we\\'ve also reflected a higher guide at the midpoint for Q2 relative to what we had guided to in Q1. As we think about it, we are still expecting performance in ACG and DGG. LSAG we do expect to improve in Q2, but we\\'re being cautious a bit on some of the forecast and when we think about things like chemical and energy those are areas that we potentially have upside going into not only Q2 but Q3 and Q4 as well. Yes, Bob I think this is probably the highest quarterly Q2 growth that we\\'ve ever given in our history, so while it may be an element of conservatism relative to historical guide this is the highest we\\'ve ever guided. Thanks for the color, good to hear your voice not in sort of funny tone, so maybe just ticking off your comment on China, obviously there is a lot of things at stake in sort of getting this trade deal done and it seems like it is heading in the right directions, but maybe it is a bit later than what they had foreshadowed. I guess how are you thinking in general about what parts of the business could see maybe on the cap equipment side is the negativity and help explain maybe a little bit more tease out what you saw in January? So it is tough with you guys because it is sort of a non-traditional quarter end sort of extrapolate. But help us understand sort of what you are expecting over the next quarter and then against that sort of the underlying strength that still seems to sort of exist in most parts of the business in that region given sort of the commitments they have made on the environmental side, et cetera? Yes, absolutely Ross a great question and I\\'m glad to hear we\\'re coming through much more clearer and do appreciate the recognition of the kind of unusual timing of when we report relative to others in the industry. But specific to China and then maybe I\\'ll just give you kind of an overall narrative on China and get to your specific question. So when we were guiding for this quarter we expect our growth moderate to low digits really given the tough compares and a 19% growth last year and we continue to see really strong demand in Pharma and environmental. I think that environment demand really speaks to your commentary about the continued funding that exist in China relative to their priorities and this as mentioned here I will cover in a minute C&E, but last year our C&E business grew I think 34% just I think one. Relative to food, I would say, you know puts and takes of thinking in my narrative, but we are seeing a slower rebound than anticipated in the food market, but we do expect our food business to return to growth later this year and we can dig around in some more detail later if you like on that one. But I think really kind of the outlook is really the most important point here again which is, we\\'re expecting a stronger Q2 growth rate which are some small all long in terms of our guide because the good underlying demand is there. And as the comps easily move into Q2 you may recall Q2 results last year and then and that’s the narrative around was a fundamental change in our business in China which turned out not to be the case within over a double-digit growth last year. But I think if you look in Q2 you got the comp easing. You\\'ve got this continued strong underlying demand and we have new product launches that might turn into revenue in Q2. I do think that the continued to drag out if you will of the China tariff discussions between the U.S. and China, put the level of uncertainty in the marketplace and may be perhaps those customers who have more export driven activity which is relatively the only part of business might be holding back a bit. I think that – eliminating that cloud of uncertainty would certainly help but despite that, we still see really good demand in China. I think on that and Ross, just to add, I think both on the ACG side as well as the DGG side, those businesses continue to remain robust really leveraging that installed based and so I think when we think about China we think that long term the growth is certainly there. We\\'re continuing to invest in China and expect growth in excess of the total company average over the course of the year. Yes, hey Bob, thanks for jumping on the answer as well, because you may recall in some of our earlier discussions we\\'ve statistically highlighted the underrepresentation we have in our ACG and DGG businesses in China and the view that they were really poised to have a lot of long flung, just sort of long runway with all terms of exceptional growth and we\\'ve seen that through this year so far. That\\'s helpful. And maybe just tease out for us kind of how to think about DGG over the course of the year obviously LSAG very late in the year did ramp, but it feels like underlying given some of the acquisitions you\\'ve done there, given some share that feels like is going in new direction, that business could remain elevated, maybe not at this exact level every quarter, but certainly for a lot of the year, just help us sort of understand kind of your expectations for how that business will trend and how it did versus your internal plan, because this feels like a very good trend for the DGG folks? Yes, and Ross you are spot on. Your characterization of what\\'s going on is I\\'d have to wholeheartedly agreed to that we\\'ve got good momentum in our core pathology business and we could see some of the momentum building in the latter part of 2018 across the three dimensions of Sam\\'s business and we see the good momentum and our pathology piece, we\\'ve been highlighting to the audience our continued strength in our NGS business which and then consistently have been bringing in the pieces to complement that through acquisition plus also to continue organic investments we have in our genomic business and then I think the legitimate business. And then I think the NASD story is fairly well known already, but you can see why we were so anxious to continue in our [indiscernible] business and we\\'re seeing growth now and we\\'re feeling pretty good about where this business is going. So anything perhaps I missed? No Mike, I think you hit the nail on the head. We have a positive momentum going and the inorganic parts are well known, but I think I also would share that last year\\'s Analyst Investor Day and excited that upcoming next week at the AGBT conference we\\'ll be formally unveiling the Magnus NGS Library Prep, sample prep system so there\\'s a number of good things happening in DGG. Hey, thanks. Maybe just a followup on a couple of those on China, you know the C&E strength you\\'ve talked about for a while there, how much of the strength in China for C&E do you think kind of offset broader C&E softness? And then can you kind of quantify that the food ministry catch up you are expecting this year from the issues last year? Yes, Tycho it is good to hear from you and happy to address the question. So just to clarify, the C&E business for Q1, actually China was not a very strong contributor to the growth in Q1 that we saw in C&E. What we\\'re referring to was a strong growth rate last year of 34%. That being said as you know we remain very bullish on the prospects of the chemical and energy business in China and I would just say they are just all about the comps. And perhaps waiting for this new product to hit the market, so as you know the 8890 GC and perhaps we will have you share a few comments about that in a minute Jacob, but the 8890 GC is primarily targeted at the chemical and energy space. So we expect in the latter part of this year the China chemical and energy business we think is really a [indiscernible] going on here to be fundamentally strong. So I would not have reacted during the first quarter actually a story of tough comps. And the story in the food market, as you may recall last year we had talked about, hey we think this reorganization is going to take probably nine months or so to kind of go through the system, I think we got that part of it right which was they were going through process of consolidating into one set of industry, from multiple agencies into one single agency. So that has happened pretty much that\\'s essentially complete with most but not all the leaders in place. What I think is taking a little bit longer is the internal review of elimination of redundancies across our modern labs, so that\\'s really leading to slower to new instrument purchases in the – if you will the central government segment of that market. So this is really affecting the China central lab purchases while the private sector piece of it, the contract testing lab throughout the market continues to grow and we do expect the entire food business inclusive of the central agencies to be back growing again lateral this year. Yes, certainly, and back on to the chemical and energy you are absolutely right Mike that we continue to see lot of programs in place and projects in place for – in China. So we expect a lot of opportunities in that space also going forward as I also mentioned last time. But we are of course very excited about the new 88 series, not only is it what we call the smart connect and really we\\'ve put a new class in of smart connected instrument and which is a key component in our digital lab strategy. But what also gives us now is a great opportunity for the huge installed base we have out there with the 7080s we have a very strong start throughout and refresh the installed base. Now everybody would like to upgrade to an even better solution. It is well known technology, so you can very easily transfer your methods from the 7080 over to the 8080, but there is a lot of new features we have added into this. All the technology we have invested in Intuvo is now coming to full effects here and all the units smart connect what we talked about, first of all you can have the remote monitoring, but yes, really we have built in a dual core processor and what it does really is that it allows you to continuously having one processor continues to monitor the health of the instrument which allows you to really understand what is going on, get the smart alerts so you can really upfront understand what\\'s happening. You can reduce your unscheduled downtime and this is a huge opportunity for the labs out there. So we are really excited and I can tell you our customer is at least as excited as we are right now, we see a lot of demand for it. Yes, and Tycho the discussion we\\'re having inside the company is this has been a decade in the making. Yours truly actually was the GM when we came out with the 7890 product which hit the market in 2007. So you can see the amount of advancement made since that time and how we\\'re leveraging the initial investments we made in Intuvo GC platform. Okay and then if we think about the current quarter, I appreciate the color you\\'ve provided on guidance, any impact from Chinese Lunar New Year? And then you mentioned the government shutdown, we\\'ve heard one of our peers talk about ICP-MS impact there, any impact on your business there? Sure, happy to talk about also, for the first time in a number of years we\\'re not talking about Chinese New Year in our earnings call so nothing unusual happened this year relative to the dates moved around between quarters and obviously it moves the numbers around for compare, so nothing unusual happened relative to the business flow if you will as a result of the Chinese New Year. And I mentioned some of the noise around the U.S. Government shutdown. I\\'d mention two things. First of all just a reminder, when you look collectively at the entirety of all the U.S. Government agencies, U.S. Government is our largest customer and they were basically out of pocket for months. And I think what you may be pointing to Tycho, with some of the products require an export license from the U.S. Government, so obviously that didn\\'t happen. And some of that product didn\\'t find its way into China into Q1 because we didn\\'t have the export license. That\\'s just a transitory thing. We\\'ll see that flow through and overall it is really, really immaterial to the company\\'s quarterly results. Thank you. Another question on geography, can you comment on how the results in Europe arrived versus your internal expectations? Yes, Dan. It was good to hear from you, right where we thought it would be as we came in to this year we were expecting low single digit growth in Europe and I think it\\'s really been on that pace as well. So I don\\'t think really anything unusual there. Obviously, we\\'d love to see some resolution on some of the political uncertainty, but I think the numbers basically came in as planned. Bob? Okay. And then for my followup, I appreciate all the color on the new gas chromatography launches, can you help us understand the anticipated adoption curve there? Is this something similar to the Intuvo where it\\'s very slow and steady at the outset bell curve shaped or is this something where we could see a more immediate impact within the scope of 2019? Thank you. Dan, I\\'m so glad you asked that question. So this is actually a much different scenario. We can expect a quicker ramp of orders here and in fact but Jacob I think we\\'re actually starting to ship right? Yes, we did sponsorship this week here, so this is happening. We, as I mentioned before it\\'s based on our proven technology and so it\\'s very easy to transfer methods. Actually you don\\'t have to do anything, so you would actually expect most customers, that was looking for 70, 80 probably pretty quickly move over to 88. We do see some customers that are conservative that is a production that want to wait maybe a few months, but this… Yes and we still have a lot of conviction on the game changer Intuvo GC, but we do see the adoption rate to be here much more quickly than the Intuvo ramp because there\\'s really a direct replacement with new capabilities for our 1790 and 7820 offerings. Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, can you speak to the services growth in the first quarter and perhaps some of the tractions you might be seeing with the multi vendor services in China? Yes, so I\\'m going to make a few comments here, then I\\'m going to invite Mark to join in on the call to sort of take a bow in front of the investment community. So we\\'re seeing great traction in the overall ICG business and services and in China in particular. So I think it is all regions and across the entire portfolio. So this has been the results of a lot of work over the last several years really to provide to the marketplace a set of offerings that really helps them with running their operations of the lab and also with the great science they\\'re doing, so we think we\\'ve got momentum. We think this wasn\\'t just a one quarter phenomena and our outlook is pretty positive here. So Mark, anything else you\\'d add to that? Thanks Mike and I\\'ll add a couple of things. As you suggested we\\'ve seen strong growth not just in what we\\'ve talked about in our enterprise or multi vendor arena, but in our instrument services business. Both of them were double-digit growers in this particular quarter and maybe a bit nuanced about the portfolio expansion. So as Mike talked the value-added services that now are more formulated around specific end markets and in Jacobs business in particular and the extension of a lot of the capabilities we actually talked to an aide in terms of how we\\'re going to introduce an expanding portfolio around our CrossLab Connect and asset monitoring utilization services. As far as China is concerned, I\\'m extremely bullish about China still. I think we\\'re - I know you\\'d like to talk about which innings we\\'re in, I still think we\\'re in the early innings in China in the enterprise space. And it\\'s really ripe in the sense that they\\'re looking for many of the same things we\\'ve seen across our global accounts and they have the size and scale of the assets in the lab now to do things with it. So very encouraging in China and I think we\\'ll see in the foreseeable future will be strong growth there. And then a quick follow up for Bob, can you just help us bridge the core incremental operating margin year-over-year in the first quarter in terms of the impact of FX, M&A, tariffs on the incremental year-over-year? Thank you. Yes. So yes let me give you a couple of data points there. So the majority of the operating margin expansion was through our operating expense. The tariffs were about roughly $4 million in the quarter which was in line with what we had expected. So year-over -year that\\'s a $4 million kind of headwind. M&A, if you include the Lasergen was also about $3 million or $4 million all in a reduction year-over-year as well. And then the tariffs were offset by productivity enhancements and gross margin and you saw that. And then the R&D we actually spent more in R&D, but we\\'re able to offset that through productivity savings and our SG&A through our Agilent programs. And so, that hopefully gives you kind of a sense for the 120 basis points improvement. It was really on top - on the strength of the top line driving leverage in our core operating expenses as well as being able to offset that tariffs and the investments that we\\'re making in R&D and the new businesses really driving more efficiencies in the G&A areas. Hey Bob, you did a little bit of share buyback activity in the quarter. Just sort of some commentary on maybe being a little bit more aggressive on that given your strong cash position and just sort of some general thoughts on capital deployment at this moment in time? Yes, so I\\'ve been with the company now for about six months and you know as I think about that we were active in the quarter. I can see us between M&A which is our primary focus of utilization of capital in the back half of the year between M&A and/or share repurchase I would expect us to be probably a little more active. That\\'s not built into the guide Derik. We prefer to use that cash and the strong balance sheet that we have on growth assets as we did over the course of the last 18 months, but we do not see ourselves continuing to hold a significant cash balance. And I guess along those lines, I mean you\\'ve done a number of deals in the genomic space recently in the cell biology space. I guess when you look at the portfolio are there any other target areas, things or I mean I\\'ve asked this question in the past and I\\'ll ask another version of it, but it\\'s like you are relatively underweight versus some of your peers in the academic and government market and just wondering if that\\'s a primary focus of your M&A activity? Yes, Derik, I\\'ll jump in on this one. So actually some of the deals we\\'ve done have been really targeted academic, whether it be Seahorse Biosciences, the iLab. So we like that space, but I\\'d say it\\'s more from a collective end market, market view. And so, I think you hit on a couple of areas that we\\'re interested in, the genomics and the cell analysis. Cell engineering is an area of interest for us. We also think there is things we can do on the ACG consumables portfolio and also remain very interested in informatics as well. So we think there\\'s a lot to be, luster out there that kind of fits our model of companies that are primarily in the private space that really would welcome being part of the Agilent culture. Let me just add something real quick there. I think the beauty of it is, I think as we look at our portfolio of funnel of opportunities it\\'s really across all three of our business groups, not just focused either on the genomic side or other places. And I think you\\'ve seen that through what we\\'ve been able to do really leveraging the strength of Agilent as you said and I guess your next question is around Lasergen. Yes, I got to say with AGBT coming up and just while thinking about the sequencing space can you give us an update on what\\'s going on at Lasergen and when can we expect to see some first data? Yes sure. I mean just I\\'ll start with a reminder Lasergen is important to us but it\\'s one of many R&D programs both within Agilent even within DGG. We are on track. We\\'re meeting our internal expectations. We\\'re really pleased with the progress that the team is making. You won\\'t hear anything specific that we\\'ll talk about at AGBT. We\\'re tracking along and more to come in the course of the coming years. I want to keep it going on DGG the growth there in the quarter which is great. The first factor you laid out was that NASD was the largest year-over-year contributor. So I\\'m curious where you\\'re finding incremental capacity at the old site and just update us on the timing related to the new capacity of the new site? Yes, so I might just go ahead and handle this one, you can jump in on it, but we brought in a new general manager probably about 24 months ago and really came in and looked at our existing facility and saw opportunities from we call our agile Agilent program, but from our process improvement we said, hey there is more that we can garner in terms of growth out of the existing facility by really changing some of the aspects of how we conducted the manufacture. I think we\\'ve been able to actually if you will squeeze more out of the existing sites than we had thought. And then relative to the status which is the same I think we\\'re still on track for bringing this on online by the end of this fiscal year in terms of producing GMP grade material. The site construction is essentially finished. We\\'re now in the midst of validation which is really quite a task given the scale of what we\\'ve constructed here, but still doing good. Yes, and Mike you said it all. We, operational excellence was in I think full order in Q1 and we\\'re making really good progress for opening of our second facility. Great. And just to followup I guess on the second factor which was the pathology business the double digit growth seems like a nice acceleration there. Can you talk about, what you\\'re seeing on the competitive environment and utilization of the instruments that are around in the field and maybe just finally, where do you think you stand with the question all out to that help in the quarter? You got it Mike. Overall the combination of our pathology related businesses, our core business that we have which is our systems are consumables to go along with it, including companion diagnostics, including we call reagent partnership, altogether a very, very strong quarter that we had. To answer some more of your specifics, we\\'re seeing you know really good performance related to our advanced staining portfolio. And as you indicated a lot of that we are seeing increased pull through and our core systems are on this platform is doing well. And you alluded to that we have seen the adoption and growing utilization at Quest, but there\\'s also a similar effect that we\\'re seeing at other major centers and we continue to see goodness from PD-L 1 and 2 in partnership that we have with a number the pharma partners that you\\'re aware of including Merck and BMS. So it\\'s not just one thing but there\\'s general strength across our pathology business that we\\'re pleased with. Jack, I think that was the thing that was probably one of the most gratifying, it was really across all of the business lines within DGG. It wasn\\'t being driven by one or just a handful, it was really across, it was a nice performance. Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. Just curious what did China grow excluding the food headwinds and then what are you expecting for China growth for the rest of the year? So I think the growth for - outlook for total China is the same as it was at the beginning the year which was above the overall corporate average I think high single digits is what we\\'ve been probably looking at. Yes and I would say you will get the exact number but it would have been mid single digits ex food. Okay and then as we approach the Brexit deadline and given you uniquely have a month of that impact in your second quarter if the timeline holds. Can you just remind us of your exposure to the UK and any areas of your business that could be impacted by the exit? I think Bob, I recall it is about 4% of our total businesses in the UK from I discussed in the last year and the main flow through would be getting product into my main major impact I\\'ll be getting product into the UK for - to our UK based customers and we actually have a series of contingency plans, we\\'re actually already executing on which assumes a hard Brexit. So we\\'re planning for worst case scenario which means making sure we have in country stocks and other things to help our customers with potential challenges getting in product through customs. We do have a relatively small factory in the UK for our Raman spectroscopy business, but we\\'re in the midst of transforming that product into Malaysia. So I think from the outbound export side of things probably would be not a good start right Jacob? So I think the bottom line there is, I think we\\'ve got good plans in place. We\\'re not expecting that to have a material impact in the quarter. Hi, good afternoon. Two questions for you. First I guess just as it relates to tariffs, I heard you say you saw a $4 million impact in the quarter. I was just wondering if you were assuming the tariff to step up to 25% in your initial guidance there or what are you thinking about tariffs as of right now over the remainder of the year? And then I have a followup question related to some products. Yes, great, thanks Steve. Yes, so we are assuming that it will ramp back up to 25% at the end of March and then for the rest of the year. And so, we built that into to our guidance. So if something happens there this - such a trade either gets delayed, that would be potential upside for us. I think more importantly just removing the uncertainty of what that looks like I think we\\'ll free the market just in general and it\\'s probably less about the dollars associated with the tariffs and more associated with just kind of clarity about what path we\\'re going to be going forward. Sure. That\\'s helpful. And then secondly just on products, could you provide a little bit more color on kind of your GC portfolio now and with these new 88 systems kind of where the Intuvo offsets versus these newer systems. And then also just with this new Magnus system maybe how that fits into your existing genomic portfolio and what you\\'re expecting out of that product over the rest of the year? Yes, that\\'s a good question and now we have - we really have three main solutions in the GC space. We have the Intuvo which really goes after the ultimate ease of use with hyperactivity especially combined with mass spec, so that\\'s that great area for the routine use with Intuvo. Then we have the 8860 which is focusing more on a routine application which are more of the standard ones, but also demands some type of ease of use and allow us also to play in the midrange space. And then the 8890 which is the high - where we have customers requiring high flexibility and performance that needs very high requirements and performance in the space which is really HPI space and other elements that\\'s where its more complex. So these are really the three areas we play it\\'s all now based on the same core technology with smart connectivity and remote access and all those built-in health monitoring capabilities, so it fits very well together. And the same ease of use platform. Yes, with respect to the Magnus, thank you for the question. Well, first of all what we\\'re going to be providing the system is something that we don\\'t have and actually there\\'s very few solutions like it on the market specifically the customer is going to be able to start with a shared DNA and that\\'s what they put into our automated prep system and what they get on the other end is a fully prepared library that\\'s ready to go that they can load. And so, what that means specifically is we\\'re doing both the library preparation and the target enrichment fully in an automated fashion in our Magnus system. Like I mentioned before, we\\'re going to formally launch this next week at the AGBT conference and then we\\'ll start taking orders immediately thereafter. But our shipments will be in a deliberate fashion starting in the June, July timeframe, making sure for our first set of customers we really get a lot of care to ensure the success that they would expect that we\\'d expect. So it is targeted to clinical labs and other NDS testing labs and I think we\\'ll definitely see some impact of installs by the end of this year, but really a bigger impact in 2020. The question I have is, I get the strong compare on chemical energy, but I just wanted to get a sense, I\\'m wondering if you saw any impact from customers waiting and knowing about 8890 and 8860 and holding back those purchases and having any impact in the quarter? And then also I have a followup for Bob on margins, thank you. So Puneet, I think you must have been listening very carefully to my comments, the slight, the scratching is coming through. So I kind of alluded to that which is and it\\'s hard to put a quantitative number on it, but we clear things that happened which is, this product has been 10 years in the making, a decade in making I\\'d like to say and of course our customers knew it was coming and I think some may choose, as Jacob mentioned, to go with the 7890 right now because they are there they still want to see the new product, but we think that there was a quick uptake in 8090. So that may, I think that is part of the story, can\\'t quantitate [ph] it, but also again one of the reasons why we were optimistic about our ability to get some good growth and back to growth in the chemical energy beyond what we saw in Q1. So I think there\\'s more to the story than the tough compares. Thanks, so we should expect this to come, I mean come in into the next quarter now that you\\'re shipping this out? Yes, yes, yes, that in fact Jacob just dropped me a note the other day and we started shipping this week. Okay great. And then Bob, just some I wanted to get a sense from you on, you commented about 57% being consumables recurring moving up by a point and sort of gross margin contribution there. I wanted to understand, now that you have had some time to look at the overall portfolio and the new products and Intuvos and 8890s and what\\'s your sort of gross margin expectations sort of longer term, obviously these are, they have improving margin profiles, so I\\'m just trying to get a sort of a high level corporate view that you\\'re seeing in gross margin improvement longer term? Thank you. Yes, I mean I think if you look over the course of the last couple of years we\\'ve had significant gross margin improvement really through the great work that the operations team has been able to drive. And then also the pricing discipline that the commercial teams have been able to do as well as positive mix. This quarter you saw that moderate really because of the tariffs and if it weren\\'t for tariffs we would\\'ve had I think some very good gross margin improvement. I think once we anniversary gross margin, the tariffs this year which would be in Q4 you\\'ll start to see gross margins go back up for the things that you talked about as well as just the ongoing operational improvements that we have. We had guided to call it modest, call it 50 to 70 bps on a restated basis operating margin improvement, a combination of both gross margin and an operating expense improvement for the full year. In Q1, we were ahead of the game which is good news and a lot of that came through the operating expenses, but I would expect us to probably be about this range and probably be a little stronger in the back half of the year as we anniversary the tariffs on gross margin. But going forward, I would see us really focus on growth driving margin expansion in that 50 to 70 basis points being kind of evenly split between the gross margins and operating expense line. Hi, this is Ryan out for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Another great Pharma quarter. Can you remind us what proportion of your Pharma revenues are now to large molecule customers? And contrary to recent quarters you didn\\'t call out small molecule growth within Pharma. Can you talk about what you\\'re seeing from those customers and is healthy growth within the small molecule segment finally slowing down a bit or is that a little premature? Yes, Ryan so great observation. So the ratios have changed somewhat over last three years. I think it speaks to the strength of not only the biopharma space, but how we\\'ve been picking up share. But to answer your question, it\\'s 80/20 mix about 80% small molecule 20% is the biopharma space and the slowdown in LC that\\'s already happened, we saw that in 2018 and as you know, we\\'ve been talking about the breadth of our portfolio and how a lot of our analysis has moved. It\\'s not the driven demand for LCs but it\\'s not the double digit growth we thought for a while with strong demand on the mass spec side. You may recall that was one of the reasons why we had such a blow after Q1 last year when we had a strong finish the prior year in LC/MS. So I think the breadth of the interim portfolio what\\'s going on in the in the ACG business in terms of our enterprise business as well as this is where a lot of our NASD growth shows up. And by the way I think you also have some new solutions coming out in this space as well Jacob right? Yes, what came out here recently was more for the small molecule, Mike and Q-TOF. So what we came out a year ago was the Q-TOF for the last molecule, we had advanced bio and we\\'ve had a lot of success with that coming out with a full solution. We\\'re now taking that technology and have focused that into to also address small molecules, within specifically within the food environmental market but also in the academia research. So the success we had where we started out in the biopharma and one of the first early movers into the biopharma space, particularly focused on discovery and R&D. We now, we of course will continue to invest into the biopharma space also going forward. Right. And that was perhaps more of an oversight in terms of calling out the [indiscernible] narrative with a 10% overall growth in pharma, small molecule also was healthy. Yes, very helpful. Thank you. And Bob you noted earlier in the call that you don\\'t expect to maintain a significant cash balance over time. Can you give us a sense for what significant means, how do you think about the minimum cash balance for the business and when should we expect to hear more on your plans to deploy your current excess cash? Thank you. Yes, I would say later on this year as I get through kind of the rhythms of the business in terms of as we get a better feel for that. What I would say right now is we\\'re in a net cash position. We actually used more cash than we generated in Q1. I would expect that to continue over time. I don\\'t see us using it all in one quarter, but we will continue to deploy our capital in a growth oriented way. We continue to drive dividend growth, but I think just as importantly and probably more importantly investments in faster growing areas to augment our strong portfolio already and then couple that with share buybacks. Good, you seem to be doing more M&A. Is that a change in philosophy? Is it a change in markets that you are perceiving? What\\'s behind this activity? Yes. Thanks for the question. So this is a conscious decision I made and we started sort of laying the foundation with Sam coming into that role and continuing now with a new hire in Eric Gerber. And what my view was when I first came into this role I really had to get the foundation this company established and I think we\\'ve got our core operations under control, we\\'ve got our pipelines, our R&D roadmaps redone. We\\'ve got a whole new way of operating the company or running this company. And you\\'ve seen it in the early years in terms of the results we delivered, but we also have this opportunity to use this great balance sheet we have to, as Bob described it to acquire growth assets. So I think the company from a foundational standpoint is in the position to be more acquisitive. I also believe that we have been building the muscles in terms of actually making the acquisitions work for the company. And we continue to work to get better at this and are very active in the market. I think we did a record number of acquisitions last year and you can start to see that it\\'s paying off in terms of material impact to our growth rate. Again our model doesn\\'t require M&A, but is a nice adder. And as Bob mentioned, I\\'ll just re-emphasize this, we\\'re looking to go into markets and acquire businesses where they can leverage the One Agilent model of innovation and where the acquired companies have something of a difference in nature, have a differential team and are in the segments of the market that are growing faster than the overall company. We passed on opportunities where assets were available and we didn\\'t really see a path to grow. We are a growth company and that\\'s the type of assets that we want to acquire. So it was a conscious decision and I think we plan on continuing to be active in the market. And lastly, could you give us a refresh on Lasergen. Is that going after the diagnostics market, what will be their position? Thanks so much for the questions. Yes, I think I know this one sort of go ahead and handle this one, but our strategy here is that right now we\\'re a component supplier into the NGS workflows of some of our major competitors and have built a business in excess of $250 million. Our view is that ultimately we see a view where you need routine market that you are going to need to have a turnkey easy to use workflow solution. We have a lot of the components of that already and you may recall that from Sam\\'s overview at our Analyst Day back last year. The missing piece was to actually have a sequencer. So our thoughts are not to compete box-to-box in the sequencer business, but really try to build the best workflow for that cancer diagnostics marketplace. Hey Mike. On chemical and energy, just honing in on your comments on instrumentation, I\\'m curious where you would put penetration or replacement for the Intuvo at this point and if you\\'d be willing, what do you think could be the contribution either at the segment level or for the overall business? Yes, so I think when you think about the chemical and energy market I think we want to primarily think around the 8890 and 8860 portfolio, because that really is the target market for this product and that\\'s why I went to great length in my narrative which probably nobody was able to hear because of our transmission difficulties, but that this really is right after the mainstream chemical and energy market, the Intuvo is really geared towards those high volume routine labs in food and environmental really a mass spec based analysis where the chemical and energy market tends to be more gas GC only kind of marketplace. So we\\'re really excited about the product. I won\\'t give you a specific number, but I can say this is one of I believe the proof points why we believe there perhaps is some upside to our current outlook on chemical and energy which believe, I think Bob we\\'ve got a low single digit for the year. Yes, and I think, Dan to your question, none of these individually is going to move the needle on the total company, but collectively the portfolio of new products that are being introduced, not only in LSAG, but across our portfolio is really what\\'s helping us sustain and feel confident that our growth is going to continue above market levels just because of the value proposition that these are able to provide in the marketplace. Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then Bob, if I could on the out margin forecast, it sounds like you\\'re on track operationally for the NASD build out. I\\'m just curious if you think the $12 million or so in investment that you\\'ve targeted last year as the 2019 spend holds? Yes. In general that is - that\\'s consistent with, we haven\\'t changed the forecast there relative to what we had said at the beginning of the year. All right. That wraps up the call for today. Thank you for joining. If you couldn\\'t get to something because of the transmission issues or have any of questions, please reach out to us in the Investor Relations. Thanks very much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\\'s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Agilent Technology Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator instructions]. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, today\\'s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\\'s conference, Mr. Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Liz. And welcome, everyone to Agilent\\'s second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO and Bob McMahon Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob’s comments, will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-on-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of April 30th. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Ankur, and thanks for joining our call today. Our Q2 results are mixed. On one hand, we continue to deliver strong growth in two of our three businesses. On the other hand, our LSAG business is experiencing unexpectedly soft market conditions. Despite revenue below our expectations, the Agilent team delivered solid earnings with EPS of $0.71 at the midpoint of our guidance. This represents 9% EPS growth over last year. We also delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. For the quarter, total revenues were $1.24 billion, representing 4% core growth. Let me break that down; performance was led by our Agilent CrossLab Group with core growth of 9%; our Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 6% core growth, while our LSAG business declined 1%. There were two key market factors observed in the latter part of the quarter that contributed to the LSAG revenue shortfall; first, we experienced a slowing of internal orders in China; the second factor is tied to more general slowdown in orders from big pharma. I\\'d point out that this slowdown became apparent to us at the beginning of April. Let me explain this in little more detail. In China, our overall business grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in ACG. However, our LSAG business declined by 1% during the quarter. There are two major factors impacting our China LSAG business. First, the recovery in the food market has not yet materialized. Government labs have not yet resumed purchasing at the levels we have previously seen. Second, the Chinese government\\'s 4 + 7 initiative to lower generic drug prices is having a greater than expected impact on small molecule pharma. Consequently, we\\'re lowering our revenue expectations in China this year. China does, however, remain an important long-term growth market for us. The other factor affecting LSAG growth is moderating global demand in small molecule pharma. We\\'ve seen several large accounts delay and replace in purchases. In contrast, the small molecule pharma would continue to see strong global bio-pharma demand. While overall growth declined 1% there are positive signs in other LSAG end markets, demand remained strong in environment forensics and biopharma markets with solid results in chemical and energy. You\\'ll recall we strengthened our leadership in gas chromatography with the recent launch of the new 8860, 8890GCs. Since the launch, we were very pleased with the stronger than expected customer demand we\\'ve seen. We also have some other very exciting new products. In April, we introduced the new Agilent 6546 LC/MS Q-TOF system. This system is tailored to environmental, metabolomics research in food testing laboratories, providing ability to acquire high-resolution data across an unprecedented dynamic range. Customers can simply see more compounds and analyze them more correctly with this new offering. In addition during the quarter, we also introduced a unified purpose-built portfolio of SONOS products, targeting cancer immunotherapy with the addition of ACEA Biosciences. This offering enables research in this fast-growing segment. Our SONOS business continues to deliver double digit growth. While we\\'re facing soft market demand in our LSAG business, we remain confident in the strength of our portfolio and believe we are well positioned to continue wining in the market. Now, I would like to share more detail about the other two businesses. The Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver excellent results, growing 9% on a core basis. Demand is broad-based across all regions. This reflects the market-leading value of our portfolio and differentiated customer experience. In China, the ACG business grew in the mid-teens. The team continues to execute our strategy of leveraging Agilent\\'s large instrument installed base. We also continue to expand our services footprint in emerging cities, and tailor our consumer\\'s portfolio to local markets. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered a solid quarter with 6% core revenue growth. Regional demand is led by strength in the Americas. Our pathology related businesses grew high single-digits. Previously announced large competitive wins along with continued strong demand for our antibodies and our companion diagnostic services are driving our growth in that segment. Agilent also received expanded FDA approval for our PDL1 IHC companion diagnostic for metastic non-small cell lung cancer. This companion diagnostic would now be used to identify a broader range of patients who may qualify for first-line treatment with Keytruda. The NASD business continued delivering strong performance with mid-teens growth. We are on track to bring our second facility online. We anticipate the initial production of GMP grade APIs by the end of fiscal 2019. Material revenue contributions are expected in fiscal year 2020. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we\\'re confident that the momentum will continue in ACG and DGG businesses. For our LSAG business, our outlook for the second half is tempered by our view of continued soft market conditions. As a result, we have revised our outlook for the full year, reaffirming our prior EPS commitment while lowering revenue growth. Bob will describe this in more detail but first, just a few summary comments. We now expect to deliver core growth for the year between 4% and 5%. While we\\'re facing market headwinds in our LSAG business, our full year earnings guidance remains intact. The Agilent team remains firmly committed to meeting our current guidance for earnings growth. Our guidance reflects confidence in the strength of the overall Agilent business model and our ability to drive solid earnings results. Thank you for being on the call today and look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand the call to Bob. Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then I\\'ll finish up with our updated guidance for Q3 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. And percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Mike mentioned, we delivered solid Q2 earnings despite slower than anticipated top-line growth, underscoring the strength of Agilent\\'s financial model and our ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion with core quarter revenue growth of 4%. Reported growth was 3% as currency negatively impacted growth by 320 basis points, slightly higher than expected. This was partially offset by M&A contributing 190 basis points of growth. As Mike spoke to the business group\\'s performance for the quarter, I will provide some additional details around our end markets and regional performance. Pharma, our largest end market, delivered 2% core growth. We continue to see strength in biopharma and aftermarket services and consumables, and in our NASD business. However, the slowing of the instrument replacement cycle for small molecule applications led to a softer than expected result. Chemical and energy core growth was a strong 6%, above expectations and driven by strong low-teens growth in services and consumables. All regions grew led by strength in the Americas. Environmental and forensics was up 7%. Strength in forensics is linked to the ongoing global opioid crisis, which is driving demand for expanded forensic laboratory capabilities, more samples and broader screening requirements. The environmental market grew mid single-digits, and continues to be driven by an ongoing expansion of testing and oversight in China. Now wrapping up our end market discussion, core revenue for both diagnostics and clinical and academia and government, both grew 5%, while food declined 3% due to the softness in the China market. Geographically, we saw growth in all regions, led by the Americas with 6% growth as conditions in the U.S. continue to be healthy. Europe, with 4% growth, performed better than anticipated, driven by pharma outsourcing trends and continued strong biopharma investments. China grew 3%. And while we had strong mid-teens growth in the ACG business, softer instrument sales in the food market and small molecule pharma led to lower than expected overall results. Now before I leave revenue, the core growth of our combined LSAG and ACG businesses, while below our expectations, was 4% in the quarter. And we believe compares favorably to the overall analytical lab market growth. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q2 gross margin was 56% and increased 70 basis points compared to the prior year. We continue to achieve good gross margin improvements through our productivity initiatives, and driving continued economies of scale in our ACG services business. Operating margin was 21.9%, up 60 basis points, mainly due to discipline cost management as shifting market conditions became increasingly apparent in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, the tax rate was down marginally and average diluted shares were $321 million. This led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 in the second quarter, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year and at the midpoint of our guidance. Now, before moving to Q3 guidance and full year guidance, I want to touch on a few additional financial metrics on cash flow and on the balance sheet. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $213 million. We deployed $102 million in the quarter, consisting of $52 million in dividends and $50 million in share purchases, representing roughly 635,000 shares. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in debt. And during the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit line of $1 billion, which remains undrawn. With our strong balance sheet position, we will be more active in the second half of the year deploying capital. Specifically, we intend to deploy $500 million for share repurchases with the majority of that to come in the third quarter. This underscores not only our balance sheet strength, but also our confidence in the future. In addition, we still have plenty of capacity for M&A and we have an active business development funnel. Although, we will continue to remain disciplined in our approach. Now, let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the fiscal year. As Mike indicated, we\\'re reducing our core revenue growth outlook for the year. While our expectations for ACG and DDG aren\\'t changing, our forecasts for the second half is tempered by softening market condition in certain segments on the instrument side of the business. The developments in China, coupled with continued uncertainty on trade is creating a more challenging macro environment. As a result, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to a range of $5.085 billion to $5.125 billion representing 3.5% to 4.3% reported growth. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 210 basis points, partially offset by M&A. And as a result, we\\'re now expecting core revenue growth in the range of roughly 4% to 5%. Now despite reducing revenue guidance, we feel confident in holding to our full year earnings per share guidance range of $3.03 to $3.07, representing growth excluding currency of roughly 10% to 11% and reported growth of 8.6 to 10%. As Mike mentioned, our EPS guidance reflects confidence in the strength of Agilent\\'s business and our ability to drive earnings through multiple levers. These include disciplined expense management and the use of our balance sheet. Based on deploying the additional $500 million toward share repurchase, we are updating our average diluted share count down to $319 million for the year. Now finally, turning to the third quarter, we\\'re expecting revenue in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion, representing reported growth of 1.8% to 3.5% and core growth of 2.7% to 4.1%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of 210 basis points, partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 120 basis points to 250 basis points growth. Third quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 a share, which is 6% to 9% reported growth versus a year ago. The share count for Q3 is expected to be $317 million. Let me conclude by saying we are pleased with the team\\'s ability to preserve earnings performance despite shifting market conditions. We are confident in the strength of Agilent\\'s business and our ability to navigate softness in certain markets. With that, before opening up for questions, I will turn it back to Mike for some closing comments. Thanks Bob. I just want to add a few closing words before we move into Q&A. Great companies do not just react to market conditions, they see market opportunity. At Agilent, we will continue to drive productivity and double down our efforts to be a more agile company. We have marginal levers to drive earnings, including disciplined expense management and use of our balance sheet. However, we are not going to expense to cut our way to grow. We will continue to bring innovative new products to market and aggressively compete for market share. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. So first question, trying to make sure I understand the issues in small molecule pharma. Is that an LC comment specifically, or more broadly customers you\\'re labeling as small molecule pharma? And can you comment on the trends between ethical pharma and in generics? So I will make a few comments and then, Jacob, feel free to jump on this. I think it\\'s primarily LC related, and it’s a situation we\\'re seeing actually globally. I called out specifically the government initiative in China. We also saw in our large pharma accounts in U.S. and Europe this delays in purchasing. In fact, I remember talking with our European field manager. We had an order that was supposed to close in January with big European pharma company it was pushed out, we thought it was going to close at the end of March and now this closed in May. And perhaps you can add your thoughts here as well, Jacob. No, you\\'re absolutely, Mike, that that is primarily the LC business. However, many of those pharma companies also have investment into some other areas and when they now see some chances in the generics, they might put back also in other areas. So LC is a prime focus, but it certainly also expands into mass spec. And I think just to close this off. Dan, I think the comments for China were specific to generics. I think globally, we saw both in ethical and generic drugs in small molecule side. And then, Mike, my follow up. Can you elaborate just further on the actions you\\'re taking to respond to the market softness? And I ask because the detrimental margins in LSAG were pretty high. So can you elaborate a bit on what you\\'re doing to react? Thank you. So as Bob mentioned in his call notes, we\\'re actually quite pleased by the action of the team to really rapidly adjust the cost structure in a phenomena developed probably over the last four to six weeks of the quarter. And the actions are just double downing on the agile Agilent programs that we had already in flight, but also really making sure that we looked at the expenses that weren\\'t directly related to growth and really able to call to action to pull back on things that really don\\'t drive growth, like internal travel, for example. So we pulled all the levers we could. But while maintaining intact our coverage model in the field, as well as our MPI programs. And Bob, I don\\'t know if you have anything to add? I would just add, Dan. While the LSAG business did show a decline year-over-year, I would remind you to look at the total company, which actually did improve margins for year-over-year and for the 17%. So we operate this as a full company its part of the One Agilent approach. And so we\\'re taking a number of initiatives. But as Mike said, we\\'re also doubling down on areas, such as the new products in the areas where we think we can drive. We did see pockets of strength in LSAG and Jacob and team are really focusing on those areas; areas such as cell analysis and chemical and energy, and some of the other areas as well. So it\\'s not just an expense, it is really ensuring that we\\'re focused on the areas that we have the fastest opportunities for growth. So I\\'m going to follow up on some of the pharma questions. When we did the CEO call back in early April, you did call out the China generic headwinds. We didn\\'t really hear about the pharma delays at that point. So obviously, it seems like it came up later in the quarter. And you mentioned it was several accounts. So can you maybe just talk on how widespread it is? And is this a transitory issue in your mind, or how you\\'re thinking about pharma for the remainder of the year? Thanks for the excellent question, Tycho. And I do recall our conversations. I think it was in early April. And I had just come back from China and we were first hearing about the four by seven initiatives in China. And to your question, I think that we saw it fairly broad based, this is outside of China. So I think China\\'s got some specific things happening relative to the government actions around for 4 plus 7, which I think are fairly publicized, but we saw that both our U.S. and European customers. And we just had a major account review and all of our major accounts were down year-over-year. And there\\'s just a level of caution relative to replacing investments in the small molecule side of businesses, The same companies, however, are investing quite heavily in the biopharma side. So it\\'s a sort of a tale of two cities from the standpoint of what\\'s really going well inside some of our larger accounts versus where there\\'s been a pause. And Bob, I know you\\'ve looked at this quite closely as well. I don’t know if you have anything else to add to that? No, I think you\\'re right, Mike. And Tycho, as we\\'re thinking about the guidance going forward in the second half of the year, we are looking at probably a more moderated growth for pharma going forward. But still not at the rate at that we saw in Q2 but probably in the mid single digit where we were expecting probably high single digits globally. So I think we\\'re taking a prudent approach there as we are thinking about the outlook for the year. I would say that we\\'re continuing to, as Mike said, grow our biopharma business. But we still have the proportion, a large proportion of our pharma business being in the small molecule side. I would just add, Tycho, one thing we have seen though is on the small molecule side, there still is very high demand for chemistries and services. And I think you\\'ve seen that reflected in the strong ACG results. And it was a little surprising to see food down, now that you\\'ve anniversaried it. Can you maybe just -- and I know it\\'s not recovering, but is it getting worse? This has surprised us well. It\\'s not getting any worse; it\\'s just not getting any better. And we had anticipated coming on the anniversary that the central government will start reinvesting at the previous level and the spends just are not there. Now we\\'re seeing in other parts of the end markets, so the spends and investments in environmental are quite strong. But they\\'ve not yet returned to the spending levels that we had seen prior in the food market. But again, I would say the same story here relative to the aftermarket flows. We are still seeing strong growth on the aftermarket flows in food; it\\'s just the instrument purchases aren’t there. So it\\'s not getting any worse but it\\'s not getting better as we had thought. And then one just last clarification on the cost side. Are you taking any additional tariff remediation efforts given round three, just curios? We continue to be focused on additional remediation to minimize that, the increase between the round three from the 10% up to the 25% is incorporated into our guidance. It was a -- I\\'ve talked about this before, it\\'s roughly about $750,000 to $1 million in the second half of the year, net of the efforts that we\\'re taking. Just some clarity around some of the slowing you saw beginning in April. In the last call you talked about January being slow. So maybe just talk us through the cadence of the quarter, particularly in China? Were February and March trending okay and then you\\'ve got the signs of four plus seven, and April really slowed, because again one of your peers who didn’t have April in their quarter had some real softness there, which obviously was in March. So maybe just talk us through month-by-month how things trended there? We really want to make sure it\\'s clear to the investment community what we saw during the quarter. So what I\\'d say is if we\\'ve been having this discussion at the end of February we\\'re feeling really good about the quarter. In fact, we got off to a very good start. And as we looked at our forecast for the remainder of the quarter, it looked pretty solid. But as we increasingly went through the month of March, we were expecting in the last seven to 10 days our normal push of orders to close this. And I\\'d say normal pushes across all the regions, because often we have lot of customers who have quarter end date. So typically, March is a pretty strong month for us. And when we closed the last week or so, the orders in March, it just wasn’t there. We just didn’t get normal month end surge. And then perhaps maybe some order didn’t get booked at the end of March, we didn’t see anything unusual in the beginning of the April. So I think it was that timeframe that we knew we\\'re in the midst of something that we hadn\\'t expected. I would say, again, I think it caught our teams by surprise. I had been in China at the latter part of March, and we just reviewed the forecast. And then we could see that they were caught unexpectedly by customer delays in China. We also saw the same thing in Europe and in the U.S. as well. Patrick, if I could just add one more thing. What I would tell you is and just to reinforce the confidence we have in regards to the second half outlook. April did come in relative to our expectations on orders, our recast orders on the LSAG front, obviously, too late for revenue. But that gives us confidence that we have a handle on where the market is right now. We came in relative to our forecast, yes. But again, we\\'re still saying that it\\'s going to be subdued the second half. I really wanted to -- it\\'s not a situation where we see a continuing worsening of the end market environment, but we\\'re also not seeing a dramatic improvement either. But we do believe we\\'ve gotten a level of predictability back in the business based on what we saw in April. And then maybe just one housekeeping item. Could you just help us frame how much of your business is small molecule? I know 30% is under that biopharma umbrella. But maybe just help us think about how much is specific to the… In fact, Bob and I were just talking about this right before the start of this call. And I think right now we characterize it as 80-20, which is about 80% is small molecule -- was about was about 85% two or three years ago. We think there will be a shift to more biopharma naturally in 2020, given just the continued strong growth we\\'re having with today\\'s portfolio. But back to my comments on NASD, once that additional revenue flows, you will see the benefits of our broader biopharma play that Agilent has. But right now, I\\'d characterize it at about 20% of our -- 20% or 30% is in biopharma. I guess just going back to China. I mean how much did you debate what to do with the assumption there, even though April came in seems like, or at least overall for the book in line. Obviously, the last couple days have been quite a lot just in terms of some of the trade tensions and the uncertainty. It\\'s possible some of the four plus seven pieces get worse just in terms of China\\'s restrictions. I guess, how confident are you that you titrated this correctly, not just for what you saw in April but the current macro relative to the last week or so where obviously we had a pretty disappointing outcome on trade? Ross, great question, I almost feel like you may have been inside the hall here at the Agilent offices. So this was a big point of discussion with the team. And where we landed was our team had brought down their forecast in China relative to where we were before. And what we said is we\\'re going to take a very conservative view. We\\'re going to assume that the strain on the overall pharma market continues in China, as well as food there is no recovery. So basically, we\\'re assuming that the softness that we had experienced already through much of to the back half of the quarter will continue in the second half. So I think we\\'ve tried to be prudent relative to taking a very conservative and bringing our forecast down. And as you know, we had a high single digit forecast for the full year for China, but I think we\\'re probably at about 3% for the whole year. Again, I would remind the group too that lot of the call is focused on LSAG, which has really been the center of our weakness for the quarter on the top line. But one of the reasons why we have confidence in the overall growth forecast for China is that we have very predictable results coming through on the ACG side, which is mid-teens growth. And I think it\\'s been fairly well-publicized that we\\'re underpenetrated on DDG So we have expectations of good solid growth in both of those businesses. So it feels like tail of two cities, we expected the continued strength on the ACG and DDG side in China, while bringing down our expectations on the LSAG side. And Bob, I know we have lot of debate on this one. So maybe you have something else you\\'d like to add there.  Ross, maybe to put some dimensions to that when we think about how we\\'ve taken our guidance down for the second half of the year, really about two thirds to 70% of that reduction is really reflective of China and the other third $10 million to $15 million is probably the broader pharma. So the majority of it is the lower expectation or tempered expectations in the China market. And maybe ACG margins were pretty impressive. The pull-through there continues to be north of 50%. I guess what\\'s driving the massive step up in that business this year? Because the expansion even relative to what you saw in the first quarter accelerated, and so trying to get a feel for the underlying. So Ross, I\\'m glad you noticed that, because we really were quite pleased with the overall margin performance in ACG. And I think I made the comment inside the company and said, listen we\\'ve proven that we can scale our service business and make good margins. What I would like to do is maybe turn the call over to Mark Doak to let him take a little bit of a bow here with the audience and maybe share, Mark, what specifically has been going on within your team? Thanks Mike. And on the margins front, obviously, we have seen a nice expansion through the first half along that. I\\'d just add to a couple of things I think Mike and Bob has alluded to. First of all, on the agile Agilent programs, many of these are shared services across the company, which certainly help the broader gross margins for the business. But inside of the business, particularly services, there has been two major themes. One is we\\'ve used advanced analytics to really look at how we can improve various aspects of our operations and using the analytics pretty widely over the course of the last year to help drive that. And now the second component of that, I have talked many times about our drive to put our business online and use things like mobile apps that fundamentally facilitate faster and more complete work flows for team on the ground. So you can put all those pieces together, it\\'s turned up to be actually a quite positive development but this is after a lot of years of investment to really build a platform across our services business that’s scalable. I’m going to have a couple more questions on pharma in a second, but I actually want to start on DDG. If pathology grew high single digits and NASD grew mid-teens, it would seem hard for DDG to only grow 5.3% core given those businesses account for about 60% of DGG sales, unless you have some weakness in genomics. How did genomics go in the quarter in the quarter? And how are competitive dynamics evolving in target enrichment? Or maybe I\\'m just stop off course here and if so maybe, you can point me in the right direction? I don\\'t know the exact math at about 6% overall for the DGG. But I think the answer would be genomics business came in exactly as we had forecasted overall. Clearly, there\\'s some competitive wins out there on the target enrichment side. But the main challenge that we\\'ve seen have been more on our legacy genomics. And Sam, anything you might want to comment on there? Mike, you said it right. There are puts and takes in any business. I mean, overall we performed as we expected. We had some -- we\\'re continuing to see some really good strength related to our QC part of the portfolio. And so really nothing more to add it\\'s… And the reason why I mentioned, recall our non-NGS part of genomics -- on NGS side, which is inclusive of target enrichment, which was close to double digits. So it\\'s been more of some of the older products… So on LSAG, it looks to us like LSAG would have to decline to get to the midpoint of fiscal Q3 guidance. We get to the high end with it actually flat year-over-year. And that\\'s not changing our DGG or ACG assumptions, which we don\\'t think we\\'re being too aggressive there and basically being consistent with what you guys have been talking about all year. So are you assuming LASG core growth declines in the third quarter? And if so, how do we reconcile that with your comment on instrument orders improving in April? Does that tell us something about May order trends, or is this just conservatism coming off of a weaker than expected quarter? As we think about the various pieces, obviously, there\\'s some variation there. But we\\'re assuming roughly flat for LSAG in Q3. Hopefully, that proves to be conservative. But given that we saw this late in the quarter, I think we\\'re taking a prudent approach for Q3. As Mike said, our April orders hit our revised forecast but that\\'s also one month. So, hopefully, it proves to be conservative but I think it\\'s the appropriate level of forecast right now. And I think, Bob, the way that Doug\\'s thinking about the modeling of ACG and DGG, that\\'s just how we\\'ve been thinking about as well. That’s right. We expect them -- they continue to perform as expected, and we would have continue to see the growth rates that they\\'ve experienced in the first half be similar in second half of the year. And last one, the slowdown in small molecule demand is something you\\'ve been talking about for a while. And clearly things were and are worse than you expected. So I think all of that\\'s clear. But I want to make sure on the large molecule side that growth met your expectations? So that\\'s, like I said earlier, it\\'s a tail of two cities. The biopharma continues to do quite well, both in the instrumentation side but also we\\'ve been investing very heavily on the chemistry side, inclusive of one of our recent acquisitions. ProZyme was really targeted in the in the biopharma side. And then also we have the NASD story as well. So the biopharma is right where we thought it would be. Doug, I would say the other thing is and that we\\'re talking a lot about pharma and certainly it didn\\'t meet our expectations. I would say the biggest variable in the quarter though was because we were expecting the anniversary of the reorganization and to have a much better performance and it was still down. So following up on the two question, just looking and this is -- obviously, your waters has issue as well. I mean, is it some business just go to Shimadzu, or some business go to Dionex or some of the other companies that are out there. I mean can you just talk about that’s it\\'s not just business shifting around rather than things not coming back? In fact, I think it was almost a year ago in my Q2 \\'18 call that we first started talking about the organization of the whole foods, safety and structure in China. And we\\'re really confident the business isn’t going anywhere else, it\\'s just not there. And when I talk about the business, think about it along two dynamics; one, which is the business that’s been shifted to contract testing labs, which we\\'re well positioned. What we\\'re focusing on the central agencies where Agilent has historically had a strong position. They were just not investing right now beyond supporting their ongoing operations with the chemistries and services. So we\\'re confident that the business isn’t going anywhere else, it\\'s just not there. And did you -- I mean, I think we\\'re all surprised by the strength in the first fiscal quarter. I men, did you -- is some of the weakness just potentially as you saw the recent stockpiling you didn\\'t see happening in Q1 that… No, in fact I think as I said earlier, we were sitting here at the end of February thinking that this quarter wasn’t developed just as it was. And what we didn’t anticipate was just how quickly the pharma business slowed down in China and then as well as the lack of recovery on the food side. And then there seem to be this whole small molecule side in U.S. and Europe. So really, it was a tail of the latter part of the quarter. We saw nothing unusual about our -- we can\\'t point anything usual relative to our Q1 results. And the U.S. and European pharma slowdown. Was this just capital not being -- I mean, I know there is always a little bit of slowness when we release the capital fund at the beginning of the year. Is it that? Or just people -- I mean, you mentioned some order delays. And I guess is because that the company is just nervous on their small molecule businesses? I mean, are they -- once again you\\'ve certainly been asked the question that they\\'ve asked to extending the life on their current instruments, or going along those lines just trying to figure out what\\'s driving that? I think it\\'s a little of both, Derek. I do think that there -- we haven\\'t seen -- we obviously have a backlog, but we haven\\'t seen orders being canceled, or people saying they are not purchasing. It\\'s actually being delayed. And so the question for us was, is it transitory and we\\'ll catch up, we are taking the approach that is probably not going to catch up and it\\'s just going to continue to push. But I also do think that there is probably some element of trying to get more mileage, so to speak, out of your existing instrumentation, particularly as they are looking at capacity. Bob, I think it\\'s very clear out there that we see that there\\'s certainly a conservative procurement tactics happening right now, and people are stalling a little bit. But at the same time, we have to see that our fund is quite rich. So we still see a lot of business, but it goes much slower these days. So we actually do believe that it\\'s a great opportunity out there, but we can\\'t call it right now. Mike, I\\'d like to step back a little bit, I\\'ve realized it\\'s early. But could you speak to -- as we look at fiscal \\'20? Could you speak to the relevancy of the 4.5% to 6% mid-term range that you talked about at the June Analyst Day last year relative to the 4% to 4.5% you\\'re going to put up this year? And what specifically needs to get better to achieve that? I think it\\'s probably a little early to talk about 2020. But there\\'s really isn’t anything developing that we can see that takes away from our long term view of still to grow this company. And we\\'ve got -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, we have two or three businesses, are performing very well. And we have some incremental stuff that’s going to be coming in those businesses in 2020. And then I think what we need to see is really focused on the soft points that we saw in the LSAG business, which is a return to positive growth, a higher level of growth in China, which I called out of my remarks and listen, the quarter obviously not developed as we had forecasted. But we believe that as things -- eventually things will get settled down, issues will get resolved and we\\'ll get clarity on even in generics, which are currently under lot of pressure. When that industry gets through that knot and the survivors are going to be in a reinvestment mode and who need to drive productivity, we think there\\'s going to be business there. So I think that part of the story for 2020 is it would turn to an improved China market environment takeover. Jacob, I think you\\'d like to jump in on this as well?  Yes, I think overall we over the past few quarters, we have also delivered some very nice NPIs new products introduction here in the market, and we still have a very strong funnel. So as Mike is saying, when the market is coming back, we are absolutely in very strong position to take our share of the market. In addition too, as Bob noted in his call, the chemical energy business, which I had positioned earlier on is the wild card for Agilent. On the upside, we actually had really, really solid growth in Q2. And we\\'re pretty optimistic about that for the rest of the year. And then secondly would love to get an update on how some of the more recent acquired assets are performing relative to your deal models, like a CN and AATI. Looks like the M&A contribution expected for the year came down a bit. So would love to get an update on how some of those assets are performing? Thanks. Overall, I think that they continue to do -- is early but in fact we just had to review on this yesterday afternoon, I mean it delivered strong double digit growth ahead of expectations. So while that is not yet in revenue so it\\'s tracking very nicely. AATI was still very pleased with the performance to-date. The growth rates are probably a little bit slower, tied to if you look at the number of new instrument placements that Alumina had in the first quarter. So to some extent that business growth rate is tied to the growth rate of the NovoCyte and some other parts of the portfolio in Alumina. We\\'re expecting I think, Sam, in the back half is probably looking a little bit better for that as Alumina gets one of those instruments placed. And I think we also got a fair number tied to PacBio, so that gets resolved. But you\\'re close to the numbers but overall, there\\'s still double digit growth out of the companies we acquired. And I\\'ve pointed to the cell analysis business overall has been a double digit grower for us in the quarter. I wanted to follow up and was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit more, contrasting some of the weakness on the capital side versus the strength you\\'re seeing in ACG. I guess, just what’s embedded in the outlook for CrossLab through the end of the year? And just the level of comfort that some of the slower replacement cycle in the instrument side that the recurring piece can hold up as you look out over the next year? Yes, we\\'re really confident about the outlook on the ECG business. And often we find that if you have a slowing capital replacement that actually is an upside to the services, in particular where they\\'ll often be extending the life of equipment. So, Bob, I think we\\'re pretty -- this is an area of high confidence for us. And Jack, we\\'re expecting the continued performance into the second half of the year like we have in the first half. And quite honestly, the way we had in \\'18 as well, which is high single digit growth there, really behind both services as well as the consumables. We aren’t seeing testing volumes decline, whether that\\'d be in pharma or any of the other end markets that are actually quite strong. And so we feel pretty good about that. Our forecast remains unchanged there. And then just wanted to follow up on some of the comments related to the NASD business, obviously growth came in a little better again in the quarter than we\\'re expecting. But just the pacing of when the new line is going to open up and just that fourth quarter step up you\\'re expecting, just to confirm that. In fact, we decide a review very timely call. So, we’re expecting most likely the fourth quarter is where we start to see some initial revenue coming out of the new site. We\\'re still in the final phases of validation. So we don’t want to say we\\'re done yet, but we\\'re getting close. And we have our first customer lined up to for those initial batches out of our Frederick site. And we\\'re planning and opening in mid June, but that’s just a ceremonial opening. We won\\'t be yet producing a product that we\\'re forecasting inside the company in the fourth quarter of this year. And so that’s some initial revenue then with the largest step up coming in 2020. I\\'d also just complement Sam and his team, because we continue to find ways to get more revenue out of our existing voter site. So I would also tell you that our full year revenue projections on NASD are well intact. And Jack, just to maybe build-on that. I wouldn’t build any incremental revenue in Q4 for your model, because as we ramp up the facility, it\\'s really going to be a material contribution in 2020. So maybe my first question is just wanted to clarify on USP regulation. I know USP has been helping you in the past in terms of ICP-MS. Was there a step down in that application as well across the pharma channel worldwide or was it just weak in China? And what\\'s your outlook in that business aligned with ICP-MS? I mean, I’m asking this because it\\'s levered to small molecules and your customers are using it for analyzing the small molecule coatings. I\\'ll make a few summary comments, and then I\\'ll have Jacob jump in on this. But I believe we think that was actually been declining in the pharma space. But overall, we expect really good growth in our spectroscopy business as we look out with some of the other applications given the stronger PMIs in U.S. and demand for product and other end markets outside of the USP. But, Jacob, why don\\'t -- you\\'re closer to than I am? Yes, you\\'re absolutely right that we still have very nice opportunity last year in USP, but now it\\'s moved on both to water analysis but also the STM business. And generally speaking, we see that the ICP-MS growth, particularly in U.S. is very strong this year. So we actually see that data, plenty of opportunity with ICP-MS. Obviously, when new regulations come in place, then there is a certain opportunity but it looks like we jumped in for opportunity in that space. And I think it will continue to grow. And my second question is around -- I appreciate that you\\'re getting challenging quarter in LSAG here. But just help us understand the -- I mean, you talked about the magnitude of benefit that you received in 8890 and 8860. I don\\'t know if you quantified that in the quarter. And I\\'m asking that because in last call you’ve mentioned you started shipping that instrument, I think, in the second week of February. And just wanted to get a sense of how that instrument is contributing and what\\'s your expectation for the rest of the year? Puneet, thanks so much for asking about this, because this is a real bright spot in the overall LSAG performance in Q2, and it speaks to our view of the future. We didn\\'t quantified and probably won\\'t quantify the exact contribution but we did start shipping. But I\\'d say right now we have more orders in backlog than we shipped. And I think we\\'re 150%, 200% of our forecast. I mean it\\'s pretty significant. It has been very significant. Obviously, it is also some customers decided to move from the 78 into the 88 faster than we anticipated. But at the same time, we\\'re also seeing that that with the 8860 going for the mid range that that combination with the mass spec has actually been quite successful also. So overall, we see good momentum but we haven\\'t quantified the incremental. And just last one if I could squeeze in around food again, just wanted to understand. Again, is that business largely all LC there, or how much is the comp -- I mean, how do you look at that business in terms of the types of customers that are actually there, and how do you expect this improvement? Thank you. So when we think about the food safety marketplace, in particular, which is where we\\'ve been focusing on comments relatively China. It really is primarily a mass spec place. You\\'re talking about GC/MS, LC/MS, ICP-MS and some standalone LCs. And I think this is one of the reasons why we\\'ve done so well in this place historically is just the breadth of the portfolio we have across all those technology platforms. So it is broader than -- for Agilent, it\\'s broader than LC. Just going to your guidance commentary, two thirds of the reductions from China. How much of that is four plus seven versus food? I would say of that, roughly two thirds of it is food and about a third of it is four plus seven. Overall, when we think about China, the small molecule business in China is roughly 2% to 3% of the overall Agilent revenue just to frame in the size. And then on the four plus seven program, what\\'s the incremental risk if that moves beyond the initial 11 pilot cities? And how long do you think it takes the market to work through these changes? I actually think the way we\\'re thinking about that, Catherine, is actually because while it\\'s only in 11 cities, I think it\\'s created a pause throughout the provinces to understand what the impact is. So it\\'s actually got greater. We think we\\'re seeing that impact now as opposed to further impact down the road. I think actually what you\\'ll see it\\'s once this determined, it will actually create clarity about what\\'s going to happen throughout the course. And we think we\\'ve seen the impact broader than just those 11 cities. And then just last one, we saw your SPMI drop below 53 in April, and your spends below 50 for a couple of months now. It sounds like you\\'re pretty optimistic on chemical energy outlook. So maybe talk about what you\\'re expecting in the back half for chemical energy and the puts and takes there? Our chemical and energy business in the back half is, we\\'ve talked about when we gave initial guidance at the beginning of the year low single-digit, and that’s what we\\'re thinking about. We\\'re positively surprised in Q2. For reference, Q1 was roughly 2% grew to 6% in Q2. We\\'re assuming low single digits in the back half of the year consistent with our early guide. And for Europe as well across the businesses we\\'re thinking low single digits, again consistent with our estimates at the beginning of the year. We\\'re positively surprised in Q2 but we\\'re expecting it to be consistent with what our initial expectations were. Two things for you, Mike. I guess, first, as it relates to the China food business. Have you thought it all -- is it possible that the softness continues for quite a while here even though we\\'ve started anniversary it as that volume moved to these more efficient commercial labs versus the previous government run lab? And then I just have one quick follow up. What\\'s happened also the charter of what these organizations do has changed. So a lot of the volume activities has been to the contract special labs and these guys are all now developing methods and the new reg. So we think they are going to require ultimately the next generation technologies equivalent to stay on leading the edge of research and development of new applications. If that being said, we\\'re not assuming any recovery in the second half of this year. So we\\'ve become much more cautious about the outlook for food in the second half. I think that’s fair… Yes, I mean, to be honest, we\\'ve assumed recovery and it\\'s taken a little longer than we expected. So we\\'re going to temper our growth until we\\'re wrong to the upside. And then, Bob just one quick follow up for you. And I know you\\'re not going to provide any 2020 guidance. But just give us some perspective on the new Frederick NASD site. It sounds like minimal revenue here in fiscal \\'19. Where do we get in fiscal \\'20 as it relates to the $100 million revenue potential capacity? Steve, you\\'re correct. We\\'re not going to give a forward looking. What I would say though is we\\'re generally on track with what we said back in June of last year in terms of the ramp up and so forth. So how that ramps across the quarters and across the year is still -- we haven\\'t gone through our planning cycle. But what I will tell you is that we feel very good, we have a very robust funnel for products that are going into that site. We\\'ve already had some customers toward the site. Obviously, it\\'s not operational yet, because we\\'re still doing the validation, as Mike talked about. But it\\'s moving along as we expected. I wanted to ask a question maybe back to, Jacob. I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color about what you\\'re hearing from customers on the pharma side in U.S. and Europe to account for the more restrictive budgets and if it\\'s related to anything with global macro, maybe for Mike. Have you seen any such impact to other businesses as well? Actually, what don’t I start off, Dan. And thanks for the question. And then I\\'ll pass it down to -- over to Jacob for specifics on pharma. We haven\\'t seen that in the other segments of the marketplace. And there\\'s a lot of noise out there, so uncertainty is never good. But we really can\\'t point to anything specific. And I think if you look at our results, I mean, you saw two, three businesses continue to perform as expected and do quite well. And then we had some isolated but obviously impactful slowdowns in aspects of the LSAG business, albeit the chemical energy, academic government, environmental forensics, and biopharma, were continued sources of strength. So I think it\\'s really been isolated to the factors you mentioned. And I know, Jacob, you\\'ve been trying to do a little bit more diligence around this. And we have some theories but I\\'m not sure we have 100% specific answer of what\\'s driving the customers and delay the purchases on the small molecule side. No, clearly, we are seeing that conservative procurement tactics that they are they using. And obviously, we\\'ve been out doing our own digging to understand what is really going on there. And first of all, we don\\'t see any change in competitive dynamics. This is not -- this is truly a market situation we\\'re in right now. So this is where it\\'s -- people are the procurement organizations and customers and they only are just more cautious in their decision on capital equipment expenditure right now. So I think just more speculation on our part, but we -- some of the things where, hey, there\\'s still some question about where prices are in land in certain parts of the world in terms of unused prices, some questions about growth. And then again, as we mentioned earlier in the call, prioritization that when push comes to shove, privatization of biopharma over small molecule. Again, we just think it\\'s a push out delay business has not been canceled. And then the related to a question, I know that was asked earlier, just want your clarification. So I think you gave us what pharma has baked in for Q3. Can you just let us know what assume pharma and food for Q3 and Q4 and just remind us, how big is your China food business? So on the on the guidance -- Dan, this is Bob. We\\'re assuming, as I mentioned before, for pharma mid single digit growth for the full year, and that\\'s consistent with where we are for Q3 as well on a global basis. So better than the 2% that we had in Q2. In food, we’re expecting for Q3 probably a slight decline as well. As I mentioned, hopefully that proves to be conservative but we\\'re assuming that overall for the full-year, food will be flat to slightly down. And I think historically, Bob, it\\'s run about 15% to 18% of our China business has been in food. Obviously, with the decline is probably close to that 15% number. And then if I can ask one more since that seems to be the trend here, just on the cap deployment, obviously, more towards the buyback in Q3. But how are you thinking about M&A? Obviously, you have a lot of balance sheet optionality. Just wondering what the pipeline looks at and how we think about over the next say six to 12 months? Thanks. In fact, the pipeline looks very robust. And as I signaled I believe in the last call, we\\'re very active right now and don’t have anything announce, but we want to deploy the capital. We want to leverage the strength on the balance sheet. Bob is very explicit to how we\\'re going to use one aspect of that relative to the buy back side, but we have plenty of firepower to execute on targets. And as you can see based on my earlier comments and some of the numbers we’re putting up with the companies we have acquired, we\\'re increasingly confident in our ability to deliver on SOVs, if you will, for our shareholders when we deploy that capital. And that concludes today\\'s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dhingra for closing remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. And now I\\'d like to introduce you to the host for today\\'s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s third quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent\\'s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob\\'s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of Agilent\\'s CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of July 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations. The Agilent team delivered total revenues of $1.27 billion, up 6% on a core basis. Our EPS of $0.76 is up 13%. Both our top line revenue and EPS are above the high end of our guidance range. This marks our 18th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. In July, we also announced the pending acquisition of BioTek, which would be our largest acquisition since the 2015 launch of the new Agilent. We continue to invest for growth even amid market uncertainty. At the same time, our Agile Agilent business system continues to drive operational improvements. Our excellent overall company growth is being driven by two factors. First, strength in the global pharma market in both small molecule and biopharma. Secondly, geographic strength in the U.S. across most end market segments. China growth was generally in line with expectations. Business unit performance is led by double-digit growth in our Agilent CrossLab and Diagnostic and Genomics Group. Let\\'s take a closer look at the performance of all 3 of our business groups. I will start with ACG, our Agilent CrossLab Group. The ACG business continues its trajectory of consistently strong results with 11% core growth. This growth was broad based across all market segments and regions. Our service business grew at a double-digit rate as we continue to see higher demand for our expanding portfolio, both from current and new customers. We see a continued secular trend of customers seeking to drive increased productivity and to outsource non-core services in the lab. Our services offering puts us in a leadership position to benefit from that trend. Our consumables business also grew double-digit. We continue to introduce highly differentiated consumables and address important customer challenges and a significantly improved user experience, especially in high-growth markets like biopharma. I\\'m very pleased with the continuing positive impact on total company results from the Agilent\\'s CrossLab strategy. Our consistent results speak to the strong execution from the Agilent team and the value we bring to our customers. We\\'re meeting the ever-increasing demand from our customers, and we see the attach rates to our installed base of instruments consistently improving. Now turning to DGG, our Diagnostics and Genomics Group business. DGG\\'s growth momentum continues with strong 13% core growth. The growth is broad based across pathology, genomics, and our NASD businesses. Let me share a few additional comments on our NASD business. NASD turned in a very strong third quarter as we continued to see increasing demand from our customers\\' clinical trials. As a reminder, in June, we opened our second production facility located in Frederick, Colorado. We remain on track to start commercial shipments this quarter. We also announced that we purchased our previously leased site in Boulder, Colorado. These 2 facilities enable Agilent to meet the growing demand for development of RNA-based therapeutics and continue to be a partner of choice to both pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  Now moving on to our LSAG, our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group business. LSAG\\'s revenue is flat year-over-year on a core basis and in line with our expectations. Strength in the pharma, environmental, and forensics markets was offset by chemical energy declining against a very tough 12% compare and expected weakness in the China food market. As you know, in Q2, we discussed 3 areas that impacted LSAG\\'s growth rates. Let me give you an update.  First, starting with the 4+7 initiative in China. We saw a sequential improvement in demand from generics manufacturers. This is driven by business coming from the winners of the first 4+7 pilot, resulting in growth in our instruments business. We have deep relationships and history with these customers. While the program is expected to expand over the rest of the calendar year, we see incremental regulatory clarity ultimately drive increased production volumes in a favorable long-term investment environment. Second, the China food market conditions remain the same as last quarter and in line with our expectations, with revenues flat to Q2. The business from government-owned labs remains muted, while commercial testing labs activity is increasing. We are expecting similar overall market conditions this coming quarter as well.  Finally, the global small molecule pharma business outside of China saw improvement in demand relative to Q2. We saw budgets free up and LC replacements taking place in some of our large accounts as well as the addition of new customers. While macroeconomic and political conditions are creating market uncertainty for capital investments, I am quite confident in our ability to take market share in whatever market environment we encounter. We have an industry-leading portfolio and are not sitting still. We continue to invest in new offerings and markets. One of these new market investments is the pending acquisition of BioTek. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire BioTek, a global leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of innovative cell analysis instrumentation. I\\'m very excited by the significant step forward in strengthening our leadership position in the fast-growing cell analysis space. Our strategic focuses there began with the purchase of Seahorse Bioscience in 2015 and was followed by the acquisitions of Luxcel Biosciences and ACEA Biosciences in 2018. By combining BioTek\\'s offering with Agilent, we will create a business with revenues greater than $250 million per year, up from zero four years ago, this business is growing double digits today. Looking ahead, we will now be able to deliver a breadth of differentiated workflows, enabling customers to obtain deeper, more reliable insights across a variety of cell analysis applications. This is yet another example of how we\\'re investing in new, high-growth markets where we can leverage core Agilent capabilities in our One Agilent culture. The culture and portfolio fit with BioTek are extremely well aligned. We share the same core values and have very similar cultures with a genuine focus on our customers and teams. I look forward to welcoming the BioTek team into the Agilent family. We expect the acquisition to close later this fiscal quarter. We also continue to bring new and innovative offerings to the market across all of our businesses. These new offerings are consistently drawing very strong interest from both new and existing customers. For example, earlier this year, we launched major updates to our gas chromatography, spectroscopy, and genomics portfolio.  In addition, in Q3, we had an excellent showing at the ASMS Conference highlighted by the launch of a new Agilent Infinity Lab LC/MSD iQ system. This new system incorporates designed-in smart features, software, and hardware, developed specifically for chemists and chromatographers. Our new LC/MSD iQ system is a single-quad mass spec, built on the revolutionary Ultivo LC Triple Quad core technology platform. We also launched a brand-new Agilent 6546 LC/Q-TOF system that provides analyst ability to simultaneously acquire high-resolute data across unprecedented dynamic range. In addition, during the quarter, we introduced a new Agilent 6495 C Triple Quad LC/MS system that provides industry-leading precision in complex major Cs. And finally, we introduced a new Agilent Bravo sample prep system for metabolic analysis of human plasma samples. This new offering further strengthens our leading position in metabolomics. We also brought to market the first outcome of our joint development work with a newly combined Agilent and ACEA teams. At the CYTO 2019 conference, we introduced the NovoCyte Advanteon flow cytometer. This new offering addresses today\\'s high end and increasingly sophisticated multi-color flow cytometry assays. It provides unsurpassed sensitivity, resolution, detection speed, and the flexibility of resin channel. In addition, the number of indications from our PD-L1 diagnostic assay continue to expand. In Q3, we received FDA approval for 2 new indications. Our PD-L1 diagnostic may now be used as an aid in identifying patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA in a total of 6 cancer types. While making all these investments and launching new products, we continued our trajectory of margin expansion by 90 basis points versus last year. Our Agile Agilent system of continuous process improvement and disciplined cost management keeps the team focused on finding and executing on new opportunities. A few closing comments on our Q3 results and company transformation that has been underway for several years. Looking ahead, we continue to see uncertainty in a challenging market environment in some end markets for capital instrument purchases. This quarter\\'s results again demonstrate Agilent\\'s ongoing transformation towards higher growth markets in an increasingly resilient business model with a higher mix of recurring revenue streams. Given our Q3 results and outlook, we\\'re raising our full year guidance for earnings as well as revenue growth at the midpoint of guidance, and Bob will describe this in more detail.  Before I turn it over to Bob, I\\'d like to leave you with a few -- a couple of thoughts here. At the close of our Q2 call, I commented that great companies do not just react to market conditions, they see market opportunity. At Agilent, we will continue to invest for growth and take market share in whatever market conditions we encounter. We\\'re continuing to drive productivity and we\\'re doubling down our efforts to be a more agile company. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to invest in the business and return capital to our shareholders. I\\'m quite confident that our company has never been stronger and that we\\'re well positioned to drive continued growth and earnings expansion in an increasingly uncertain global economy.  Thanks for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions. I\\'ll now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\\'ll provide some additional detail in revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and to discuss our capital deployment during the quarter. I\\'ll then finish up with our updated guidance for Q4 and full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike said, our third quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across a number of fronts. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, with core revenue growth of 6.2%. Reported growth was 5.8%, with currency negatively impacting revenue by 1.9 points and acquisitions adding 1.5 points to growth.  In terms of end markets, pharma, diagnostics and clinical, and environmental and forensics, led the way for us in the third quarter. Pharma, our largest market, grew 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments, services and consumables as well as NASD, our biopharma business continues to grow at double-digit rates, and we saw good growth in the small molecule business as well, both in instruments and recurring revenues.  Our Environmental and forensics business grew 15% on a core basis in the third quarter, albeit on an easier compare. As with the second quarter, our forensic strength is tied to demand for expanded lab capabilities. This is a result of the ongoing global opioid crisis, which is driving increased sample testing and broader screening requirements. Our environmental business grew high single digits. Again, driven by the ongoing expansion of testing in China. Diagnostics and clinical, core revenue grew 7% during the quarter, driven by strength of our pathology and genomics businesses. Chemical and energy revenue grew 1% against a very tough compare of 12% growth from Q3 of last year. Results were driven by continued strength in services and consumables.  Academia and government declined 5%, largely due to order timing and rounding out the discussion of end markets, food revenue declined 3%, driven by China coming in as we expected, and as Mike discussed.  On a geographic basis, we again saw growth in all regions, led by the U.S., growing at double-digit rates, with strength across all 3 businesses. China grew 1%, generally in line with our expectations, primarily due to the weakness in food. If you exclude food, growth in China was 6%; Asia, outside of China, also grew at a double-digit rate, driven by growth in Japan and South Korea. Europe grew 3%, in line with our expectations as the market environment remains subdued. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, essentially flat year-over-year, with tariffs impacting gross margin adversely by 30 basis points. We\\'ve been able to mitigate the impact to tariffs through discipline and cost management, and the ongoing focus on efficiency. Our operating margin was 22.8%, up 90 basis points as revenue growth outpaced growth in operating expenses. Year-to-date, our margins continue to expand as our teams have executed strong expense discipline.  And as a result, non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.76, $0.03 higher than the top end of our guidance and representing 13% growth. In addition to our operating performance, we were very active in deploying capital during the quarter. In Q3, we returned $600 million to shareholders. We bought back shares worth $549 million, totaling 8 million shares, and paid $51 million in dividends. As Mike mentioned, we also signed a definitive agreement to acquire BioTek Instruments and expect the deal to close by the end of our current fiscal fourth quarter.  So year-to-date, including BioTek, we\\'ve committed to deploying over $2.2 billion in capital this year. Of that, $1.4 billion was spent in growth acquisitions with ACEA and BioTek, expanding our cell analysis franchise. We have also returned over $800 million through dividends and share buybacks. Our balance sheet today remains healthy and we continue to look for opportunities to add growth assets to our portfolio.  Now turning to the cash flow. We generated $242 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter in an effectively cash neutral position. Now let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the year -- fiscal year. As Mike mentioned, with the strong results in Q3 and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Please note that our guidance does not include any impact from the expected BioTek acquisition. For the full year revenue guidance, we\\'re increasing the lower end of our range. Thereby, increasing the midpoint, resulting in a new range of $5.105 billion to $5.125 billion, representing 3.9% to 4.3% reported growth. Currency is expected to be a headwind of roughly 200 basis points, partially offset by M&A contributing 150 basis points. As a result, we\\'re now expecting core revenue growth in the range of 4.4% to 4.8% for the full year. With the strong execution we\\'ve seen in terms of our business strategies, we\\'re raising our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.07 to $3.09. This represents growth of 10% to 10.8% for the year. And now turning to the fourth quarter. We\\'re expecting revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion, representing reported growth of 1.2% to 2.8% and core growth of 1.5% to 3%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of roughly 100 basis points partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 70 to 80 basis points of growth. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86 per share, which is 3.7% to 6.2% reported growth versus a year ago. Also of note, the newly announced tariffs on the additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China is not expected to be material for us. And the share count for Q4 is expected to be 313 million shares. Now before opening up the call for questions, I\\'d like to conclude by saying that Agilent\\'s resilient business model is built for the long term. We believe we are focused on the right strategies that will continue to serve us well and ensure solid shareholder value long into the future. Mike and team, can you talk a little bit more, obviously, the China number, the 4+7 tailwind -- hit, seemed to be a little less in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more? You mentioned spending. And I guess, it\\'s like how are you sort of thinking about spending patterns now that the second wave kicks in. Just a little bit more color in what you\\'re seeing there. And then, as a correlated question, there\\'s obviously a lot of changes going on in the drug manufacturing space right now with some consolidation going on. Obviously, some M&A into the ones that\\'s like -- how are you sort of thinking about some of the changes going on in terms of the bigger generic players, some of the consolidation in the space? And I guess, how are you positioned in those markets? Yes. Sure. Let me -- I\\'ll take the first one, and Jacob, he can pass the second one to you. So, first of all, as we talked in the last call, we had seen a pause in our second quarter as it related to the rollout of the 4+7 initiative. But at the time, we said, listen, we\\'ve actually did a good thing, a long term and eventually will lead to increased divestments once we start to sort out who the winners are. So -- and that actually is how the quarter developed for us where we actually saw the winners starting to invest. And we think that level investment relative to Wave 1 will continue through our fiscal year.  As it relates to the core of your question, which is how about Round 2? Our view is that they\\'re going through a process of doing the bidding and sorting out the winners over the latter part of this year, and the impact on the business is more an FY \\'20 kind of impact in terms of what we\\'re going to see in China. But again, I\\'d just point to -- we think these are good long-term developments for our business here because of the strength of our relationships and their real emphasis on productivity and compliance. And Jacob, your thoughts around the -- questions about the industry consolidations and generics? Yes. I think that\\'s a really relevant question. And clearly, with some of the winners coming out now in China, I think we will see some consolidation. I think Agilent will be in a very good position in this space, both in China and in general as we have very strong relationship with many of the larger end winners in the generic space. So, when this happens, which is part of the normal pharma cycle, we are ready to support them and make them successful. And Derik, I just meant to put a period of this one, which is whether the generic consolidations are happening in China or in other parts of the world, we think overall, the productivity message and real value we can deliver to this segment of market really, really resonates with them. I guess maybe just digging in a bit on DGG, Rob. I think the performance there was kind of notably strong, and so you called out a couple things, including an NASD [ph], which seems like it\\'s starting to ramp, but also a bit on opioids, and then on the sort of array side. But academic was weak. Just give us a little bit of a picture kind of the magnitude, maybe, of some of the outperformance in some of these pieces. And then, sort of how to think about that cadence maybe in the context of sort of the fourth quarter guide. Sure, Ross. I\\'ll make some initial comments here, then Sam, you can jump in and correct me if I\\'m off target here. But one of the messages that we were trying to convey in our earnings call, which is while the NASD growth was very strong in the quarter, that wasn\\'t the only bright spot in DGG. It really was across the board whether it be in our pathology business, and we think we\\'re putting up numbers that are growing faster than the market whether it be because of the increased acceptance for automation platform with the Omnis, the continued utilization and expansion of the PD-L1 assay on the genomics side. We saw good growth in our NGS related business, Sam. I think that was probably double-digit for us for the quarter... And then lead for the NASD strength, which we think is here to stay. Looking into the fourth quarter, we\\'re kind of thinking something like high-single digits, I think, for this business. And Sam, anything else you want to add there? Because the only message I want to get across was broad-based strength. Now I think, Mike, you really outlined where the business is. And pathology, it\\'s a business that\\'s built over time, right? It\\'s not just about a single quarter, but it is the combination of the assays that we have, the increasing number of indications, PD-L1 related that we announced 2 of them, approval from the FDA, but it\\'s also the ongoing growth in our installed base, be it of Omnis, be it of other platforms. And our Companion Diagnostic business, which a lot of it feeds into that, is also -- it\\'s performing in a really healthy way. The genomics business, also, as you said, it performed well, but that\\'s broad-based around the world. So, we\\'re pleased to see that both in terms of genomics-related instruments like the platforms that we have for TapeStation, Bioanalyzer, the AATI product category. So, we feel good about the performance in the coming quarter or two. And then, maybe, just on the C&E side, I mean, obviously, you called out a tough comp, but a lot of macro volatility in the last few weeks, a lot of things happening on the trade side. I guess, how are you trying to interpret sort of all the key leads in that subsegment as you\\'ve had some good underlying product cycle. But obviously, there\\'s some instability just broadly. And so, how do you feel like, aside from sort of competing well in whatever market there is about sort of what that actual end market environment is going to look like for the next quarter or 2? Yes. Great question, Ross. It\\'s something we\\'ve spent a lot of time here inside the company talking about. And kind of entering into this year, we had some concerns about the chemical energy market just in terms of -- there\\'s macro noise even coming into our physical year. So I think we got it, like kind of low singles coming into the year. But as you may recall, in our first guide, after we raised the guidance, hey, this could be a source of upside.  Well, clearly, that is not happening. So we\\'re still assuming kind of low single digits, but probably negative growth in instruments because even though the product cycles are really strong, I think we\\'re well positioned to win when money\\'s there. But we\\'re still going to assume for the -- at least the rest of this fiscal year that there will be growth in chemical energy. But overall, that will be driven by the strength of our ACG business, and we expect the demand to be pretty, pretty muted, if you will, in the C&E. And Bob, maybe you can take a quick look at this -- deep look at this, and maybe have some quick comments. Yes. I think that\\'s right, Mike. And Ross, thanks for the question. If you look at our Q4, I think we\\'re trying to be prudent in our forecast certainly with continued strength in our ACG and DGG businesses. But yes, LSAG or the capital business is continuing to have slow growth and capital in the C&E areas, one of those markets that we\\'re looking at. And certainly with PMIs, the way that they are and as you say, the uncertainty in the market certainly isn\\'t helping. And so we think we\\'ve tried to take that into account for our fourth quarter.  The new products that Mike mentioned didn\\'t have a material impact on the quarter. But the ones that we\\'ve launched, the gas chromatographs and so forth, continued to have very positive uptake. But it\\'s -- the market is slower, kind of as -- and it\\'s kind of playing out the way we expected at the very beginning of the year. I guess if there\\'s one silver lining in terms of -- which is the, again, back to this productivity message and the fact that we now have a fleet of really great new products and there\\'s a real productivity benefit to the customer, they\\'re in a stronger position to go to their management and get support for their investment because it does really help their P&L. Mike, can you talk a little bit about the global pharma picture? You said it delays last quarter. Now you\\'re saying kind of budget\\'s freed up. So how much of the 13% growth you saw was just kind of catch up from last quarter? And how you\\'re feeling about sustainability of that going forward? So I\\'ll let Bob do a little math on the catch-up. But let me make some macro comments while you\\'re doing your mental math. But as we pointed out in Q2, we said, hey, in Q2, biopharma really is quite strong. By the way, it was strong and even stronger this quarter. But we said, hey, we saw a pause in the small molecule side outside of China and we talked a lot already about the 4+7 but it really was kind of curious or something, what was going on with our large accounts in U.S. and Europe. And I think they were just being prudent in their budgeting process, and we saw a release of funds in the -- in our third quarter. And we\\'re expecting that to continue.  So we don\\'t see that as being a one-quarter phenomena, albeit that that\\'s why we try to use the words in some end markets we\\'re expecting some pretty challenging market conditions. So pharma, actually, we think is continuing to be a source of growth on the LSAG instrument side, while we expect some markets to actually be down year-over-year. And Bob, I don\\'t know how we can parse out the catch-up? Yes. I think, Tycho, the way I would talk about it is, as I mentioned, the pharma business grew 13% in the quarter. And if you look at small molecule, it was mid-single digits. So there was probably some catch-up, but I wouldn\\'t say it was material that, that mid single-digits is kind of where it has been historically over the last several quarters. So I think it -- what we have said and kind of the hypothesis has been that\\'s primarily a replacement cycle. They can hold off for a number of quarters but they can\\'t do that forever if they want to keep their manufacturing processes in place. And so we think we are in that. It wasn\\'t a snapback. So there wasn\\'t more in Q3 than what we saw. But I think it was now they\\'re getting further in the fiscal year and they\\'re actually spending that money. Yes. I think that\\'s correct. But we do see that the larger accounts are still very conservative in the procurement, while some smaller pharma actually is investing these days. So that\\'s where we actually see some of the growth coming from also. And we are taking good share there. Yes. Thanks for the build there because in my narrative, I talked about the business coming not only from existing customers, but new customers. And we\\'ve been very aggressive in that regards as well. Bob, I\\'m not sure we have much more insight. And that business tends to be lumpy for us, right? And... Yes. As you know, it\\'s a relatively -- it\\'s the smallest piece of our business and it goes up and down. And so we\\'re not going to call out any one particular order or orders across the business. But we feel good about our position there going forward. And we\\'re expecting that to return to growth in the fourth quarter. I will also say, back on the pharma business, when we look at our ability, I think one of the things that speaks well to our value proposition with our customers is when you look year-over-year, our pricing actually has held up pretty well. Our pricing is roughly -- it\\'s slightly above on the LSAG business. So I think that speaks to the value that we are able to bring from a productivity standpoint to customers. Hey, Bob, back on academia and government, maybe just to share a discussion we were having inside the company, which was we\\'re not a little bit concerned about this because we still see the funding environment. It\\'s actually being quite strong and stable. So it\\'s just a timing issue. So we don\\'t see anything happening materially different in the marketplace. Okay. If I could ask one last clarification before hopping off. On China, 4+7, do you expect the impact to be the same magnitude next year as it is this year, given that it\\'s different rules for Round 2? I wasn\\'t sure from your comments earlier if you... So Tycho, I\\'m going to resist the temptation to do an FY \\'20 guide. But I would say, directionally, it\\'s going to be an increase. Mike, just starting with the China food business. Can you just sort of give us an update on where you stand as far as building out some of your commercial teams to go after that private lab channel in China? Sort of your general visibility now today relative to maybe where you were three months ago. Yes. Happy to do so. So we\\'re fully built out. So we\\'ve been working this probably well over 1-year, 15 months. Because I think the first time I started talking about this was Q2 \\'18 call. So from a channel reach, channel perspective, we\\'re there both in terms of our direct reach, but also through some of our digital enablement of customers. So we feel really good about our channel reach and relationships with the commercial accounts. And we\\'re seeing it in the numbers. So we\\'re seeing really -- it\\'s really a tale of two cities. And Jacob, I\\'ll have you jumping on this one as well in a second, because I know you\\'ve been digging into this, but sort of tale of two cities. We\\'re getting good growth on the commercial. There\\'s just no real new investment happening on the government lab side of things. So... Yes. That\\'s true, Mike. And we do see double-digit growth on the contract labs these days, but coming from a smaller base. And while -- so we have our very large market share in the government account. So clearly, when the catch up is happening, I actually believe we will see a very strong growth in this business again. Yes. If there\\'s any silver lining, it would be as Q3 was as we expected. So we weren\\'t surprised by the number, albeit down. Yes. And as we\\'re thinking about Q4, we\\'re expecting Q4 to be -- kind of play out the way Q2 and Q3 did in terms of roughly flat at that $40-ish million revenue run rate. Right. Which, looking at our -- I think we clocked a 16% growth overall in China Q4 last year. So I would say up against a tough compare. And then, maybe one more for Mark Doak. The gross margins in the CrossLab business are pretty substantially year-over-year. I think the new high at 52%. Sort of speak to the drivers of that gross margin improvement and sort of what you see is the midterm runway, midterm opportunity for gross margins. Sure. I\\'ll be glad to. And if you pull us back, it\\'s several things contributing to it. Over time, mix has been a play in terms of our consumables business being from a margin perspective, north of the company average. But also, a lot of work we\\'re doing is relative to some of the Agile Agilent programs, but specifically looking at delivery efficiencies and our services team. We\\'ve been able to add a lot more revenue without a lot of proportional cost to that. And that comes to really what we\\'re seeing increasing as a big factor in our margin expansion is scale. And we\\'re in that position now where we can invest. Mike had talked about some of our digital capabilities, both in the channel, but also in the back office areas. And it starts to fuel these efficiencies. We can reinvest some of those profits to build even more strength in the area. So it\\'s really eating off itself as you will. And when you pull it all together, between portfolio mix, continued move towards scale, and driving efficiencies through these digital capabilities. So those probably the big drivers behind it. So first one on the cell analysis market. I mean with your recent acquisition of BioTek, and obviously, you\\'ve added Seahorse and ACEA before, do you think you have enough pieces here to sort of ultimately serve this growing and expected to be even further growing cell therapy developed in the market? And -- or do see more room for further capital deployment here? And I should say that this did increase your biologics exposure in some ways and it\\'s likely to increase that. So just wanted to get a sense of what you have currently, and should we expect more here? Yes. So let me start this off, and then, Jacob, feel free to chime in as well. So we think now at $250 million, we have a business with scale. And I think that\\'s really important to say. We think we really compete. And really, we are really bullish on this space. And I think our investments dreams started several years ago. So whilst we are still in the process of digesting what we\\'ve just recently acquired, and then we have to bring the Agilent -- into the Agilent family, the new BioTek team. So we think we have a lot of really good scale once we close with the BioTek acquisition. But that being said, I think we have further aspirations to continue to build-out in that space as well. Yes. And building on that, I think, first of all, we clearly have scale today. But what is very important here is that the strategy we started out some years ago, 4 years ago now, was not just to build scale in the cell analysis business, but build differentiated components that could build together into workflows that would really do differentiate -- really provide differentiating information for our customers. So not only have flow -- up against flow and some plate with [indiscernible] against paid, we will combine them together with a particularly important immuno-oncology space, and especially here in the CAR-T space. We\\'ve seen that already happening. So before actually the acquisition of BioTek, we used the Seahorse and the BioTek and collaborated between the two companies to provide a workflow that combine those two technologies together in the same software and the same micro type of plate, and we saw that, that actually grew the market opportunity significantly. So now combining the Seahorse, ACEA, the BioTek and Luxcel together, I think we have a really, really strong differentiated position, but it also allows us to add more workflows into that space going forward. But our main priority right now is to integrate and be successful with BioTek. And Puneet, I\\'d just say, that with revenue synergies often theoretical, when you do an acquisition, we\\'ve actually have real proof points already with customers and markets that we can do this, and there\\'s real value to customers. Okay. Great. And if I could touch on the NASD business. Just wanted to get a sense of if you could quantify how much was that and sort of in the quarter. And the current run rate that you have in sort of what -- what\\'s your expectation longer term here? Has that changed from the sort of the earlier expectation in the comments that you gave around customers demanding the RNAi product and the overall long-term view of the business? Yes. Much like avoiding the temptation of talking about FY \\'20 guide, I\\'ll also avoid the temptation to talk about specific details on a product line level. But what I can do is give you a directional number. So I think we\\'ve been talking about this business hitting probably $100 million or so this year. And then, as we look into FY \\'20, we\\'ve added at least that much in terms of capacity. So we hope to be up to a larger number in the -- by the end of next year at the sort of a run rate level, at a higher number. We\\'re not ready to kind of commit to what the number actually is, but it\\'s going to be a pretty -- a nice step up for us. And Bob, I know you\\'ve been doing some modeling in this area as well already. Yes. I think Puneet, I mean, nothing has changed. We had a very good quarter. We\\'re expecting another very good quarter next year -- or next quarter, excuse me, largely in the back of our existing capacity. And the team has just done a fantastic job. As Mike said, we\\'re on pace to delivering that $100 million consistent with what we said, really, since the beginning of the year. And we\\'re excited about the new facility coming online. And as Mike mentioned, it\\'s bringing on manufacturing capacity right now and look forward to \\'20 and beyond serving our customers And by the way, don\\'t interpret my comments as being any less bullish in this space. We just know that as we bring on the new facility, you have to time when you actually can start the batches up, but a lot of that is being driven by customers timing when they\\'re doing the clinical trials. So we\\'re much more specific when we do our FY \\'20 guide because we\\'ll have a much better handle on the timing when these new customers will be coming into our new facility. I can tell you we\\'ve sold a good percentage of that capacity already. One thing that we\\'ve already stated is the basis of this as the number of clinical trials and work being done here. We see the supplier opportunity for us going from $0.5 billion market to over $750 million over the next several years. So we\\'re going to grow with that. And it is a fact, too, that we are doubling our overall capacity for manufacturing. But I just want to reemphasize what both Mike and Bob said that there is a ramp up process over a number of years. So just because we\\'re doubling our capacity, doesn\\'t mean we\\'re going to be double our revenue there. Just to be explicit about that again. But we\\'ll be very... First, I was just wondering, can you go into a bit more detail on your strong results in environmental and forensics? I think this is the fourth quarter in a row of high single-digit or double-digit growth there. So I\\'d just be curious to hear more details on the drivers in that end market. Yes. And again, it speaks to the portfolio we build up here over the past years on really robust reliable instrumentation that allow us to really go into -- of course, opioid is a big crisis here in U.S. So we have actually quite a large growth in that area. We also seen soil and water. Here in U.S, which have actually driven a lot of business. And the same token, China has actually continued to have strong growth in both those areas, specifically the environmental, which is heavily regulated. So we are doing very well in regulated spaces, and this has driven also the momentum and forensic this quarter. I was just going to say, if I could add to that too, in concert with Jacob, we\\'ve been working a lot on the environmental side in terms of the end market workflows and complementary consumables and services to go along with it. So that\\'s clearly another driver of this end market for us. Okay. And then, we heard one of your peers talk about starting to see a bias against U.S. companies in some China tenders. Are you seeing signs of that dynamic as well? Catherine, thanks for asking that question. Not at all. So that\\'s always been the risk of the heightened tensions between U.S. and China as it relates to trade. We have not at all seen that in our business. I only have one question, but it has three or four parts. So I know -- I don\\'t want to disappoint. So I know you\\'re up against a tough comp in Q4, and I\\'m guessing there\\'s some desire to be a bit more conservative in the current environment. That said, given the strength of really, ACG and DGG in Q3 and really the past few quarters, we would have expected Q4 revenue growth guidance to be a bit higher. So one, were there any timing dynamics that benefited Q3 at the expense of Q4? Two, did you see any end market conditions weaken over the course of Q3? And if so, are you baking in an assumption into guidance that this continues in the fourth quarter? Three, are you assuming that LSAG growth is lower in Q4 versus the flat performance in Q3? Because it seems like you\\'d have to unless you\\'re expecting ACG and/or DGG to moderate. And four, kind of building up on the last one, I\\'m just wondering if NASD is not expected to be as strong in Q4 as Q3, maybe just because things have to pause a little bit as you bring new capacity on. Yes. So Doug, we\\'ve been waiting for these questions. So thanks for putting it out there. And I\\'ll start off, and then have Bob share some of our guide velocity. So I really want to be really clear on this. We saw nothing unusual relative to pulling in from the fourth quarter. So our book-to-bill is solid. And so there\\'s nothing unusual we have in terms of changing the seasonality business by pulling in from Q4 into Q3. When we look at our LSAG business, we actually expected a decline in Q4 off that tough compare. I think you\\'re off 9% last year. And now there\\'s two other parts. I only got two of the four parts. Yes. I wrote some of them down. So Doug, I\\'ll try to tag team with Mike. As Mike said, we didn\\'t see any pull forward or any dynamic that took orders out of Q4 into Q3. And as you said, our backlog actually did not deteriorate. But that being said, you\\'re seeing it. We saw it today, right, in the market. There\\'s a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The trade resolution is nowhere -- it\\'s no closer now than it was when we had our call back in Q2. And so we\\'re de-risking Q4 a little bit relative to where we were. It is a tough comp. And there is a little more uncertainty in the marketplace today than it was even 3 months ago, and we\\'re trying to be prudent there. That being said, we raised the full year on the top line and certainly on the bottom line, and feel good about that.  To your question about NASD, we are expecting that growth to moderate. It had a very strong Q4 of last year. But when you look at the run rate, we still feel very good about the run rate. So it\\'s less about level loading and manufacturing and it\\'s more about just comparables there. And we are expecting continued performance in both ACG and DGG, not necessarily at the double-digit rate. That would be good, but that\\'s not built into our guide. And as Mike said, we are expecting a flattish to slightly down in LSAG just given the strong 9% compare that we had in Q4 of last year. Maybe one on ACG for you, Mike, and I\\'m sure Mark can chime in. It was right in there with the best growth you guys have ever put up in that segment, even while facing a high single-digit comp. So how are you guys continuing to drive that segment to these levels of growth? I mean, it\\'s been years since you had that initial refocus. How are we still seeing follow through? What\\'s really driving the reacceleration demand? Yes. So I\\'ll take the congratulations on behalf of Mark, but then pass it on to Mark. But you\\'re exactly right. I can remember the early days. We were getting questions about when was this going to stop? And we said why would it stop? Because there\\'s a number of things doing and there\\'s also an expanding market underway. And as Mark pointed out, the strength was broad based across consumer services.  I mean, we really think we\\'re playing into -- and I tried to highlight this into my script, that really playing into some real changing customer needs. They really want something that\\'s going to help drive their productivity and they are also looking for at times vendors to take on some of the work they\\'ve been doing inside. And then, on the consumables front, they really want these integrated workflows. But I can\\'t do the strategy justice. So Mark, why don\\'t you fill in the pieces that I\\'ve missed. Thanks, Mike. And Patrick, I guess, maybe it\\'s a little bit of the past, but also the future, and we\\'re still very bullish about our potential to grow. But some of the drivers made really significant investments in the expansion of our portfolios. And from services, we\\'ve got breadth to now in more of our value-added services. And the enterprise capabilities that will not only have a rollout over the continuation this year and in the consumables business, it\\'s an intentional drive to drive for more complete workflows for targeted end markets. And we called out biopharma in particular, a high-growth market, where we\\'ve really been focused around grabbing that. So portfolio is a big driver. We\\'re really getting some great results from expanding our reach and our ability to wallet share growth inside of our current accounts to reach and lease subscriptions, still a lot of opportunity there. We still have a significant opportunity to improve our attachment rates to the Agilent instruments. But I always like to come back and remind everyone, we view our market not only as the Agilent installed base, but also the competitions. And that adds a significant size and scale to the market opportunity. And not only we can take market share from our competitions on a multi-vendor perspective, we are.  So to kind to sum it up. A lot of work that\\'s been done over the past, build a lot of capabilities from the standpoint of portfolio, digital, working on some fundamental basics around what we can do in the attachment rate from the sales channel and our big market opportunity out there. So hope that gives you a sense of where we\\'ve been, a little bit of where we\\'re going too. Yes. That\\'s helpful color. And then maybe just a quick one for Bob, on the share repurchase front. It was encouraging to see you guys step in and be opportunistic with the $550 million this quarter. How should we think about it going forward. Obviously, the market has pulled back a decent amount, your stock along with it. So maybe just provide some perspective on that front. Yes. Thanks, Patrick, and appreciate you acknowledging that. And we\\'ll continue to evaluate the market. Obviously, our focus is first on growth, and we\\'ll be closing the BioTek acquisition this quarter. And our M&A funnel continues to be strong, and we will be looking at that, but not afraid to go into the market if the price is right, so to speak. So I think the way that we are looking at that is first on M&A, and then looking to continue to deploy capital, where as I mentioned before, cash neutral right now with the acquisition of the BioTek, we\\'ll probably be at net debt of roughly onetime. And so we still have plenty of capacity there. Most of my questions have been asked. Just 2 things, for you, I guess. First, Mike, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more and provide any more color on some of the new products you recently launched and how they\\'re being accepted into the market, particularly the new GCs as well as the new iQ system. And then, I guess, secondly, for Bob or Mike if you want to take it, are you able to quantify how much you\\'re expecting in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter from the new NASD facility you\\'re starting up here? Yes. So if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll make some summary comments, then Jacob, you can just fill in some of the details. But last number, that\\'s our view on our new GC family launch was actually ahead of where we thought we\\'d be. And I think we\\'re doing well on the iQ as well. But -- and maybe you can kind of fill in some details there. Yes. Certainly, I think we are -- despite some challenging market conditions, we\\'re actually doing extremely well with the 88 series and in front of our -- on our own ramped volume. So I think that is working very well, and it\\'s really the combination of what we call the smart instrument combined with our already proven -- well proven technology, GC technology. And that really resonates with our customers. The same can actually be said with our iQ, which of course, a little -- only was introduced a few weeks ago out at the ASMS and we start to ship here very soon. We have received the first orders. But what I can say there is that it has been very well received where we have been out introducing it and presenting it to customers. I think they very much like the ease-of-use intuitiveness of the detector itself. And also, all the self awareness that it have. So it really helps the customer to be successful, not only successful, but also allow them to be -- you have much more uptime in a laboratory. And this really addresses the QA QC labs, where it\\'s all about being uptime and of course, get things with the laboratory. So it\\'s been really well-received, but it\\'s still early days for the iQ. So we have received orders, but we are shipping in this quarter here. Steve, just on NASD, it\\'s going to be, as we\\'ve said earlier in the year, it\\'s not going to be material to the overall numbers. So it\\'s going to be low single millions. Congrats on the quarter guys. I was hoping to ask a question back to China. Can you just provide some color on, like, what the actual generic business did in the quarter, like what the level of revenues was year-over-year? And then, while I appreciate, I think, to Tycho\\'s question you don\\'t want to give a specific number for 2020. But just given, I think, the investors in ourselves who are just trying to get some frame of reference, like directionally. Is there any help you can provide? Just as we go to 2020, I know you made a comment to Tycho, but just a little more help, if you could, directionally, on the food and the China generic side, how to think about that? Yes. So happy to, let me take the second part of that question first, which is when you think about the outlook for \\'20 again, well you know I\\'m going to stay way from percentage changes in growth rates. But I think we have a lot more confidence around where the generic side of that marketplace is going because we only have some proof points.  We\\'ve already seen, which is -- the thesis was in the second quarter, hey, we think this is going to lead to, ultimately, more business. But there was a pause in business. We actually saw that play out in the third quarter. And we think it will play out in the fourth quarter, where the winners are going to be buying the equipment. We think the same thing is going to happen in Q2 -- I mean, excuse me, FY \\'20. It will be more an FY \\'20 event in terms of what impacts the P&L because we know what the process, we know what\\'s going to happen. We know the winners who we have deep relationships with are going to invest. So I think we have a level of confidence about where that market is going. I don\\'t think the same thing can be said about the food market because that\\'s why I used the word foreseeable future. What we do now is the commercial side of that segment will continue to grow. That will continue to grow. It\\'s unclear right now what\\'s going to be happening relative to China\\'s desire to invest in the government labs. As you heard from Jacob earlier, right now, they\\'re prioritizing, for example, investments in environmental, and that\\'s why we\\'re seeing strong environmental growth. And Bob, maybe it\\'s worth just kind of parsing out. I was just thinking how our business is in -- I can\\'t give a specific number relative to generics. But just in terms of size of our pharma business in China, and then roughly how much of it is in the non-biopharma side. Yes. So our -- maybe just to comment on the food, Dan, on the -- on Q4, as I said earlier, we\\'re expecting it to be roughly that $40 million, which will be down year-on-year, pretty consistent with how we -- our results in Q2 and Q3. And the question is, over time, we do think that, that business will come back, not at the levels that had been in the past, just given the different dynamics. But the question is when and we\\'re not ready to call that yet. On the pharma side, the business actually did better in Q3 than it did in Q2. And of roughly China is roughly 20% of the overall business and pharma is about 30% of that -- 20%. So it\\'s about 6% overall. And it\\'s roughly 50-50 in terms of consumables and instruments. So it\\'s roughly 2% to 3% of our overall company. And in Q3, it grew. As Mike mentioned, really on the back of the winners of the 4+7 and just kind of clarity on what this pilot meant going forward. So that\\'s probably as much detail as we\\'re going to get into relative to this. And we\\'ll have another quarter under our belt for Q4 and then be better prepared to talk about it as things unfold for the fiscal year next, in November. Great. And if I could, since it is the last question. Just one more. Mike, obviously, a very strong quarter. You mentioned kind of similar to what you\\'ve been talking about. Obviously, we could see what\\'s going on, with continued uncertainty out in the marketplace, especially for, I think, for cap equipment. And Bob, you talked about PMIs, but you also talked about good book-to-bills and you had a good quarter. So any way to help us think about, like, as we try to tease out all the noise that\\'s out there in the marketplace, kind of what it means for Agilent on a go-forward basis, like PMIs, do we want that? Do we pay a lot to influence that? Or just any more color about the customer conversations you\\'re having, and kind of how it relates back to these comments. Sure. Yes. Happy to do so. So first thing I would do is I would set aside 60% of the business of Agilent, which is in the recurring revenue side of the business. And we talked a lot about the DGG business, the ACG business, and our view that we\\'re going to have continued strength there. And then, what we\\'ve been trying to do is position the business. Hey, listen, there is this 40% of the business, which is instruments. And that does -- it\\'s predicted by PMI. I think you may recall you and I have our conversation, but I think still some of the models still hold, which is the PMI trends do drive, to some extent, what\\'s going to happen ultimately in the capital goods side. I think we\\'ve already seen it. PMI started dropping earlier this year. Albeit there are some areas of Jacob\\'s business, which are still somewhat independent of that whether it will be the 4+7 initiatives, some policy changes, some of the things that happen in environmental, forensics. So I think its sort of a -- it\\'s a mixed model. So -- the first thing I\\'d do is start off by just saying, let\\'s set aside 60% of the business over here, and then start talking about the 40%, and then parse out the cell analysis piece, which is by itself is a high growing business driven by certain dynamics there. And then parse out some of the policy driven stuff, then you\\'re left with, primarily, chemical energy exposure. Bob how would you think about that? No. Maybe I\\'d just leave it here. I mean, I think we feel very good about our portfolio. Obviously, we can\\'t time the markets from the standpoint of market growth. But we think that we\\'re able to gain share in any market, and I think this quarter proves that. Our portfolio is strong. We continued to invest in areas that are faster growing than the overall company, things like cell analysis and then also our biopharma businesses across all three business groups. So I think Mike mentioned it in the prepared remarks that the business is a lot different than it was five years ago. And I think we continue to invest in fast-growing areas, continuing to transform it and make it a much more resilient model. And I think we feel good about that certainly for not only Q4, but going forward. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there’ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And now, I’d like to introduce you to the host for today’s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent’s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob’s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent’s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent’s CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today’s discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today’s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of October 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. When I became CEO, I knew we had the opportunity to become a growth company. We would do this by investing in fast-growing markets with a building and buying approach. We also set out to create a more resilient company business model, capable of delivering strong earnings in a variety of market conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a roader base of growth and a more flexible and efficient cost structure. As you know, transforming a decades-old company is not an easy task, but I believed in the strength and determination of the Agilent team. The fourth quarter and full-year results I will share today are a testament to the commitment of the Agilent team and their ability to step up to meet this challenge. We strongly closed our fiscal 2019, with fourth quarter results exceeding our expectations. Agilent’s Q4 revenue of $1.37 billion is up 4% on a core basis against a 9% compare. And we have momentum going into 2020 as orders outpaced revenue. EPS of $0.89 is up 10% for the quarter. Both our top line revenue and EPS are above the high-end of our fourth quarter guidance. Operating margin of 25.1% is up 50 basis points over last year. Q4 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by the Agilent team. Our higher than expected top line is led by 10% core growth from our Agilent CrossLab Group. Business is also strong for our Diagnostics and Genomics Group, delivering 7% core growth. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets revenues are in line with expectations, down 2% against a 9% growth compare. The pharma, diagnostics and clinical, and the environmental and forensics markets continue to lead our growth. High single-digit U.S. growth is stronger than forecasted with other regions coming in as expected. Growth in China declined low single digits as expected. Agilent’s growth strategy of building and buying in fast-growing markets is on full display in Q4. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of BioTek. This is our largest acquisition since the launch of the new Agilent in 2015. BioTek brings a superb team and an excellent high-growth, highly profitable business to Agilent. The acquisition of BioTek complements our earlier acquisition this year of ACEA BioSciences. Both acquisitions are part of our growing cell analysis business serving biopharma and academic research customers. Agilent’s cell analysis business is now generating more than $250 million in annual revenue, about 5% of company revenues, and is growing at a double-digit rate. We are also continuing to invest internally to drive new organic growth. In Q4, we recognized the first revenue from our new oligo API manufacturing site in Frederick, Colorado. The high-quality, GMP grade oligos produced at this site are key to a new class of drugs being developed by our biopharma customers. Investing in this facility is part of our overall strategy to build a larger biopharma business. We are expecting continued strong growth in this business as we ramp volume throughout the coming year. Finally, in October, I traveled to the UK to open a new state-of-the-art facility at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. The site will be a major R&D hub for laser spectroscopy and will also incorporate Agilent’s Raman spectroscopy business. Our recent acquisitions and these capital investments in Colorado and the UK are very visible examples of our continued and relentless focus on investing for growth. Hey, let’s now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2019 results. We had a very solid year, generating $5.2 billion in revenue, representing 5% core growth. Strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics, and environmental and forensics markets led the way. Regionally, the U.S. set the pace, growing in the high single digits. The U.S. was followed by mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. Europe and China grew at low single digits for the year. Full-year earnings per share grew 11% to $3.11. The result is another year of double-digit earnings per share growth. The full-year operating margin of 23.3% is up 80 basis points over 2018, despite a full-year of tariff related duties. Our investments in ACG continue to yield dividends. ACG grew a stellar 10% for the year. We are helping customers transform their analytical lab operations by anticipating and meeting their evolving needs. DGG is also delivering very strong results, with 9% core growth for the year. We’re capturing market share in our pathology business, expanding our presence in next-gen sequencing and further building our oligo API business. During the year, DGG crossed the billion-dollar revenue threshold and now represents approximately 20% of Agilent’s business. LSAG revenues declined 1% on a core basis as we faced some market headwinds. We remain committed to investing for future LSAG growth and market share gains. Our new product development pipeline remains full. During the year, we introduced a number of innovative new products, including the launch of a new family of groundbreaking gas chromatographs and molecular spectroscopy instruments. At this year’s ASMS Conference, we introduced several new differentiated LC/MS offerings, including the 6546 LC-QTOF and 6495C LC triple-quad systems. As we head in 2020, our LSAG product portfolio and go-to-customer field team have never been stronger. Agilent continues to operate from a position of strength. We are well-positioned to capture market share. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model: deliver above market growth, while expanding operating margins, along with a balanced deployment of capital with a priority on investing for growth. The result, delivery of superior earnings per share growth. In driving value creation, we’ve built a broader base of growth and a more resilient business model. We were tested this year with economic and political uncertainties leading to subdued demand for new instrument purchases. Yet, we delivered 5% core growth, operating margins improved 80 basis points and delivered another year of double-digit EPS growth. We deployed more than $1.5 billion in M&A and growth-focused capital investments. On the M&A front, we’re very pleased with the performance to date of BioTek and ACEA BioSciences. We remain on the hunt for similar types of growth opportunities. I’m increasingly confident in the Agilent team’s ability to pursue larger-scale acquisitions and deliver on value creation synergies. We continue to review potential acquisitions as part of our building and buying growth strategy. Now more than ever, I’m convinced we’re in an exceptionally strong position for the future. This is particularly relevant as we move into 2020, a milestone for us at Agilent as we celebrate 20 years as an independent company. While uncertainties persist in some end-markets as we start fiscal year 2020, we’re operating from a position of strength. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, working as a One Agilent on behalf of our customers and shareholders. I’m very proud of the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. I know you’ve heard me say this before, but I truly believe the best is yet to come for Agilent, our customers and our investors. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. I mean, that was a Freudian [ph] slip. I’ll now hand the call off to Bob. We don’t have a new CEO – CFO. Bob, you want to take it from here? Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I’ll provide some additional revenue detail and take you through the fourth quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I’ll then finish up with our guidance for 2020 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike indicated, our fourth quarter results were very good with strong execution throughout the P&L. For the quarter, revenue was $1.37 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 4%. Reported growth was stronger at 6%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by roughly 2 points, while acquisitions added 4 points to overall revenue, reflecting the impact of a partial quarter of revenue from the BioTek acquisition in addition to earlier acquisitions. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, had 7% core growth in the quarter, especially impressive off of a tough 14% comparison from last year. Our large molecule biopharma business and CrossLab strength continue to drive strong results. Geographically, all regions grew with the strongest growth in Americas and China. In speaking of China, despite the debate regarding the pharma market and the 4+7 program, our pharma business in China grew double digits for the year. Continuing revenue in the environmental and forensics market grew 9% in the quarter. This is against a very tough compare of 17% growth last year. Growth was balanced between LSAG and ACG and continues to be driven by evolving regulations, especially concerning opioids. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 7% during Q4, led by strength in our pathology and companion diagnostics businesses. Within pathology, continued expansion of our PD-L1 business was a key highlight. Revenue from the chemical and energy end market came in as expected, with 1% growth. Decline in instruments were offset by strength in the CrossLab’s business. Academia and government declined 4% against the tough compare of 10% growth last year. We still see the funding environments in academia and government remaining stable though. And finally, consistent with expectations, food revenue declines about 5% due to the China food market. Despite the year-over-year declines, we were encouraged that for the third quarter in a row, the run rate in China continues to be stable. On a geographic basis, the Americas came in stronger than expected with 9% growth during the quarter, led by strong results in the pharma, diagnostics and environmental markets. Europe modestly exceeded our expectations, delivering a 4% growth rate with balance strength across most markets and groups. China came in as expected, declining in the low single digits against a very strong compare of 16% growth last year. Excluding food, China was up slightly. In wrapping up, Asia ex-China declined low single digits. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 56.5%. This was down 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by product mix in LSAG, the start-up costs at our Frederick, Colorado site and a higher revenue mix from ACG. It’s reporting to remember that, while ACG’s gross margin is lower than the company average due to the services component, the ACG business has done a fantastic job of driving strong operating margin leverage. In fact, ACG’s operating margin led the company for the quarter and the year. So ACG is not only helping drive our recurring revenues, it’s doing so at a very accretive pace. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 25.1%, up 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage and strong expense management. The quarter also capped off full-year operating margin of 23.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.89, up 10% versus last year and $0.03 higher than the top-end of our guidance. And as Mike mentioned, our full-year earnings per share of $3.11 increased 11% versus last year. Now turning to some other financial metrics. For the quarter, we generated $314 million in operating cash flow. We acquired BioTek for $1.165 billion and returned $100 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Lastly in the quarter, we took advantage of market conditions and refinanced $500 million of senior notes early, producing our future interest costs. All in all, a very active quarter. Now before moving to next year’s guidance, I want to recap how we have deployed capital this year. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we plan to focus our capital deployment towards growth-oriented assets and driving returns to our shareholders. To that end, we’ve deployed over $2.3 billion this year: $1.4 billion in M&A for BioTek and ACEA and more than $900 million in share repurchases and dividends. And we ended the year with a very healthy balance sheet, allowing plenty of capacity for further capital deployment. Now let’s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the 2020 fiscal year, beginning with the full-year guidance. For the full-year, we’re expecting revenue to range from $5.50 billion to $5.55 billion, representing core growth of 4% to 5% and reported growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Currency is estimated to negatively impact growth by 0.3 percentage points with M&A contributing roughly 2.7 to 2.9 percentage points of growth for the full-year. From a group perspective, we expect ACG to sustain the momentum and deliver high single-digit growth, driven by broad-based strength. The DGG business is expected to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate with our NASD Frederick facility ramping throughout the year, and we anticipate a modest recovery for LSAG roughly flat on a core basis. Now moving down the P&L, we expect modest operating leverage. And also embedded in our forecast is we expect the other income and expense line to be roughly $40 million to $45 million in net expense, with year-over-year change driven largely by the interest expense as we enter the year in a net debt position. We expect our tax rate to improve by 50 basis points to slightly above 16% and our full-year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $312 million, essentially flat to Q4 of this year and reflecting only anti-dilutive share repurchases throughout the year. All this translates to non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $3.38 and $3.43 per share, resulting in 9% to 10% growth on a reported basis. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $775 million to $800 million. This includes a one-time tax outflow of roughly $230 million in the first quarter to transfer certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions. This tax will reduce our U.S. transition tax dollar-for-dollar and will provide us with operational and tax benefits in the future. We’ve also announced raising our dividend by 10%, continuing a streak of double-digit increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now turning into Q1 guidance. For Q1, we’re expecting revenue to range from $1.34 billion to $1.355 billion, representing reported growth of 4.3% to 5.5% and core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. The lower organic growth in Q1 reflects the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year, which this year falls into our fiscal first quarter. We anticipate this adversely affecting the growth rate in the first quarter by roughly 1 point. In addition, the growth rate takes into account the Frederick site ramp that will occur over the year. First Quarter 2020 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.81 per share, representing reported growth of 5% to 7%. EPS growth in Q1 is lower than the full-year based on the revenue growth, the Frederick start-up costs and certain share-based compensation costs that are expensed in the first quarter. Now before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are very pleased with the results our Agilent team was able to achieve this past year, while continuing to take focus on taking full advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We are positioning our business towards stronger secular growth markets and driving higher recurring revenue streams. We clearly saw the results of this in 2019 and we entered 2020 with a strong portfolio and with momentum. …and thank you for taking my questions. So maybe first with just a cleanup question. Did fiscal 2019 NASD revenue come in around $100 million as expected? And can you give us more detail on what you’re assuming for NASD revenue in 2020? I know you said you expect it to ramp over the course of the year. But if you actually gave a number, I might have missed that. Thanks, Doug. Yes, it came in generally in line a little better than that and we’re expecting very significant growth in FY 2020. Okay. So recognizing it, we don’t have a specific number, but just talking about it qualitatively and maybe taking everything up a level. You set the low-end of 2020 core revenue growth guidance at 4%. And this would be the – I think, the lowest core growth rate since at least 2011. And whatever that tailwind is from NASD, it makes the setting guidance at those levels even more notable. Based on what you guys just did in the quarter and the way you sound, that – it seems like you’re really just setting the bar at a level that embed some pretty conservative assumptions on the low-end. So I guess, specifically, would you guys be willing to talk about what conditions would need to exist for this scenario to become reality? Things like – at 4%, what are you assuming for China food? What are you assuming for 4+7 in terms of the downside risk there? And is there something you’re factoring in that would suggest there’s a scenario where things actually get worse in terms of overall global capital equipment demand? Yes. Thanks, Doug. Let me start and then Bob will jump in on this. So I think we don’t want to overthink this one. So this is our initial guide for the year. And you’re right, it would represent, if, in fact, that was an actual growth number – our loss growth rate in a number of years. But it’s just an initial guide, as you heard earlier, you heard a lot of words as expected with upside. So, we’re going to position our initial guide with the room for upside on the plan for the year. And… Yes, I would say, Doug, to build on what Mike was saying. I think we were taking a kind of a prudent approach to guidance. Obviously, if we were at that level, we’d be disappointed and something would happen in the macro economic environment that we’re not expecting. We’re not seeing anything right now that would suggest that the market conditions are getting any worse. This – that would suggest that market conditions probably would get worse and LSAG would not come back and it would continue to decline. But we’re, again, we’re at the beginning of the year there. Our – I think, we’re prudent here, but we like to believe that there’s a lot of opportunities for growth going forward. …hey, good afternoon. I’m wondering if you could talk on small molecule performance in the quarter. I know earlier in the year, you talked about a slowing global pharma business. Just curious how you’re thinking about the replacement cycle and was any of the instruments slowdown on the pharma side? In fact, Tycho, I think you’re – hey, Tycho, happy to jump in on this one and feel free Jacob to add your comments as well. But in Q2, we called out what seemed to be a slowing replacement cycle – replacement level in the generic side or small molecule side of the Pharma segment. We really haven’t seen any evidence of that in the third and fourth quarter. And as Bob mentioned in the script, we had double-digit growth in pharma, 4+7 initiative, which is heavily focused on small molecule is not impacting our business. We put a really solid numbers. And I think we’re seeing the growth in small molecule fairly healthy, along with higher levels in the biopharma side. But really the pressure on the instrument side really on a growth rate perspective has really come in the food segment, primarily in China as well as the global chemical energy market. And, Jacob, I don’t know if you have anything else you’d like to add there? Mike, I think you have covered a lot of it. The only thing to add there is that, we, as you mentioned, but – that we do see the growth in the QA/QC environment, maybe less in the discovery from small molecules. But we continue to expect that volume will be there and continue to increase in the small molecules going forward also. Okay. And then, Mike, for your commentary on C&E, for instruments, are you assuming any recovery next year on the instrument side? No. That’s basically flat, kind of basically flat conditions. So – and back to the question, Doug, you asked earlier, if we would see some improvement in the chemical energy that would really represent upside to our our initial guide. So we’re assuming kind of continued conditions. They’ve been challenged this year. So we’re assuming they continue into FY 2020, no change there. But if it would change the positive that would be upside to our current plan. And I think the resilience of our model really showed in this past quarter and the full-year, which is, while chemical industry is down on the instrument side, we actually had some modest growth there when – with the aftermarket side of our business. Okay. And then one quick one for Bob, just to close on the M&A comments. Can you just remind us your framework? Are you still assuming $1 billion-ish type deal would be the ceiling where we’re obviously getting the question a lot as other analysts? No, no, let me take that one. If it wasn’t clear in the script, I actually explicitly said that we’re increasingly confident on our ability to take on larger-scale acquisitions and deliver on value creation and synergies. I would not put a ceiling like that on our appetite for deals. Yes. Yes, we are still committed to being investment grade. Obviously, being ending the year at roughly a little less than one-time net debt levered. That gives us a lot of opportunity to – if the right deal were there to kind of lever up with the commitment to kind of paying back down. Now, again, we’re going to be remained financially disciplined and focused on returns, but we do have a fair amount of room there. Mike or Bob, could you give us any color in terms of what you’ve penciled in for China for fiscal 2020? And to sort of speak to your level of visibility in the food business and perhaps some early traction that you might be getting with some of those private labs? Yes. Yes, I’ll start and then Mike, or perhaps, Jake, if you wanted to add anything. We are expecting a modest recovery in China next year. We ended this year at roughly 1%, a large part of that being the headwinds that we’re seeing in food. We’re expecting that China to become kind of low single digits to mid high, or mid single digits, depending on kind of that food recovery. We have some – the good news is, over the last three quarters, we’ve been roughly averaging this $40 million per quarter that we talked about. So we’re on this trajectory of – in China being $160 million kind of run rate. And our expectation is that, we’ll continue to – we’re not going to speculate growth there, but be at that level next year, which will help the rest of the business grow. So we will – because we won’t have that headwind. Yes, I think it’s really important that we define what do we mean by recovery, which mainly means continue at the flat level it’s been running for the last three quarters, about $40 million a quarter. And just to put a number on this, I believe, Bob, about 4 points of our growth in China this year was impacted by the food market. So we fast forward, you could do the math and said, okay, it would just stays flat with what we’ve seen for the last three quarters. You’d expect that we would grow above what we’ve grown this year in China. And then to your question about the contract testing side, Jacob, I think it’s high single-digit growth there. So… Yes. We – I was actually recently here in China. And clearly, the private labs are doing quite well. We see strong growth now from a different base than where we are on the government labs. But even with the government labs and certain types are – there are certain some investments going in, but not to the level that we’ve seen before. So that’s why we don’t see a lot of movements right now. We won’t. Thanks. And a follow-up for Bob. Could you just elaborate a little more color on the tax hit, the one-time tax hit on the cash full on you expect in the first quarter? And kind of the mechanics of what it relates to in terms of the intangibles, reclassification, and any implications it might have for the tax rate beyond next year? Thanks. Yes. So it is a one-time opportunity that we have afforded ourselves. We’re moving some intangible property out of one of our acquisitions into our tax model. It’s going to require us to pay the $230 million upfront in taxes, but that’s going to be creditable to our already existing liability for our U.S. transition tax. And so it’s effectively a one-for-one kind of credit there. So it’s not an incremental cost to us over time. And what it allows us to do by putting this – it’s related to the Dako acquisition. It allows us to streamline our operational activities, as well as overtime, generate some tax benefits. That will likely happen in 2021 and beyond, so it’s part of our kind of multi-year tax planning initiatives that we’ve been talking about. …Mike, maybe a big picture question. I just – if I think about where PMIs are, I think, PMIs are bottoming out. But from your commentary, I guess, what you’re saying is, you’re still expecting whatever trends we saw for 2019 as a base case, you’re assuming those trends continue into next year. I’m just curious PMIs are bottoming out, why is that a reasonable assumption going forward? I want to see the orders first. So – and back – getting back to the earlier question about guide, that’s why we went into level we did, which was, if you go back and look at Agilent’s overall results for 2019, they really were quite strong. But the growth came from different parts of the businesses than we expected. And we’re sitting in Q2 and Q1 last year, PMIs started dropping, and you see – saw a level of conservatism in our customer-buying behavior. So we said, okay, there’s reason to believe to your point that it could actually be a different environment in 2020. Let’s not guide assuming that. Let’s just – let’s see it happen and then we’ll take up the guide appropriately and take the orders of business. Yes. I think, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Mike is saying. I mean, what we’re trying to do like everyone else is kind of read the tea leaves. And our best view is that, until we start seeing something different that it’s going to remain the same as it is today. And if it does rebound, that would be good. We would like that. Yes. That – that’s helpful, guys. And then, Bob, one quick question on operating leverage. It looks like the guide is contemplating modest operating leverage, maybe 30, 35 basis points for next year. I’m just – I mean, that Q4 performance, this is really impressive what you guys did on the OpEx side. Any thoughts on why maybe leverage for next year, Rob, moderates a little bit? Is that maybe a little bit more spend to – on the growth initiatives you guys have? Yes, some of it is that and we have a full-year of the Frederick costs that are going to be built into the results in 2020 that we didn’t have. We really just had that in Q4. And obviously, Q4 is one of our strongest years of – our strongest quarter. So we get a lot of leverage there. But we feel pretty good about that. And I think we’ve demonstrated this year an ability to manage our operating expenses to continue to drive double-digit growth on the earnings side and continue to drive operating margin leverage. So I think, you should feel confident that we’ll continue to do that going forward. Hi, Mike, thanks for the time here, again. A few things I’d like to tie up. I mean, Mike, I wonder if first, you might elaborate a little bit on a point that you made in your prepared remarks. When you said that orders in the quarter actually grew, I believe faster than revenue. I wonder if you could talk about where you’re seeing acceleration? And to what extent, if any particular region, maybe Japan was a driver there knowing there are some tax incentives in Japan? Thanks. Thanks for doing that. We thought it was really important to give the audience a view of the order activity in the quarter. We typically don’t like to plan – we typically don’t comment on that. But given the Q1 guide and some of the nuances around Lunar New Year and such, I want to let you – let the audience know that we ended the year in a strong backlog position, but the orders really exceeding the amount of revenue for the quarter. And I’d say, the quarter in orders was very similar to the quarter in terms of the revenues that you saw, which was strength in the Americas, strengthen in pharma from an end market, very strong results in ACG, DGG, cell analysis. So – and then the environmental side continues to put up really great numbers off of double-digit compares. So I think the Q4 order book was very similar in terms of pattern and areas of strength that we saw on the revenue side that I commented in my script. Yes. Steve, to more specifically to your question on Japan, we did not see any one-time build there, that was at the end of the fiscal year. Our fiscal quarter actually was across that, that timeframe. So we saw normal growth in Japan, which actually speaks to kind of the broad-based strength that Mike was just talking about. Okay, great. Very helpful. And then just, let’s say, two very quick points to tie up with the model. I guess one on NASD. I know you don’t want to give a specific number as it relates to what the contribution on revenues might be for fiscal 2020. But could you spend a minute just on how close you are to getting capacity there booked up? And when you think it – whether it’s 2021 or 2022, we might see the Frederick location running closer to that incremental capacity and then actually, I’ll tie it up right there? Thanks, again, for all the help. …from the question earlier, in the Q&A, we felt very good about kind of where we ended up the year. We had very strong growth. And we ended up, as I mentioned, slightly above the $100 million. And as we had talked about before, there was $100 million of capacity that would be ramping up over the course of the year. Many folks have modeled kind of a $50 million number and that’s in the ballpark. And in the ramp is really dependent upon how the clinical trials go and so forth. And so, maybe I’ll turn it over to Sam, to talk about kind of some of the dynamics, but obviously, some very positive things that have happened in the market just recently. Yes, Bob, I think you you’ve already laid the groundwork. Steve, how are you? We continue to be excited about the NASD business. And Boulder, just to remind you, is an ongoing important part of our NASD capacity capability there. And there have been some announcements recently, you might have seen that they just really reaffirmed what’s in our plan, the ability to grow and support the growing demand in the market for our customers. So Bob, really, I don’t have a lot to add to what you already said. We expect by the time we exit the year and you’re running… So, Mike, maybe just on China, if you don’t mind. China, you said pharma grew double digits in the quarter in China. But could you just spike out the generic issue there? And kind of how did generics specifically do in the quarter? And maybe kind of what’s assumed in 2020 versus what you achieved in 2019 with generics there? Yes. How about if I used the word 4+7 in that whole segment, excuse me, that whole segment of small molecule, I think it was up double-digit for us. Yes. I mean, as Mike mentioned, we after the first 4+7 around and the winners were announced, we certainly also see we are market leader in that space and that by we have access to many of those customers out there. So we, of course, in demand from those customers also. That would be more 4+7 or more activities in that space. But generally, speaking, we feel that we have a quite good predictability in that market now. Yes. Dan, I think that actually played out the way we had thought during the year. Once the initial announcements were done and tendering process started, the whole market pause for us to release a good quarter. And then as we had thought would happen is the – once the winners were announced and we were actually over-indexed in those accounts, so we had already preexisting strong relationship with those customers. Then we would see this return to growth we saw it in Q3 and we saw it in Q4, and we think the – that momentum is with us as we move into 2020. Yes. I think Dan, this is Bob. Just to build on what Mike and Jake were saying. I think what we’ve seen is kind of the notion of the higher quality, higher volumes and our ability to provide not only instrumentation, but the consumables and the software associated with that to keep up time in the lab is really resonating with our customers. And so I think the combination of both the LSAG business and the ACG business is a true, what we think is a competitive differentiator across this, and this is a proof point for us. Great. Thank you for that. And then maybe back on C&E, I know, I think the Tycho’s question, Bob – Mike, excuse me, I think, you discussed instruments, maybe flat is the way to think about the outlook from here conservatively? Can you just maybe speak to kind of what the interest level is like from the Intuvo and then the two larger instrument platforms today? And kind of what are the guideposts towards when maybe we could see that instrument demand pickup? Because I assume there has to be some good latent demand for the new instruments. Yes. In fact, we’re already seeing that. So it’s actually when you dig into the details on the order book and the revenue results, in fact, we just had a review last week with Jacob on his ramp to volume. And he knew, the new 8890 and 8860 GCs are actually – it’s – on the dashboard, it shows green being head of our internal ramp to volume forecast. So we think that it’s already happening. And then other parts of the instrument portfolio, so the chemical energy aren’t seeing the same type of demand. But this shows you when you come out with a new set of offerings, the marketplaces have a clear value proposition to customers that drives productivity even in a market environment, where capital is a little bit tighter, you can get the order. And, Jacob, I know you’ve been out with some customers recently, but if you could anything else you’d like to add to that? Yes, absolutely. I think the 88 series really resonate with the customer base. And even though, it is a muted environment, we do see that there is interest and we do see, as you know, that we have a really strong ramp to volume. But the customer really like about it is that, we continue with the highest quality and highest performance in the market, but now also with a lot of what we call smart performance in the instruments – a lot of intelligence. So with instrument actually knows what it’s doing and it can put predictive maintenance in. In fact, we put out something that’s called smart alerts now that customers are really excited about that they can get an overview over their labs and get access to what’s actually happening instruments, so they can be predictive in their expectations. Hey. So actually, I wanted to follow on with that question thinking about the GC cycle and the upgrade. How much – can you estimate about how much the installed base was upgraded over the last few years. Now you’ve got a very big GC platform installed globally. Just curious in terms of where we are in the cycles once it picks up again? Yes. We have – generally speaking, when we look into our refresh cycle, we do see that the market is looking at approximately 10% per year of refresh. So that also means that our instruments is out there for quite a long time. We are actively looking into that. We we do see – we actually believe that we are in the middle of a refresh cycle. It has been challenged with the overall market conditions. So we do believe actually when the market is coming back to when the PMI are starting to turn that that we would see an acceleration in that refresh cycle. I think it’s fair to say to Jacob, there’s always, if you will, a replacement going on. Just – how much has actually been replaced. And I think we continue to see fairly high levels of aging in the installed base, which would point to perhaps somewhat of an acceleration of the replacement rate, assuming the market environment would improve. Yes. Yes. Hey, Derik, one other thing that I think is probably pertinent here, it’s still early days. But when – if you recall, the launch is both at the high-end and the mid range. And what we really excited about was the potential to have a really compelling offering at the mid range, where we had not as much penetration as we did at the high-end. And while Mike was talking about our ramp to volume, Mike and Jake were talking about a ramp to volume being green for the business if you kind of parse them out. I would say the mid price or the mid value range is dark green. And so, once the China food business starts to snap back or come to pick up, again, I guess, can you – how should we think about that business? I mean, is there going to be a V-shaped curve since rebound is the latent demand there or is it going to be – is that market going to be a little bit less than we had grown in the past just given some new organizations in that market? Yes. I think we won’t see the type of double-digit declines we saw this year. As Jacob mentioned on the actual volume side, the number of samples being run is up double-digit. The money has been down sharply at the central government level. We don’t expect that’s going to be the long-term situation. So right now for 2020, again, we’re just saying it’s going to be flat with the level we’ve seen for the last three quarters. That being said, our internal view is that this is kind of a mid single-digit kind of grower. It’s going to – I mean, the China market itself is going to be least 6% to 8% growth rate and this is probably about where this business could be. It won’t be at the toward double-digit growth that is seen for the past decade. That being said, you won’t see these double-digit declines that we experienced in 2019. That’s why when we talk about a modest recovery in China really is, we’re just talking about lapping the compare on the food – from the food business. One final question. I mean, you’ve done a lot of acquisitions in the cell biology space recently. And admittedly, I’m a molecular biologist by training, I’m a cell biologist. So can you help me understand what you’re offering that’s novel in terms of how you put all these pieces together? And just sort of what are you bringing to market to customers that hasn’t been brought there before? I’m just trying to get a better understanding of sort of like the opportunity here. And along those lines, like do you need a broader molecular biology portfolio to continue to drive into that market? Thank you. Yes, happy to do that, Derik. So I want to make some initial comments and Jacob is knee deep into this business, and he can share with you some of the things that really differentiate ourselves here. So, I think we first got started down this journey with the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. We really felt that was a really good first point with a differentiated offering with novel, unique technology that nobody had. But we also felt that we needed to have some more scale to be much more formal in the space. After the recent acquisition of ACEA Biosciences and the acquisition of BioTek, the $250 million-plus, we think we’ve got the scale. And we’re also very selective in terms of the types of companies we look at, the teams, the profile of the portfolio, so I think we’ve got something really especially that it differentiated. And Jacob, why don’t you talk about what we’re doing about the workflows and some other things? Yes, absolutely. So I’m certainly excited about our opportunity in the cell analysis space. And what I think is that two dynamics going on. First of all, with the recent rise of immune-oncology that we first play out in [indiscernible] now in the cell analysis also. And then, of course, generally speaking, immunology, that there’s a lot of interest in that space right now. And it really requires technologies that allow for life cell analysis, both from an imaging perspective, but also measuring the activity in the life cells. And those are the technologies that we’re providing between the BioTek, the Seahorse, the ACEA and the lots of technologies. So where we really differentiate is, first of all, the seahorse and ACEA Technologies are very differentiated understanding on their own, while BioTek have a very broad portfolio, including some very excited imaging technologies. But we have not bring them together in workflow settings, where you can use basically the multi techniques to look at cell from many different angles and provide much deeper insight based on one informatics platform that nobody else can do in the market. So that I think that’s really where we differentiate versus competition. And one of the things, Derik, we looked at was, we had already been working, for example, between the BioTek team and the CRS team actually have been working together prior to the acquisition. And we had proof points based on incremental business we had, which was customers really didn’t want to have independent instrumentation and data systems that really haven’t integrated software, integrating these workflows and really was – really had a differentiated value to customers, and they saw that was very important to them and they were willing to give us the business as a result. First question is Mike and Bob, you guys have touched on China several times already. But maybe we can talk a little bit about assumptions concerning other geographies in 2020? Are they any different than what you’re currently seeing in terms of both current business, as well as wall to your order book? Thanks. Yes, yes. No, that’s a great question, Bill. So let me kind of walk you through kind of how we’re thinking about the various markets. So we would expect that the Americas would continue to kind of lead the pace with kind of high single-digit growth. Europe, probably low single-digit growth going forward, pretty consistent with kind of how we’ve seen this year kind of play out. And the rest of Asia, excluding China being in kind of in that low to mid single-digit growth. And so that’s kind of how we’re thinking about China. And China would be low to mid, yes. Got it. And then, Mike, to elaborate on an earlier comment that you made about tighter capital, can you just talk about how broadly you’re seeing that? Oh, I think that comment was related to conditions we saw in 2019, that – and my comment really was, even when there’s tighter capital, which is what we saw with lower PMIs throughout this year, customers are still willing to invest when you have a solution that helps them with their bottom line, their productivity, as well as their scientific results. So what I’m saying is, there’s a path forward to getting more business, even when capital is tight. Okay. So you’re not suggesting obviously then that there’s some sort of lack of availability, it really has to do with, if you have the right product, you can find it? …the – your position in biopharma, specifically a large molecule is what portion do you think of the business today? And where would you like that to be, I guess, would be a good color? Thank you. Yes, happy to do so, Paul. And as Bob mentioned, we’ve been having – we have strong pharma results, again, this quarter. This has been kind of consistent story for Agilent over the last several years. During that period of time, we’ve been consistently growing our biopharma portion, our large molecule portion of that business double-digit. I think, a couple years ago was probably maybe about 15% of our pharma business. Now it’s up to probably north of 20% and we think that rate will continue. It’s not because the other side has been shrinking, it’s because we think we’ve been obviously investing very heavily, either through new instrument platforms, marked on some acquisitions in this area. So while we don’t have a specific percentage in mind, I would expect every time I start talking you through the coming years, you’re going to see a higher part of the – of our business in biopharma. In fact, when we come out to – at the conference again this year, we’ll probably talk more specifically about the entirety of our biopharma business. I dropped a lot of comments today about NASD and some cell analysis. So a lot of stuff ultimately comes in into a lot of us into the biopharma end market. We often think about biopharma business just being associated with LC and LCMS, but there’s a lot more to the story. Okay. And on the academic side, it was soft. What was specifically did do you see going on in the U.S. market in the quarter? We dug into this, honestly, it’s probably worth calling. And as best we can see really was just about the strength of the business we had last year, I think it was about over 10% growth last year. So nothing really is really changing in that environment and continue to see very solid and stable funding environment. Sometimes there’s seasonality a bit with that business, but I think that’s really all we could really saw them. That’s right. I mean, that business is one of our smaller businesses, and it can be kind of lumpy and so forth and had a very strong Q4. So this appears to be another quarter of growth in CrossLab. So wondering what continues to be the strength there. What’s your confidence there longer-term? And it’s consistently about 8% growth for the – I mean, now, last three years. And so should we expect similar expectation here going forward into – and despite LSAG instruments being flat for the year, as you pointed out in your remarks, should we expect CrossLab’s longer-term to continue to do well, knowing that some of the instrumentation is being flat and with the consumables and service contracts will continue to grow? I’m happy to comment on this. This is a real success story, I think of the new ads and we architect this strategy a couple of years ago. And we – I can recall, getting this question almost every year when we had an 8% or 9% print, hey, when’s it going to end? And we would say, it’s not going to end. We think that what’s going on here is really you have changing customer needs and you need to anticipate what’s going to happen and provide a new set of services and capabilities. really help them with the economics on the lab in addition to the scientific results. So today, I think this – and I hope it came through in the call script, which was we said, we really have demonstrated this new business model this year, where we can have strong growth in ACG, irrespective of whether or not the business in our new instrument side is as strong as we’d like it to be. So, as Bob said, the guide for next year, we’re quite confident in our ability to continue this high single-digit kind of growth. The services proposition we have and what we offer is really what we’re resonating with customers. You heard, Jacob commenting a little bit on some of the work that goes on between Mark’s team and Jacob’s team to develop new capabilities around our instrument platforms, which leads into a set of new revenue streams on our services side. And on the consumer side, it’s been both a story of organic growth, but also continuing to add more to the portfolio through acquisitions. So I think we’re really quite confident about our ability to continue this high single-digit growth rate really tied in also to how we’re enabling business differently on a digital perspective. So I hope it’s coming through that we’re highly confident about our – what we build and where this business is going to go in the future. …just one other thing is, we’re talking about this. If you looked at just the attach rates, we’ve got a number of programs that are driving increased attach rates. We have – we think we have a lot of room to continue to grow there. And I think the one thing that we’ve seen this year is actually, as Mark and team have offered more services and more solutions, we’re actually seeing for the instruments that we are placing actually higher value… ...tied to the service offerings. So we’re actually being able to create more value on a per box basis, given the portfolio that we’ve been able to derive. So there’s a lot of opportunity there. Jacob talked about some of the smart alerts and so forth, but we’re building this intelligence in. But in addition, we’re actually creating more value when an instrument is sold and actually increasing the service component. Okay, thanks. And if I could check on Dako, could you elaborate the contribution there on the quarter? I don’t know if you provided that and what’s your expectation that you’re breaking there for 2020? Yes. I think we didn’t provide a specific number for me. But if you saw my comments, we talked about gaining market share in pathology and we’ve got a high single-digit growing business in DGG. And though a lot of today’s call has been focused on the growth rate from NASD. Pathology is the largest business in that group and it’s doing well. Okay. And if I could squeeze in the last question on, Mike. When we look at the last couple of years, pulling back a little bit higher level. In terms of instrument launches, you had Intuvo, Ultivo, 8800 series, a number of launches. And this would be about the time we would be seeing a benefit from those. So is the message here that those instruments continue to gain strong traction in the market? And it’s just the end markets that are sort of challenging you and the government dynamics in China, or is there any – anything more to that we should be looking into in terms of the instrumentation? And just give us, if you could take a moment and give us a sort of a view into the new instrument sort of outlook longer-term and how should we think about Agilent in that framework? Thank you. Thanks, Puneet. I couldn’t have said it better myself, which is our product portfolio has never been stronger. We have had a continuing cadence of products, whether it’d be liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, LCMS, GCMS, molecular spectroscopy, the story just continues. So if there has been any softness relative to expectations in LSAG results, it’s all been some of the market environment conditions that you’ve described. And the fact that we’ve been able to continue to invest. We have invested in our field team, as well as I know, some of my competitors are pulling back their reins a bit, where we think we’re capturing share, we think we’re well positioned for – when some of these end markets start to turn to back to back to growth. We’ve seen some of these cycles before in the past. So I think the – and then I made a comment in my script about the product pipeline being full, which is what that was an indication of it. We have other projects. So we’re not going to introduce a bunch of instruments and then disappear for half a decade, you’re going to have a continuing cadence of products, new products, upgrades. So we feel like our NPI process is really humming right now. Hey, so I can’t believe I got this far in the call. But I wanted to ask how is the early integration of the BioTek acquisition going? And maybe can you also elaborate on the pacing of the revenue contribution? When I look at the fourth quarter, the acquired growth was about a point better than I was looking for in terms of the incremental growth and the first quarter is about a point shy of what I was looking for, was there any movement there? I’ll take the last one and then I’ll turn it over to Jacob for the integration piece. So yes, we – in simple terms, we had talked about $20 million to $25 million worth of revenue. It was slightly better – it was better than that in the quarter. Going into Q1, the ACEA Biosciences acquisition moves into core. So that’s why it looks a little lower. It shows up as part of our core growth. In Q4, both ACEA and BioTek were in the M&A number. And as I mentioned in my script, we’re very pleased with how the – we are on the early days in BioTek and Jacob, maybe just want to add a few comments. We just – we’ve had a big meeting with the field team few weeks ago, so… Yes, exactly. I think the integration couldn’t have been better so far. I think we are really spending time on learning, of course, BioTek and they spend time learning us both from what processes we’re using, but also from a cultural perspective, we continue to be very excited about the team that we’re getting on board and how they fit well with the Agilent culture. So I’m very excited. Obviously, over the next year, we’re going to integrate them. But – and – but I’m continuing to see a lot of momentum in the combined cell analysis business. Okay, thank you. I was talking to myself for a second. Just follow-up I was hoping if you could give us a mark-to-market on Lasergen, I think you’re expecting first placements in the second-half of this year at the last Analyst Day. Just how is the progress going there? Yes. So technically, Sam, I think we’ve really been quite pleased with the progress and we’re not ready to call out intro date for the RUO unit yet? That’s right, Mike. We are making good technical progress in terms of the specifications that are pushing technology. And we are executing on our development roadmap and we’re not ready to share specifics on the launch date just yet. I would say, Jack, this is Bob. Our guidance doesn’t comprehend any revenue there. And even back in the original guidance, there was no material revenue in 2020. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Agilent Technologies Q3 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.

Thank you for joining us on today’s call. I will start with a summary of our Q3 performance. Then I’ll move to an update and outlook on operating margin expansion and capital deployment plans. Finally, I will close with our full-year guidance. I am very pleased to report our Q3 results, with the Agilent team delivering revenue at the high-end of our guidance and earnings above our guidance range. Agilent’s Q3 revenue of $1.01 billion grew 1% over a year ago, up 9% on a core basis. Orders of $953 million, while down 6% compared to a year ago, were up 3% on a core basis. Our strong revenue growth was driven by continued strength in the pharma, diagnostics, environmental and forensics markets, and across all geographies. We saw strong customer acceptance of our new instrument product introductions, and strength in our CrossLab services and consumables, diagnostics and genomics offerings. We also resolved previous start-up issues in our Americas Logistics Center, which delayed $15 million of shipments last quarter. A few additional comments on the order front, our 3% core growth was against a tough compare of 9% growth in Q3 ’14. We also experienced some U.S. and state government big deal delays into Q4, and customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in like a weak -- in light of weak commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economies. Adjusted operating margin, including the adjustment for Keysight billings, was 19.9%, expanding 110 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.44. This marks another quarter of significant year-over-year margin improvements, driven by our intense focus on growing our operating margin, as we seek to achieve 22% margins by fiscal 2017. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent’s analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth of 9% was driven by strong performance in Pharma, environmental and forensics markets. Core orders were down 1%. LSAG operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. The previously announced exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. We expect our LSAG sales funnels to continue to strengthen, given a number of recent significant new product introductions. At June’s HPLC 2015 Conference in Geneva, we further enhanced our new Infinity II LC line with the new 1290 Infinity II Vial-Sampler. This product significantly lowers the entry price to the top-line product range, offering analytical laboratories a cost-effective way to experience the advantages of ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography. We released the 6470 LC/MS Triple-Quad at ASMS in June. This newly engineered core platform provides attogram-level sensitivity, and accurate quantitation with up to six orders of linear dynamic range. The new product delivers significant improvements to the best-selling core LC/MS Triple-Quad, the 6460. It offers improved performance, precision, speed and robustness; and features a small footprint to preserve bench space in the lab. And in spectroscopy, the 7800 quadrupole ICP-MS, which we launched in Q2, is the latest addition to Agilent’s industry-leading ICP-MS portfolio. This new product raises the standard for routine elemental analysis. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables businesses under a new Agilent brand. Core revenues were up 8%, while core orders grew 6% in the quarter. Operating margin was 22.6%. Last quarter, we launched the Agilent CrossLab Brand Promise program. This program is focused on delivering a new and integrated approach that offers actionable insights to help customers. New service solutions include laboratory business intelligence reporting, RFID inventory management services, and laboratory asset utilization services. And in consumables, we expanded our AdvanceBio portfolio of solutions, which enables scientists to speed research and lower costs. Finally, turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions: the former Dako business, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions. DGG’s results were driven by excellent performance across all three divisions, pathology and companion diagnostics, genomics and nucleic acid businesses. DGG’s core revenue grew 10% versus a year ago. Orders grew 8% on a core basis. Operating margin of 16.8% was up 330 basis points over Q3 of fiscal year 2014. In the third quarter, DGG completed its acquisition of Cartagenia, a leading provider of software for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. We launched updated Gene Expression Microarray tools for researchers to better investigate expression patterns on a highly accessible platform. Adding to products for next generation sequencing, we released new Target-Enrichment Solutions for disease research, which will address current limitations in exome sequencing. Now, let’s take a brief look at Agilent’s revenue by end market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continued to see strength in pharma, a recovery with strong demand in the diagnostics and clinical market, and moderate growth in academia and government. Applied end-market performance was led by continued spending in environmental and forensics, and moderate growth in food. Chemical and energy was flat, due to reduced investments in oil exploration. We also saw cautious spending in downstream refining and chemical segments, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty concerns. Geographically, we saw healthy core revenue growth across all regions, particularly in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, with strong growth in China. Major pharma spending was brisk, with large firms upgrading to the new Infinity LC platform. Turning from the report out of Agilent’s revenue and order results, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q3 capital deployment actions and outlook. Thanks to those of you on the call who joined us at our May Analyst and Investor Meeting. As a reminder, I highlighted three focus areas where we are working as a team to drive shareholder value: deliver above-market revenue growth, expand operating margins to historic highs and return 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. I’ve just discussed our revenue growth. Now here’s an update on our operating margin and capital deployment. Our multi-year “Agile Agilent” program is re-engineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. As of the third fiscal quarter, we have delivered $35 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We are committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY ‘17, a three point improvement over FY ‘14, while continuing to invest for long-term revenue growth. With the margin improvement results over the past two quarters, we are very confident in our ability to deliver on our margin expansion goals. Now turning to capital deployment. As previously guided, we are on track to return $500 million this year to shareholders in the form of dividends and buy backs. In Q3, we repurchased $99 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $267 million. With respect to guidance, we are reaffirming our previous FY 2015 EPS guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, as the operating model of the new Agilent continues to drive profitable growth and margin expansion. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional details on our guidance and financial results. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures were respectively 3% and 9%. This quarter, currency subtracted 6.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. And as Mike stated, start-up issues with the transfer of U.S. distribution center were resolved in Q3, which resulted in about $15 million of additional revenue. Finally, adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, 160 basis points higher than our guidance and 110 basis points higher than last year on just 0.5% higher nominal revenues. Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Agilent/Keysight split, operating margin grew 210 basis points. I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.49. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.7% on a core basis and our 20.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 40 basis points sequentially. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program with planned purchases of $98 million in Q4. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.6% on a core basis, again, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures. Fiscal year \\'15 revenue guidance is $37 million lower than previous guidance, of which $15 million is due to currency. Our EPS guidance of $1.70 at midpoint is unchanged from previous guidance, due to additional Agile Agilent savings that compensated for slightly lower revenues. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 19.2% or 40 basis points higher than last year. Excluding the impact of the $40 million cost dis-synergies related to the Agilent/Keysight split, our operating margin will be 140 basis points over previous year, on flat reported revenue growth. Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your book-to-bill. I think I’m calculating a 0.94, which is the lowest you’ve had in years. So I wonder if there\\'s any additional color to be offered there. Yes. I’m looking at Didier in the conference room here. I think that number is correct. And we had very, very strong Q3 revenue. And as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to have our growth rate pick up as we have -- are expecting a number of areas of strength in the marketplace, such as pharma, the diagnostics, the environmental forensic space that I talked about earlier continue to be quite strong. And we\\'ve had a lot of new product introductions. Our sales funnels are building. And we’ve seen really strong win loss ratios of that new business. And sometimes orders can be a little bit lumpy. So we do see some big deals moving between quarters, which we saw here in the third quarter on the state and federal level in United States. And I would just also point out we had a tough compare when we look at kind of the results for the third quarter. No absolutely, not. I think we have a lot of reasons to be positive about the outlook. And other thing I did not mention, Dan, was that, we got off to a slow start in the third quarter in incoming orders after finishing so strong in Q2. But throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration of incoming orders throughout the quarter and finished the quarter strong. Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, would be interested in getting some more granularity on just how China performed in the period, how the book-to-bill ended there? And what you perceive the implications of the currency revaluation are to your profitability there? And just remind us whether you price in local currency or in USD? Yes. Sure. I mean, great question. I figure we\\'d probably spend some time today talking about China, given some of the recent news. But in terms of our performance in China in the third quarter, we have very strong revenue growth with low-double digits. And we’re tracking through the first three quarters right on the plans. We\\'ve talked about with all of you at the analyst meeting the high-single digit level of growth in China. In terms of the areas of strength, we’re continuing to see strength in pharma, life science, research, the diagnostics, food, environmental. And the business really continues to develop as we had expected, albeit some of the recent changes, which in terms of how that affects our profitability in China, it\\'s really neutral. We’re naturally hedged in China in terms of both the amount of revenues that we bring in, in China. Even though it is our second largest country in terms of revenue, we also have a very large footprint there, including local manufacturing. So we are naturally hedged in China. And in terms of your question around the mix of RMB versus dollars, about 20% of our business is in RMB and about 80% is in dollars. And in terms of the overall business, just maybe one final comment here on China, we can dig into other areas of China if you like. But when we look at the devaluation, we’re not really expecting to have that significant of an impact on the business in China itself. And then it depends also how you view to actually be successful and drive some more growth there. I think the better question is, what could it mean to the economies and currency in some of the emerging markets? But hopefully I answered your question. If not, come back with another one. Yes. That’s helpful. And then just one question on the chemical and energy markets. Could you give us any color around what the order trends are like there and whether you’re seeing any signs of stability I guess in the sort of energy-related end market if at all? Yes. Great question. So we have seen stability, although it’s not where we hope to see coming into this year. So we’re now three quarters in a row of basically flat business in chemical and energy. And I think it\\'s no surprise that the exploration side of that business is down fairly significantly. And we had anticipated that. And just to remind you of an exploration side, our business account for about 15% of this total segment. We are seeing growth in the downstream, chemical and refining process but not to degree that we had hoped to see early this year. So basically we get -- it’s grown enough to offset the downward pressure on the exploration side. Again that segment of the market is very profitable, but they seem to be still cautious on their spending. As you may recall from the analyst meeting we talked to you about our view that this was a 2% to 4% market growth segment and we still see it that way, but we’re just being cautious in our Q4 outlook in this segment right now. We do think it’s stabilizing. We got three quarters in a row of basically flat business in this segment for us. So I guess I want to go back to Dan\\'s question. I mean, it was a pretty solid quarter, but again that book-to-bill of 0.94 was arguably notably light. And the revenue number while solid, it wasn\\'t Herculean feat. So it is helpful to hear the commentary on momentum building over the course of the quarter. That said, even recognizing the commentary in the slight reduction to guidance, the Q4 bar is still pretty high. You did lower guidance, albeit by only about $20 million, excluding FX. You could have chosen to cut more. Is it fair to say that if you saw any change in ordering patterns in the early part of this quarter, in particular those attributable -- now basically those customers that are more exposed to macroeconomic concerns that you probably would have cut guidance more? Yes, Doug. Thanks for the question. And if I may humbly disagree in terms of the comments that revenue actually were quite pleased with being able to put those types of revenue numbers. But I think you’re on the right path. And question here, which is 3% constant currency order growth, what kind of converse do we have going forward? Clearly, if we have seen some of those patterns, I mean we’re having that call here today. We would reflect it in our guidance. And we have reason to be positive about the outlook. If you look at the business by our three groups, our ACG and DGG business have momentum. It’s a recurring revenue business. That business is tracking very nicely. We talked to you about -- I am actually going to ask Patrick to jump in and provide his perspective and as well. I think the obvious question is what’s the outlook for LSAG? And I think we’re one of the few companies out in the space that reports orders. So I think sometimes they get caught in these stories of lumpiness between quarters. When we look at our business here, we respect pharma, biopharma, diagnostics, clinical diagnostics, environment space to remain strong. China is on a steady trajectory, no expected hiccups there. And we just had a number of new product introductions and we’re coming off with tough year, yearly compare and a really strong Q2. So Patrick, I don’t know if you have anything else you would like to add to my comments? Sure, Mike. Thanks. Yes, of course I kind of want to restate that you said here we had. In terms of your order pattern, order for LSAG, we had a slower start based on the very, very strong Q2. We had an also tough compare against last year where several of our big platforms have been 20% plus growth. Having said that, the pattern over Q3 was definitely accelerating through -- positively accelerating through Q3. And as you stated, the outlook for Q4 is positive. We see strong positive momentum in pharma where we have seen strong double-digit growth and we have no belief that momentum will slow down over the next couple of quarters. So given the confidence in our new platforms, which have been very well received, LCMS, and also latest introduction on the ICP-MS front, we are confident that we can deliver more plan for Q4. Okay. Thanks, Mike and Patrick. That’s all real helpful. And one quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this. The $30 million in revenue delayed from Q2 and the Q3 or at least that you talked about on the Q2 call, does that fully come through this quarter or will some of that potentially come through in Q4? Yes. Back in Q2, we talked about the $30 million of being two parts. One part is the $15 million that was a clear miss from the change in the logistic center and we recovered that fully into Q3. The second part is about more of the new normal. What it means is that we have orders coming in later in the quarter and shipment terms being slightly extended versus what we’re used to. And this is really the new normal. So there was no recovery of that second $15 million and we don’t expect it to either to -- I mean, we expect the new normal to be with us for quite sometime. Hey. Thanks. I understand the forward looking commentary here, but I just, think about the quarter on LSAG? Can you actually talk about what drove the 1% decline in core order growth? Where were you most surprise, I guess, relative to your own expectations? Thanks, Tycho. This is Mike. I am going to make a few comments and then, Patrick, I think, the question was the 1% order growth, where were the areas that we might have been surprise on. What I will do is, I will lead off and actually the order results for the quarter matched our own internal forecast. So we\\'re really weren’t surprised, business developed as we had anticipated. And I think, maybe just kind of emphasizing a few comments would be, we saw some deal push-outs on the U.S. and state governments side, saw some continued flat levels of growth in the Chemical and Energy space. But just few other comments you like to add there, Patrick? Sure, Mike. And the biggest surprise certainly for us was in the U.S. as you said, because we have seen the impact of both on the oil and chemistry side and a couple of delayed orders. On the positive side, Europe held up very nicely, as well as China was strong in growth. So in terms of platform to platform that have been affected most by the large delays, for example, LCMS, which had very tough compare compared to last year, where we had as we said plus 20% growth… And then, on DGG, 8% core growth is kind of at the high-end where you’ve talked about for market growth? Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of trends and whether there is a little bit of catch up effect here now around the [omnesys] [ph]. Yeah. You are right, I mean, if you look into, I mean, that’s why we have seen a very nice quarter here also with great growth and now see orders coming in at 8%. I do believe that we are on a good traction right now. We are continued to see great performance from the DGG. But you\\'re also right that it did little bit above what I’ve guided in our Analyst Day and clearly, we are also moving through a few quarters here, where we last year had some back order issues in the pathology business there, somewhat is an easy compare, but underlying the momentum is definitely here. Good. On the DGG Group, are the CMS guidelines that were released late in the year, so you where, I guess, implying is it, are those new guidelines helping DGG business and is it kind of more momentum from that occurring right now within that group? Oh! I am sorry, on the center for Medicare or Medicaid services. They put out the new rules in October last year? Yeah. Thanks for that question. Actually, those rules are not really covering the -- our particularly business -- the pathology business and that sits outside the pathology business, so we don’t -- we didn\\'t see any change to that and overall the pathology market continues to be healthy. So we have not been impacted by those changes in guidelines and I don\\'t expect that we will see any changes in our performance due to those guidelines going forward either. Yes. I mean, we are -- we definitely continue to see that the on this momentum installation is improving. As I have also mentioned earlier, there is sales cycle that are more than few months or maybe even few quarters. So we are still building momentum, but we continue seeing and also an improvement in taking back market share and win competitive accounts. So I am pretty optimistic around that the future also in pathology business. And then lastly, Mike, on the NMR closure, are you now in the peak of cost savings there or is it part of the reason you\\'re seeing improving margins going forward? Yeah. We are well above our run rate of cost savings, I would say, we say that initially we were actually for $50 million per year now it’s a $20 million and we are getting to pretty much our run rate there. The one thing I will signal is that, we are -- next year we still we will have about $11 million of revenue that will show on the RPD front and for the first three quarters as we make the last installations and then recognize revenue, so that will be about $50 million reduction from this year and but we will continue showing our orders and revenue on a core basis, excluding NMR so that we are comparing apple-to-apple. Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just want to circle back to an earlier topic in the Q&A, specifically regarding the impact of new products this year in the business? Could you maybe offer like a full-year expectation for contribution from new products to topline? How if I pass it over to Patrick and talk about some of the new offerings in the instruments side and Jacob and Mark you comment on your groups and then I will close with answer to your question, Isaac. Definitely last few years, so this is Patrick speaking. So when you look at our new product offering this year and there is a series new products we launched, let me start with the LC business where the, actually, end of last year, startup of the Infinity II LC launch and we added this year actually at the HPLC Meeting another set of products to it that is driving definitely a lot of market share gains for us so far this year. In Q3 we had growth in orders and in revenues. We had double-digit growth on this platform driven by strong acceptance in many markets, mainly in the pharmaceutical markets where we see larger enterprises, as well as more companies making replacement and buy some new instruments, because this has -- platform has such a strong offering. Then on LC/MS we just launched the new 6470 Triple Quad system which will overtime replace our very solid performing 6460 Quad platform, again very strong interest after ASMS introduction and there is more to come during the year. So the contribution for product we don’t disclose the actual percentage, but it drives a lot of new business for us and a lot of attention in the market. Yes. Yeah. I will just give you an example from the spectroscopy, thanks Mike. So we launched the ICP-MS solution 7800 and on the OES side as we introduced a year ago the IC -- 5100 ICP-OES system that just an example of how we kept about 7 points in market share over 15 months based on this highly differentiated platform. So it’s really one of the means for us to capture market share and drive growth. It will make significant contribution. I think, Mark, I made a few comments in the call script about some of the recent offerings, but maybe just a few highlights for Isaac on the ACG side. On the ACG side, as Mike alluded to you in his earlier comments, obviously, it’s a key driver of our ongoing growth too. So specifically for this quarter on the enterprise side a trio of services that are largely around our asset management area and also include in the advanced bio area. So it’s hard to put an exact percentage on it, but obviously, we are putting a lot of effort behind growing what we see the differentiated side of our portfolio in consumables and services and putting R&D and marketing budgets behind that. I would also add based on the Patrick\\'s comments, when you introduce new platform it is also a great opportunity to introduce new services and consumables around that and to that end we, obviously, have chance to augment introduction whether it’s consulting services or consumables that put a whole platform. So when you tie all together there is some nice synergies between what goes on from the LSAG side, the DGG side, and obviously, our ACG team. All right. Thanks and thanks Isaac for asking the question, I am -- as you can hear, we can definitely talk long time about all the new exciting products. But I will just remind you that that we have a few different dynamics going on in my business. First of all, with the pathology and diagnostics businesses and we are in partnership. This is not about bring out new product everyday, but they have -- you want to install your new instrument into the account and then get the contract and then run the rate and the new products we actually bring out there is new assay that goes on top of that. So you, of course, have a different lifecycle of the products that we have in chemical market compared to maybe in the genomics research market where we come up with some existing products also, the HaloPlex HS which actually address very low concentration of sequencing information, the [indiscernible] exome improvement also and Gene Expression arrays. Those have shorter lifetime and we see a higher percentage of our sales from this year and into next year from those products. And why they made us put a bow on this discussion, but we talk a lot about the portfolio, but I would be remiss that to remind you of the channel change you made this year. So, we’re also -- we simplified our cell structure and it’s going to allow us to invest in buildout coverage. So I think you’re going to see our growth being fueled going forward not only on the strength of the new portfolio but also the expanded channel reach and specialization, we’ve been investing in. And this is a note through the first three quarters. I think our quarter revenues were over 6% and we’re on track for our strongest revenue growth in several years. I think probably a point greater than any other growth rates we’ve put up in the last three years. But again if I could just leave that with you on the combination of both the new product offerings but also our change in channel strategy as well. All right. Hey guys, I really appreciate all the detail. I don’t want to sound too ungrateful but on that 6% number year-to-date, how much of it was on those new products? We don\\'t know. We don’t -- we don\\'t have that number that we\\'ve shared externally but it’s been a contributor. All I can say is significant contributor. I think everyone is obviously trying to get a handle on what’s going on in the economy there. It seems to me maybe a simple way to break it up will be to delineate the percentage of your business in China that is maybe funded by sort of federal and in government sort of associated entities versus products that might be tied more to discretionary CapEx. Do you have a way to maybe break it down between those two buckets within, just sort of, I think, within China 17% of sales, maybe between those two end markets, how would you split it? No. Not at the company level, I mean, information, it’s probably tracked by some of our people. But I’m not collecting it and aggregating it. What I can share with you is because we’ve been kind of nosing around on this question ourselves internally. And the areas of strength particularly the Pharma area is a lot of private sector money. So traditionally this market has been heavily dominated by the direct investment by the government. We’re seeing a move. I think it’s still the majority but we are seeing a lot more business coming from private funded enterprises, particularly as the Chinese government also is moving a lot of its testing outside of government testing labs, for example, the food area where there\\'s now whole new set of private testing labs that are -- they are coming online in the country. Yeah. The other complexity we are even trying to attract that is for the companies that fewer Chinese companies that in their exporters versus the local -- I mean companies that can go after the local market, the exporters will benefit from the weakening yen. So it’s going to be that several layers of complexity, would we want to try to focus the overall impact of the weakening of the yen or the weakening of the Chinese GDP. Mike just -- hi Mike. Just following up on the China discussion, what\\'s your take at this point on where we are with the anti-corruption investigations? Is it your sense that we kind of fully turned the corner there or is it still little early to signal all clear on that? Yeah, Dan. Great question. I think it\\'s a new normal. I think this is -- the effort is here to stay. I think in terms of the changes where we talked about before of slowing deal velocity and a lot more conservatism in terms of the overall approval process. I think that sort of baked out now. So we’re no longer pointing to longer deal cycles in China as a result of anti-corruption. But I think the longer deal cycles are here to stay and now are now in this kind of this rhythm of really cautious approvals by the government authorities. And that\\'s why I mentioned earlier that a lot of the areas of growth particularly in the private sector where you’ve not seen the same bureaucratic approach to approvals of deals. I think this is the new normal. Got it. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then maybe just on LSAG, can you maybe comment on pricing in chromatography as we just sort of thinking about the new product introductions and then just the strong overall results across the space. Curious maybe to just get an updated view on how ASPs are trending relative to ….? Happy to take this one. So as you can imagine, every new product introduction gives the opportunity to also improve your gross margins and ASPs which we actually have seen. And there is actually for us, that’s one of the reasons why we’re also confident on delivering to the bottomline over the year. So we will continue to launch these new products because they are highly differentiated and give you an opportunity to drive ASP and we will keep ASP up which otherwise would erode overtime. I think it is fair to say Patrick particular to -- specific to the Japan business, it’s not a new phenomenon. But our competitors there who don’t have the same currency challenges that we do are using that to be very aggressive at times on pricing but we have the gross margin structure to be able to compete. Good afternoon guys. So Mike, obviously as you sort of embarked to CEO of the new Agilent, you put forth a lot of programs to sustain sort of the superior growth and improve the margin and the cash flow generation. If you think about the various things highlighted in the call, where do you feel like you sort of outperformed kind of timing expectations and you’ve seen maybe similarly signs of the benefits in the organization and where do you feel like you need to make the most progress? Thanks Ross. Appreciate the recognition of the kind comments. I think the area that I’m mostly done is the ability to get the margin improvements. I mean, we’re basically six months into the journey since I transitioned to the role from Bill. And I can see the momentum and our ability to get our margin structure to different place. I think you’ve heard reference in the number of times in our call today. And if you were inside the company, I think everybody knows the goal that we’re trying -- we\\'re shooting for. So I think that’s the area that I’m really -- obviously the growth, pleased with their ability to grow. And we always want more growth but we’re looking for -- we\\'re on pace to have our highest growth year since 2011. So -- and then I think there\\'s been a solid reaction to how we modified our approach to couple of deployment as well. Great. And again there seems to be just a little confusion sort of the order versus revenue pacing. Last quarter, obviously at the short fall, you build the backlog. It looked like $30 million you called out looked about right versus the last few years. In this quarter, it looked like you flushed around $60 million of backlog based on the differential versus orders. And then as we think about and again I realized most players in the industry don’t give a book to bill. It seems like your commentary is suggestive of your orders around track, which I guess would more imply we did see that backlog flush this quarter. And so I’m just trying to reconcile that versus Didier’s comment because I thought implied we didn’t get full all of the 30 back in some. I’m trying to reconcile the delta between what the backlog is showing and kind of what you actually saw in the business because in my mind you did about 1.01 book to bill over the two quarters. And again this is the CapEx business. So looking over a longer period is usually better. Yeah. Thanks for that clarifying question, Ross. I think what Didier was trying to point out, I think we talked about $15 million of business coming in. We couldn’t ship it to the Q3. So obviously that came through this quarter. But the view is we’ve probably got another 15 in which we’ll ship and which we didn’t ship this quarter. Did that answer the question, Ross? Yeah. But I guess, on the order rate side, the other point, it seems like that\\'s more of a function of timing and revenue recognition, any sort of underlying change in the tone of the business? No. I understand your question now, so -- and again, I think we saw a good quarter momentum through the quarter. And you’ll see some new movements between quarters lot of times which we saw between Q2, Q3 and Q4. But the overall …. I guess, when you look at your business, I think year-to-date, you guys are probably the fastest-growing life science company at least that we look at in terms of traditional analytical equipment. As you try to figure out in -- it\\'s tough comparing different companies, given different product and geographic exposure but where do you feel like you\\'re doing the best and is it really maybe -- how much of it sort of leveraged to biopharma which seems to be healthiest end market, which you guys have obviously done well in versus may be technology share or other elements, some of the other sub-sectors. We’re just -- it is just of perception here that maybe you guys are growing on average to me, I’m curious if it is to you. Looks like you’re actually probably the fastest growing. So, I’m just trying to bridge that gap. Our internal map would match your numbers or your view. Obviously, pharma, biopharma has been a key part of the growth story but it’s not the only part of the growth story. And I think it speaks to the breadth of our portfolio and businesses we are in so. As you know from -- you may recall from the analyst meeting, we talked at great length about our view of CrossLab services, consumable, informatics, how that was going to be an area of future growth outside of just the technology areas. And then you heard the DGG story already from Jacob and that’s a business that will continue to get momentum as we continue to put more and more of the [omnesys] [ph] out there. You start to close deals on the slides and then that starts to show up in revenue in the coming quarters. And then we haven’t talked about it today but Companion Diagnostics, we’ve been winning some deals there. So, I think it’s not only a story of end market strength in certain segments like pharma but also where we are playing in our view of lab-wide services and the momentum we have in our DDG business. And then finally, I think from a technology platform, it is very clear we are doing quite well in spectroscopy in the liquid phase and spectrometry areas. Quick question here. Just about the revenue guidance reductions, heard just about that. Just trying to understand, Didier, if I heard you correctly, of the $37 million reduction in the sales line, $15 million is FX. What is the remainder of the reduction, where is it coming from? The $22 million remainder is basically a reassessment of our view on the chemical and energy markets where we are seeing now that the downstream refining and chemical markets are not picking up as fast as we expected the benefits of the low cheaper feedstock. So probably considering the fact that there is some little bit of stickiness about the world economy, we are not seeing the pickup in those downstream markets that will offset the drop in our revenues in the exploration production. So, we were hoping for again a pickup there and it’s not happening. And our business overall is about flat. Okay. Excellent. And separately, let me ask you, the $15 million of revenue, the help that you had from the revolution of your logistics center issues, was there any impact on margin on the operating margin expansion there? Great question. So, Didier, correct me if I’ve got my math wrong here. But in terms of the topline, we got everything through. The shipments are back to normal. The customers experience is just fine. But we have seen cost overruns relative to our expectations as we work through the operational issues and I think it\\'s probably been to the tune of about $0.01 on Q3 on reported EPS. But besides that from the $15 million, it’s about kind of average, vouching for that piece although there is probably a little bit more of consumable for the little bit better operating margin at the average. But still that in itself, we had the operating leverage not much else. And then, this point that Mike was making that as we worked addressing the issues that we were facing logistics centers, we incurred close to $0.01 of additional cost in Q3. Yes. I just want to ask about some of commentary in the deck about the U.S. and state government deals getting pushed into 4Q. I was curios if you could give a little bit more commentary around that. And then just whether you thought any of the momentum in the academic and the market around and Congress around some improved funding, maybe that with impacting out there? I can take this one, yes. Thanks Mike. So what we have seen in the first half, you’ve heard all the comments, we actually had a pretty healthy business in this market segment. In Q3, we saw kind of a pause where we have seen several of our larger accounts, actually took a pause and reassessed the budget for the remainder of the year and just delayed several deals. So, we don’t see these deals lost and we really anticipate that we will see in academic, government section, especially in U.S. that picking up again in Q4 this year. Got it. Understood. And then, just one question on the gross margins in the CrossLab business. Just curious if you had any thoughts around the pricing dynamic there just given that the consumable piece of the business was doing quite well, I thought we might see a little bit more pull through on the gross margin line? Sure. And Jack, in terms of the year-to-year comparable, once again it’s apples to oranges on the CrossLab business. And next year, you will be in a great position to ask me because it will be an apples-to-apples compare between the two. But the vast majority of the synergies are the spin and we did invest money to obviously take care of some logistics issues. So as Mike talked about some of the impacted earnings per share, a lot of that came through on our business. So overall though, I don\\'t think we\\'ve seen near but frankly, we haven’t seen that much pressure on the ASPs at this point in time. Mike, I don’t know if you want to add any comments? Yeah. I think the ASPs, a really solid year and mainly and if you look at our prior year comparisons, it really been a story of the synergies and market picking up the load of the logistics center, cost overruns. And as you saw in our cost script, we are really investing heavily to bring out new chemistry products, which have some very nice margin structure associated with them. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I\\'ll start with one, a bit of a retrospective for Mike. It has to do with sales force strategy. Mike, your several number months now into this area where you have consolidated sales forces. When you make a decision to consolidate the sales force, introduces a number of different possibilities. One is that you can be more nimble going after opportunities. Number two is of course, there can be disruptions. Can you reflect on that process, what you\\'ve seen and to the extent if you can, can you share any progress on metrics around that process? Yeah. Great, great question. And in terms of the sales force changes as you pointed out, that was one of the first major changes we’ve made in the new Agilent. And I really think it\\'s allowed us to streamline our executive structure and we had a lot of well meaning managers but we spend a lot of time discussing things internally. And this allow us to actually move a lot faster as we really entered two business, the analytical lab marketplace across a number of end markets and then in the regulated diagnostics space in Jacob\\'s business. I\\'m very, very pleased with how the overall plan has gone. We have been very -- in terms of how we look at internally, we are ahead of our cost reduction goals. I think more importantly, we\\'re getting the growth and we\\'re getting the coverage. They want it to be able to invest to cover, make sure we can cover all the markets and invest in specialization where we needed. Now this is a multiyear program. So, I think this really I would say is the foundation year. And I think as you go into FY ‘16 and ’17, you start to get the full benefit of our ability to have really close account relationships backed up by very, very competent sales personnel. Thanks Mike. And then one for Jacob. I’m not sure if you gave it earlier but if you didn’t, would you mind giving us a growth rate for the Dako business? And it would be really helpful if you could comment on where you think we are in terms of the process of Dako, what inning if you will sort of using American sports analogy? Are we in with Dako in terms of getting back to full scale and our ability to grow the business quickly? And then sorry to keep piling on here. But if you wouldn\\'t mind, it sounds like just based on your tone and comments really that that business really is picking up. If you wouldn\\'t give us a bit of insight into the nuts and bolts of where it is you\\'re seeing the business pickup, is it equipment refreshes in the replacement cycle, is it more about competitor share gains, is it more about the instrumentation and the consumables that get run through the instruments? Any color there would be really helpful. Thanks again. All right, Steve. So, I will give you a little bit color without getting all the information about our underlying businesses here. But overall, the Dako businesses consist of few businesses. Two prime parts we have talked about is the pathology business and then our Companion Diagnostic business where the companion diagnostic is our partnering business with the pharma companies on developing new Companion Diagnostic within IHC and the FISH-based. And by the way, this is going very, very well and we will soon see the first significant launch of new Companion Diagnostic within a PLD-1 drug space. However, your questions around the pathology business and how we see that, I mean overall, we definitely see a good momentum. I will not say we are completely back in full scale yet. We did see some challenges last year on some back orders. We also have improved our performance on the Omnis over the last quarters, so we see actually all cylinders kick now. But it actually takes a few quarters to win deals in this space here. So, I would actually see continuous improvement over next few quarters. What we do see is that when we win deals, we of course win back. We win the deals that we -- in refresh of technology but we definitely also see a pickup in competitive deals as the Omnis solution is very competitive. And when you do that, when you put a new placement in, you will also get all the ranges running through that platform. So you place an instrument and then it takes another, maybe another quarter to get full loading of your consumables in there. So, I expect actually that we are in a good trajectory here. But the best remains to be seen also. Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So can we just kind of clarify some of the commentary that’s been given so far on the organic growth expectations? Given from what you’ve said on the past, the previous questions, it seems like the weaker book-to-bill in the third quarter could have been, due to some of the weakness in the energy and chemical markets and that kind of flows through into the fourth quarter, or is it a function of something else? I guess when it comes down to, it doesn’t make -- it isn\\'t completely apparent in terms of how the delayed orders would necessarily adversely affect the book-to-bill, but then there would be an ultimate catch-up to that? So, I guess, could you just kind of help us walk through, are the expectations purely oil and gas or is there something else in there that we need to think about for the fourth quarter specifically? Sure. Dane, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some of the earlier comments. I think the relative to what we reporting to in our U.S. government side of the business, that a situation where normally we face on last year’s deal activity, we had Q3 business last year and what we saw was, as Patrick mentioned, that business is going to go from Q3 to Q4. So that’s one of the reasons why you had a drop in the book-to-bill. I think as we mentioned earlier too, we started off slow in the third quarter coming off a very strong close to Q2. We start off flow in May. We saw the pace of orders we just didn’t chance to close all the business in the third quarter. I really wouldn’t point to the chemical and energy beyond the fact that its just a continuation of what we have been seeing, which is basically no growth, three quarters in a row and I’m not going to call a recovery like I done earlier this year. So we’re just remained cautious on the implied industrial market both, the chemical and energy, as well as mining sector of our business. And then, if you -- one more question on China, I know you guys have answered a lot of them color. Generally, at the end of these five-year plans there is somewhat of a spending flush. Is that -- it doesn\\'t seem like many people contemplated that. Is that something guys have thought about or given the state of things over there? It would be too aggressive to hope for something to occur like that? Yeah. I think great question again. We’ve taken a fairly conservative view on that, if it happens great, but we’re not counting on that, because there is lot of changes recently under the new leadership in terms of how they conduct their business. So, again, if it would happen, wonderful news for the industry, but we\\'re not counting on them in our go-forward forecast. Okay. Great. And one last one for me on the gross margin line, the current guidance does seem like we get above that 54% in the fourth quarter? Is that something that you guys feel confident, we’ll see given where the FX rates and the composition of the product mix that we would expect there or should we kind of alter expectations where the operating margin uptick comes from? Yeah. We don’t usually provide guidance on the gross margin level. But yes, we\\'re expecting a slight improvement in gross margin sequentially between Q3 and Q4. That’s typically where we that kind of pattern we see historically as particularly in the services side as we finish out the year. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. Sorry about that. I was on mute. Couple of question. So is your fourth quarter guidance dependent upon any large changed orders in the government? Great. So I think there is some concern the commodity prices need to fall, there is some concern the commodity prices may continue to fall. So if you do have -- if we given it like 5% to 10% decline in current level commodity price, how does that impact [Technical Difficulty] I think we’ve been carrying this free fall of commodity prices for some time. So our view is that if we continue to see downward pressure, I think it would push out your return to growth in this segment but the business is pretty subdued there already. Patrick, I don’t know if you have anything, you’d add to that. Yeah. I mean what we discussed beginning of this year was that we actually could see some upside, which flow of feedstock prices, which didn’t kick in so far but which would be a fundamental underlying economical drive if the feedstock price could go further down. So I would say we are on the exploration side. We’re definitely not further exposed than we are already today. Yeah. On one hand we’re losing, on the other hand we saw economies with larger importers of commodities whether its oil or others, it’s a big plus, China, India, Japan so. Great. And just one final question, can you sort of remind us on your manufacturing footprint what you do in China versus Malaysia? And I guess the question -- on the basis of that question, I think there is some concerns that there could be some currency devaluation on some of the other countries and I think people were -- I\\'m getting some questions from investors about company exposure. Yeah. Great question. So if you look at what we call strategic manufacturing side, so we’re fairly diversified globally but we have two major sites in Asia. One is in China for our gas chromatography, which is a major product line for us. And then in Penang, Malaysia, we have all of our spectroscopy atomic and molecular spectroscopy, as well as some of our vacuum products and some of the DGG products. So they are two major sites for us. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Okay. I think our European outside of the currency offset, I mean the business there has been a really nice story for us this year and I point to Patrick. But I think we\\'re seeing no real significant changes there. The one part of the European business that we’re keeping a close eye on is really some of the emerging economies in Africa and the Middle East, how that could play out, but Western Europe has been pretty good for us. It has been very good. In terms of end markets, pharma has been definitely very strong story. We have seen flat to healthy business in the range of life science research overall. There is actually some upside potential there with we noticed to spending of the [EZB] [ph] that should also materialize in research over time. So for us the European market although has held up very nicely and we have been positively surprised over several quarters now by the local currency growth we have seen in Europe. And it hasn’t been just a story on the instrumentation side, we’ve really -- the customers really have responded to this CrossLab promise that the Mark’s team has put together. There is a lot of big wins on the service side in particular and then you heard already what’s been going on in the Dako and DDG business. All right. Thank you. And one more question from me. I guess probably for Mike, how do you feel about the overall visibility in the business? You may be ignoring backlog metrics specifically and how has that changed over the past 6 to 12 months? All right. Great. You broke up a bit. I think what we\\'ve seen is the visibility is pretty good out a quarter or so and this is a reminder. We book orders. We don’t book any orders unless they can be delivered in six months. So I think our visibility of a three to six kind of months\\' timeframe is pretty solid because we got the funnel. And course we have deal funnels that we track that have longer deal cycles. So we have a pretty confident view three to six months out and a kind of a longer-term view beyond that through our sales funnel metrics. I would say though that and this is the point that Didier made earlier that we are seeing more and more of the business come late in the quarter. And rather than hoping for a change in historical and to this pattern, we now made this our new normal in terms of how we think and plan for business on the revenue side. Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, Abigail. And thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us call on IR. And on behalf of all the management team, I’d like to wish you a good day. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin. Thank you, Latoya, and welcome everyone to Agilent\\'s second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2015. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO, and Didier Hirsch, Agilent\\'s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Patrick Kaltenbach, President of Agilent\\'s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for financial results under the Financial Information tab. You will find an investor presentation along with revenue breakouts and currency impacts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You\\'ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. As a reminder, we will talk about core growth, which reflects growth adjusted for currency and for M&A within the past 12 months. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Before turning the call over to Mike, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its annual analyst and investor meeting in New York City on May 28. Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent investor website. Thanks, Alicia. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q2 call, my first as CEO of the new Agilent. I will start with a summary of our Q2 operating financial performance. Next, I will cover our progress on operating margin expansion and stock repurchases. Finally, I will close an update on our current guidance. I\\'m pleased to report that Agilent delivered solid earnings within guidance. I\\'m even more pleased to share the story of our top line order growth. This growth is being driven by a continued strong market acceptance of our new offerings and the effectiveness of our new sales structure. Let me start with four major operational highlights. First, our Agile Agilent program launched last quarter. This program is successfully removing costs from the business and allowing us to aggressively build a more nimble and streamlined company. Second, we addressed manufacturing-driven backlog issues in our nucleic acid businesses. As a result, we have returned DGG to double-digit profitability. A third operational highlight is some very good news. After a lot of hard work and significant investment, our FDA warning letter was lifted six months earlier than expected. Finally, we strengthened Agilent\\'s portfolio by divesting our XRD business. Now let me review Agilent\\'s financials for the second fiscal quarter. Our Q2 revenue was down 3% and grew 4% on a core or currency-adjusted basis to $963 million. Reported orders grew 1% and were up 8% on a core basis to $1.04 billion. Excluding the divested businesses of NMR and XRD, core revenue growth was 5% and core order growth was 10%. Book-to-bill increased 1.08, as we were unable to convert all this order strength into revenue within the quarter. Let me provide some additional detail. First, we had a lot of orders come in later in the quarter. Second, shipping challenges at our new Americas logistics center delayed some customer shipments until Q3. The shipping issue was a start-up issue and is being addressed; however, the order timing and shipping challenges accounted for approximately $30 million of revenue that was pushed from Q2 to Q3. The strengthening dollar also had an impact, reducing reported revenue by $6 million versus our guidance. Despite the revenue recognition delay, we are quite pleased with our bottom line performance. Operating margin, adjusted for Keysight billings, was 18.3%, up 140 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.38 with both the operating margin and EPS results matching guidance. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences Applied Markets Group, or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent\\'s analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth was 1%, or 2% excluding NMR. Growth was led by LC, microfluidics, mass spec, ICP-OES, and software. Orders were strong across the group, up 6% on a core basis and up 10% excluding NMR. As an aside, the previously communicated exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.8%. We saw excellent growth in LC systems in the second quarter. The new 1290 Infinity II system, which we launched in Q4, continues to be well received by the market. This system sets new benchmarks in analytical efficiency, quality, ease of use, and integration. We expect the 1290 Infinity II product portfolio to deliver double-digit growth through fiscal year 2015. We ship the new 6545 LCMS Q-TOF with a formal launch scheduled for the ASMS Conference at the beginning of June. The 6545 addresses a core Q-TOF market with better performance, increased uptime and robustness, and improved ease of use for small molecule applications. We released OpenLAB ELN 5.0. The new electronic lab notebook adds several core feature enhancements, including an iPad mobile client. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business under a new Agilent brand. ACG delivered outstanding results. Core revenues were up 7%, while core orders grew 12% in the quarter. Operating margin was 21.5%. In consumables, we expanded the Poroshell 120 family to include a new 4-micron particle size. Sales of this family have exceeded expectations and are contributing to continued growth in the Poroshell family. We released the AdvanceBIO sample prep kit, which adds to our separation and manual sample prep technologies. Our recently introduced A-Line supply portfolio is ramping well above expectations. And customers have responded very favorably to our new FRID (sic) [RFID] inventory management service solution. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, or DGG, is comprised of three divisions: the former Dako business, genomics, and nucleic acid solutions. DGG recovered nicely in Q2, as previously guided, delivering strong core revenue growth of 10% versus a year ago. Dako and the nucleic acid businesses led DGG\\'s results. Orders grew 5% on a core basis. DGG returned to double-digit operating margins, delivering 15% in Q2. In April, we announced that the U.S. FDA lifted its warning letter on Agilent\\'s Dako, Denmark subsidiary earlier than expected. We\\'re on track for the remaining remediation efforts to be completed by Q3. And our companion diagnostics engagement with Merck continues to make progress. In April, Merck submitted a biologics license application to the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer. Omnis Instruments continued to gain customer traction, setting a new quarterly record for instrument placements. And SureFISH again saw strong growth, driven by sales through the pathology channel. This is just one example of the synergy that we\\'re able to leverage across the new Agilent. Our expertise and experience in analytical labs continues to drive further penetration into adjacent clinical and diagnostics laboratories. We expect these types of synergies to be characteristic of the new Agilent. In keeping with our strategy of executing bolt-on acquisitions of complementary growth businesses, earlier this month, we announced our acquisition of Cartagenia for €60 million. Cartagenia is a leading provider of software and services for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. Now, let\\'s take a brief look at Agilent\\'s end-market performance on a core basis. Pharmaceutical revenue grew strongly with broad-based results across customers and products. We also saw excellent demand in clinical and diagnostics, with revenue growing solidly during the quarter. Growth in food and environmental revenue was more modest, led by demand from China. Academia and government revenue decreased slightly due to some delayed budgets and order backlog build. Chemical energy saw a similar decrease from lower oil prices, as expected. The decline in oil production and exploration was partially offset by refining and chemical demand. Geographically, we saw excellent core revenue growth in the Americas, with moderate growth in Europe and Asia excluding China and Japan. Greater China orders were strong, though not yet reflected in revenue. Similarly, Japan core revenue declined but saw single-digit core growth in orders. As you know, we completed the CEO transition at the March 18th shareholder meeting, and our new leadership team is fully in place. During our Q1 call, I highlighted three focus areas where we\\'re working as a team to drive shareholder value. As a reminder, they are: accelerate organic growth, expand operating margin, deploy capital for long-term shareholder value. Turning from the report out of the momentum in our core growth, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q2 capital deployment actions. We are executing our multi-year Agile Agilent program, reengineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. Our previously announced restructuring is underway. The new sales channel and divisional structure are fully implemented. We continue to look for opportunities to streamline and rethink our legacy business models. The recent closing of our U.S. Government Affairs office is just one example. We have already delivered $24 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We remain committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY 2017. As previously guided, this year we\\'re on track to return $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. In Q2, we repurchased $162 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $168 million. In our Q1 call, we raised our core growth guidance and commit to offset $0.05 of negative FX impact through cost controls and other actions. We are confirming this full year EPS guidance. Didier will provide further details in his remarks. As the new CEO, it gives me great pleasure to announce that Forbes has identified Agilent as one of America\\'s best employers in its first-ever ranking. We\\'re rated as a top employer in the healthcare equipment and services industry category. Part of my mission would make us even better. We look forward to seeing you at our May 28th analyst meeting in New York. We\\'ll take that opportunity to discuss Agilent\\'s businesses in more detail. I look forward to sharing more about the steps we are taking to reach the goals we have set to drive long-term shareholder value through accelerated growth, operating margin expansion, and optimal capital allocation. Thank you for joining our call today, and I\\'ll now turn it over to Didier, who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\\'s financial results and guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of closed and divested businesses, were respectively 10% and 5%. As Mike stated, about $30 million of revenues was carried over into Q3 due to late incoming orders and some startup issues with the transfer of our U.S. distribution center. Those issues have now been stabilized and they will be fixed this quarter. Although revenues ended up $32 million under the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, 10 basis points higher than guidance, and 140 basis points higher than last year on 2.5% lower nominal revenues. This quarter, currency subtracted about 6.8 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. Finally, we bought back $162 million of stock in Q2 and generated $183 million in operating cash flow. I\\'ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $995 million to $1.015 billion and EPS of $0.38 to $0.42. At midpoint, revenue will grow 7% on a core basis. Our 18.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be equal to this quarter\\'s operating margin. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program and reach the planned $365 million of repurchases by year-end. Now to the guidance for the fiscal year. Versus our previous guidance, currency is forecasted to have a $10 million negative impact on revenue. We are adjusting our revenue guidance for that impact, but we are not modifying our EPS guidance. We expect fiscal year 2015 revenues to range from $4.05 billion to $4.11 billion and fiscal year 2015 EPS to range from $1.67 to $1.73. Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. My first question is really on the guidance. So you slightly reduced full-year revenue growth expectations, but not by much. I believe your second half core growth would have to exceed about 7% to get to your full year guidance. When you combine these observations with the observation that you talked about strong backlog heading into the third quarter, but then you guided revenue expectations a bit below where consensus stood, it does seem like second half growth is not only expected to accelerate but also to be a bit more back-end loaded than most of us were expecting. Could you just talk about what gives you confidence in the implied Q4 growth acceleration expectations that you seemingly built into guidance? Yeah, Doug, this is Mike. Thanks for the great question. And let me offer some additional commentary on our thinking about the confidence we have in the top line momentum and also our thinking about how we guided for the second half. When we look – obviously, very pleased with the top line momentum that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And if you look at it, we\\'ve had two strong top line order quarters for the company. And what we\\'re seeing is strong market, end-market strength in pharma, clinical and diagnostics, a strong U.S. and recovering China market. And we believe we\\'re very well-positioned, which is reflected in the order numbers, to capture this growth with the strength with not only our portfolio but also our new sales structure. As I did mention in my remarks, though, we did have some startup issues with the logistics center. And also, we saw a late time in orders coming in the quarter. So we\\'re becoming increasingly mindful of what seemed to be a change of customer buying behavior as we look at our revenue projections for the third quarter. But with the backlog, the ongoing strength of the top line, we remain quite confident in our ability to deliver on the top line growth forecast. Didier, anything else that you would add? No, just to quantify. I mean, the $30 million that moved into Q3 is equivalent to 3 percentage points of revenue, if you would adjust the first half of that 3 percentage points, that really moved into the second half, then the growth between the first half to the second half is a lot more reasonable. Yeah, and Doug, it may also help you to hear directly from each of the group presidents how they look at their respective business just to give you a better feel for how we\\'re thinking about the business in the second half. And Mark, perhaps I can start with you? Thanks, Mike. And obviously this is another quarter where we\\'ve produced double-digit core order growth. So from the standpoint of the response we\\'ve got in the marketplace around our innovative products and services has been quite good. And I think it\\'s a validation of our CrossLab strategy and the value we have for the customers. And looking forward, the fundamentals, as you suggest, really don\\'t change much as we look at the end market strength in Americas and in China and some other places around the globe. And we continue to have strong demand from Europe. So long story short, it\\'s a continuation we see of the strong fundamentals we have right now. Yeah, thanks Mike. So for LSAG, we have seen continued strong performance in our core product lines like LCMS, ICP-OES throughout Q1 and Q2. There\\'s a lot of very strong momentum behind these new products that we recently introduced. And solutions like the Infinity II LCs that you mentioned or the ICP-OES and our high-end LCMS solutions. So for the second quarter, as you stated before, we had order growth on a core base of 10% excluding RPD. I think we have a very strong pipeline. We see a strong funnel, and therefore also are committed to the second half. Yes, certainly. As you have noticed, DGG had a strong Q2, definitely compensating for the challenges in Q1. And we see the improved momentum in all our divisions. Soon being out of the FDA activities and back to normal operationally, I do expect to see the pathology business continue to strengthen throughout the rest of the year together with the rest of the portfolio. So I also have very strong confidence in the second half year. Great. That\\'s really helpful, and given all the detail I will step away, get back in the queue, and let some other folks ask some questions. Thanks again. Hi, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just I guess another question in terms of the back half expectations. Clearly, the trend for the operating margin has been a bit down with some of the dissynergies coming from the spinout. But as we think about coming into the end of the year, can you help us with the pacing? I mean, it seems like the implied guidance would still have us down marginally in the back half of the year, but quite a substantial improvement versus the first half. So any thinking you can help us with on the operating expenses as they move into the back half of the year I think would be appreciated. Yeah, Dane, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. I\\'ll make some initial comments and then pass it over to Didier. So as you saw in my prepared remarks, we were quite pleased with the operating margin performance for the business, particularly in that revenue came in below our initial expectations, albeit we\\'ll pick it up in the second half. And you also saw that I went to some length to describe the costs that have been coming out of the structure already, and we\\'re about halfway through the $50 million commitment already. So I think as the final tail-off of our restructuring starts to hit and some of the other costs and some of our other aspects of our Agile Agilent program start to hit, you\\'ll see us continue to bring down the operating expenses in the coming quarters. And, Didier, I don\\'t know if you want to add to that? Yeah, I\\'ll just, and you know, as you have been able to calculate, I mean our guiding midpoint for an operating margin in Q3 of 18.3%, which is at the same level as we\\'ve had in Q2 with slightly lower gross margin. Q2 had some very favorable currency hedging gains and slightly higher OpEx, mostly because of currency and some slight increase in stock-based compensation. And then for Q4, the implied operating margin for the Q4 to get to the 19% for the whole year, which we are guiding to, would be 20.9%, which would be slightly higher than what we achieved last year of 20.4%, which means that we will see then the full impact of the Agile Agilent program as with an increase in operating margin, even though we are facing still the $40 million dissynergies that we\\'ve talked about at length. Okay. So yeah, I guess the overarching theme that Doug kicked off with was a pretty strong fourth quarter. Maybe you could just kind of elaborate on the comps that you have from the fourth quarter last year. Was there something particularly weak in terms of how the business is constituted last year that maybe you\\'d hit better overhead absorption, et cetera, in the fourth quarter this year along with some strong organic growth comps? I guess that\\'s probably what we\\'re kind of grasping at here is, where the confidence for the fourth quarter specifically is coming from. I think it\\'s twofold, right? One is we do have some level of easy compares, I would say that, particularly as Jacob mentioned in his earlier comments, we now see our DGG business back on track, but we were seeing a retraction in terms of our growth at this time last year. So I think there is an element of, if you will, easier compares in Q4. I think Q4 historically is always our strongest quarter, and we\\'ve got this very strong order momentum and backlog going into the back half. And I would say we\\'re trying to guide fairly conservatively for Q3 on the revenue as well. Yeah so, certainly to emphasize what Mike has said, last Q4 was 1 percentage point lower core revenue growth than the average of the year. So it was kind of, I would say, a weaker quarter in terms of revenue growth that we saw throughout the year. And then as I mentioned, we are guiding for an operating margin of 20.9, which is not that far away that we achieved in Q4 of last year of 20.4%. And obviously we are, as you have noted, expecting higher revenue on an easier compare. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First question for me was on China. It seems like for the most part this sector has seen a modest improvement, or at least stability, in that region this quarter. And there may be a couple outliers where we saw commentary that was perhaps more cautious. So, if you could talk a little bit about what you saw there across your end markets and what\\'s baked into your expectations. Sure, Isaac. Thanks again for joining the call. I just got back from a week or so in China in the early part of April, and I\\'ll share with you today in the call what I shared with our board at the time, which was I continue to see a gradually improving overall market environment in China. I think that there\\'s a level of pessimism about the China market, which I think is not called for. When you look at where the market is growing, and we put up high single digit market growth orders in our second quarter, you see a continued strong pharma, biopharma investments in life sciences, in human health. We see that much of the reorganization of the food ministries are behind us. In fact, I had an opportunity to represent Agilent at the BOA conference where we heard President Xi talk about his Silk Road policy, and there is also a major forum on food safety, which I participated in. And there\\'s no doubt that the food safety areas will be back on track in terms of investment. And then I think you\\'re seeing – you can count on really strong growth in the environmental segment for I think years to come. I think the one area which was a little bit more subdued in terms of overall growth would be the chemical and energy space, but that we expect still to grow in the low-single digits. So I think that the days of those double-digit market growth in China are behind us, but I think you can expect to see solid market growth in China throughout the rest of this year. Great. That\\'s helpful. And just dovetailing on your last comment there about chemical and energy, it\\'s obviously I think 25% of the business now, so perhaps maybe a little more important than we\\'ve previously appreciated. And it\\'s no surprise obviously that the commodity price there has hurt spending. But I\\'d be curious, in the past you\\'ve talked about how when the commodity prices come down, there\\'s actually a bit of an uptick that you see downstream in the markets you serve on the chemical side that are oil-price sensitive, so I\\'d be curious if you could talk a little bit about from a timing perspective. How we should think about that tailwind kind of helping to offset the CapEx pressure. Thanks, Isaac. You have a great memory on earlier conversations. So, in fact, what I think I\\'ll do is I\\'ll pass it over to Patrick. He can provide some insights on that end market. Yeah, thank you, Mike. And you\\'re right – it makes up about 25 – chemical and energy makes up about 25% of Agilent\\'s business, and – but as a reminder, the decline is mainly driven by the impact on the falling oil prices. And we have seen most of it on the customers on the exploration side. And actually that segment is only 15% of our chemical and energy segment overall. So I think actually there is some upside still on the chemical side based on the lower feedstock prices that has not yet materialized. I think these customers are still a little cautious to start more spending. So we will continue to carefully monitor the situation. But I don\\'t see any immediate changes or more dramatic reductions in the business overall. I think, again, there will be into 2016, probably you will see the shortfall on the exploration side, but it\\'s positive momentum what we can expect – positive momentum on the chemical side. Hey, thanks. Mike, can you just clarify how much of the $30 million delay was self-inflicted versus – the shipping center stuff versus the customer order side? And on the customer side, was that all academic? Tycho, you kind of broke up a bit in the call. I think you\\'re asking about the breakdown of the $30 million revenue? Oh, yeah. Got it. Got it. It\\'s roughly 50%-50%. So, about $15 million of it was through the start-up issues with our logistics network in the United States, and the other $15 million was from very late coming in orders that we couldn\\'t turn into revenue within the quarter. And then can you maybe touch on share dynamics? I\\'m sure we\\'re all going to get the question tomorrow, given that Waters have been up 15% organic. Can you maybe just talk about how much of what you\\'re seeing was – I mean the order book was up 6%, so that\\'s the silver lining. But can you just talk about your ability to hold share in this environment? And any color on pricing would be helpful too. We\\'re doing more than holding share, we\\'re taking share is our view because we had 10% core order growth in the marketplace, and with the one exception of Waters, I don\\'t think anybody\\'s putting up numbers like this in the space. And as you may be able to dig into some of the details and remarks, some of the areas where we compete directly with Waters in LC, LC-MS and pharma and biopharma, I think, Patrick, you might want to jump on this as well. We saw very, very strong growth. So, I think there is a different composition of our portfolio and end-market play than Waters, but where we compete we\\'re clearly holding our own. Absolutely. And I want to speak here only to the auto side because we had these issues on the revenue side. But both in LC as well as in MS, our orders have been up double-digit, so we see a strong momentum, as I said in the beginning, behind our new Infinity II series and also behind our – mainly behind our high-end LC-MS systems like the 6495 Tripe Quad. So I would say we are competing very effectively. Mike, just a question on the pharma market. I think this is the first time in a little while you\\'ve mentioned a large pharma group as being a source of strength in the period. Are you seeing a recovery from that customer base? And just kind of talk about the outlook I guess for the balance of the year in the pharma market. Yeah, good catch, because we\\'ve been talking before about the small and medium size in specialty pharma, so it\\'s a broad-based recovery, and we\\'re really starting to see the large pharma investing and really coming off their delayed technology refresh plan. So I think that\\'s why Patrick mentioned earlier the very strong growth we\\'re seeing in our LC and LC-MS product line. So, this is a much larger broad-based recovery across pharma than we have pointed to in the past. And then biopharma continues to be a strong segment in the industry as well. And one more for Didier. Given the Dako resolution came in about six months earlier than planned, curious why the incremental spend that\\'s baked into the outlook isn\\'t lower I guess relative to the prior view of about $15 million of incremental spend. Good question, Brandon. It is slightly lower. We are planning to spend about $15 million. There is a lot of work that needs to be done towards – until about June, and then we will stop seeing a serious pay down of the expenses. But don\\'t forget, I mean we are very, very serious on investing whatever we need to make sure that we comply with all the regulatory requirements. And Jacob, you probably want to add too. Yes. Surely, I mean first of all, we are obviously very pleased that we received the notice from FDA that the warning letter has been lifted, and as Didier\\'s also mentioning we will finalize the activities that we\\'ve committed to, to close out with FDA. Therefore, the spending is also a little bit lower than what we have guided earlier, but we will also continue to invest in a higher compliance level going forward. Good afternoon, guys. So I guess as we try to put tonight\\'s print in context, obviously, CapEx business or the backlog swings, we\\'ve seen these before. But it seems to happen here a little bit more than we\\'ve seen it at some of the other CapEx-focused players. So Mike, you\\'ve been spending a lot of time trying to reinvigorate sales and the sales organization, and obviously you\\'ve got your margin discipline you\\'re also trying to execute against. I mean as you think about all of the various moving parts here, do you feel like pushing the organization to degree that you are, this is sort of the result? Or do you think this is purely kind of just, hey, we just didn\\'t execute and things need to change? I\\'m just trying to figure out how to isolate – we heard the explanation before – kind of how to put in context all of the moving parts with kind of the outcome. Because obviously you sound excited, but I think the stock\\'s 5% now; the shareholders aren\\'t nearly as excited today. So I\\'m trying to figure out how to put that all together. Hey, Ross, thanks for the question and the acknowledgment of the efforts we have underway to really accelerate traction in a couple of key topics for us on a strategic nature. So, great question. So when I step back from them and look at this, which is, I went to great lengths to highlight the start-up issue we had with logistics center. But – and I think it\\'s an evidence of the new Agilent in terms of we\\'re going to make bold moves. We\\'re going to drive towards changing our cost structure. When we\\'re done here, we\\'ll have probably $3 million or so out of our cost structure, much improved customer experience. So – and then when I found out about my team and I learned about my team is when we have issues, such as the one we discovered once we went live in the later part of March, we got all over it. What I didn\\'t share with you was also the fact that we delivered 10% order growth in the midst of a major field reorganization. So I think that we\\'re not pushing the team too hard. We have the ability to execute and to drive the company forward aggressively. There will be – perhaps will be some times won\\'t go completely according to plan. But what this team will do is get all over it as a team and work very quickly to address it. So hopefully that gives you some insight in terms of how the company is running inside. We\\'re enthusiastic, we\\'re energized, and I don\\'t think anybody believes that they\\'re overly taxed yet. And maybe as a follow-up, so you bought a little bit more stock this quarter, but it\\'s still a pretty small amount relative to your overall share mix. So we just saw last week, one of your larger peers buy a separations chromotography asset for 19 times EBITDA. As you think about sort of the value of your asset, particularly relative to all of the things you\\'re doing to hopefully augment and fix and improve the profitability of it, as you think about sort of harnessing some of those returns for Agilent shareholders, and maybe you\\'ll cover it in more detail at the Analyst Day. But how are you guys thinking about the share buyback, just given sort of all the various data points out there in the market? Yes, thank you, Ross, for that question. So right now, what you heard today was that we\\'re doing what we said we would do, which is we would buy back $365 million of stock, and we are well on our way to doing that. However, as also I\\'ve said in prior calls, we continue to look at our overall capital allocation policy, how we\\'re deploying capital for return to shareholders. And perhaps as a teaser for the May Analyst Meeting next week, I\\'ll say more to come. CrossLab was a little lower growth in the current quarter than the 10% or so organically in January\\'s quarter. Was that due to this re-org you were talking about, Mike, or what was going on with CrossLab? Was it weather, et cetera? No, we\\'ve got a lot of our – and Mark you can jump in as well. We got a lot of our revenue hung up in the logistics center issue that I talked about earlier, because we have such a high velocity of consumables and support parts going through, not only the U.S. logistics center for U.S. customers, but also as a gateway into our global customer base as well. So you\\'ll note in our prepared remarks, I think we had 12% organic order growth. So it really was a story on the logistics center. But Mark, anything else you want to add? Well there\\'s the other nuance, Mike, which in services, obviously order growth doesn\\'t translate immediately to revenues. And this 12% growth, a lot of that came through services. And what you\\'ll see is that becomes an annuity stream going forward for the remaining quarters. So I would say we put some money in the bank for looking out into the next year. Yeah and then, Paul, that\\'s also why again there\\'s been a lot of questions about the second half revenue outlook, and this is one of the reasons why we\\'re confident in our outlook. Is CrossLab one of the major reasons you think you\\'re taking share, along with the obviously the instrument technology. But is it a reason? We think it\\'s a combination of both, right. So we\\'re driving really new innovative new solutions, so we\\'re putting more instruments into the marketplace and taking share. But we also embrace in a strategy which I think, and we\\'ll go through some level of detail next week, where we really believe there\\'s a broad-based play across the whole laboratory environment, not only for services and consumables for our instrumentation, but in the broader vendor base as well. And I think it\\'s very clear that we\\'re picking up very good business and services in consumables, and I\\'m guessing it\\'s above market. I certainly think it is, Mike, but I would say what our intent is, obviously to ensure we differentiate all of the solutions Agilent brings to the market. I feel confident a lot of the innovation we have is driving that share gain. It was negative on the revenue side and the positive on the order side, and revenue was kind of a negative low single digit. Yes, exactly. And perhaps low to mid single digits on the revenue side. And again, as Patrick said, it\\'s very difficult this quarter to talk about revenue considering the $30 million. And for example, a lot of that impacted China because although we kind of recovered some towards the end of the quarter, because of the shipment times, we were not able to recognize revenue, in particular in China. It was the region that was the most impacted by the $30 million revenue shortfall. The facility is in the U.S., but it ships all over on whatever is produced in the U.S. And including, for example, it ships GCMS into China, and because of a long transit time, China was positively impacted. Let\\'s just start by rounding out the geography. You called out Japan. So subsequent to the revenue commentary, you made a comment there, much like China, that the orders were very strong. It seems like while you\\'re certainly not the first to call out Japan as an area where there are a few moving parts, can you give us a sense for what it is that you\\'re seeing in Japan? Number one, is this an area where some of the shipment delays are having an impact? Number two, to the extent there is any softness there, where are you seeing it? And number three, how do you see it playing out over the balance of the year? Yes sure. thanks, Steve, for the opportunity to talk, provide some insight into Japan. Different story from my perspective than China. Though we were pleased to see the order growth that we saw in Q2, we have to keep in mind that it was off a relatively easy compare in 2014. And I think we know the history there with the Japanese implementation, the VAT tax, and how it really changed the seasonality of orders for everybody in the early part of last year. What we\\'re seeing going forward is a environment where we\\'re expecting continued weakness in the academia and government segment. The quantitative easing budget money doesn\\'t seem to be really flowing into our space. The flip side of that is, we\\'re actually seeing improvements in the private sector. Now it\\'s a very fragile environment right now, but we think that if it\\'s holding together, we expect it to be subdued. It won\\'t be the same level of growth as you\\'re going to see in China, but we\\'re also not seeing any kind of significant downturn. And Didier, I don\\'t know if you have any other observations on Japan. No, I mean what we are seeing and what we\\'ve started seeing in April certainly seems to tie also with the general projections from the economies that are seeing that after Q1 with a negative GDP growth, Q2, Q3 growth will accelerate and will clearly be positive during those two quarters. So we are hoping that they are right for the one. Okay, very helpful. And then, just one housekeeping question for Didier. With Cartagenia now in the books and the XRD transaction, can you give us a sense for how much incremental we should expect on the top line from these transactions over the balance of the year and hopefully for next fiscal year? Thanks so much. Yes, let\\'s say that for the immediate future, it\\'s not going to move the needle, and I probably would leave it at there. Jacob, do you want to add any color? No, I agree, Didier. I mean first of all, most impact of Cartagenia is going to be minimal in the short-term future in the whole Agilent picture. But I do believe that Cartagenia is a very important pillar in our strategy going forward, where we want to really develop the workflows into pathology labs and focusing on – and on genetic disorder labs also. I certainly couldn\\'t agree more, but just to put a finer point on it, between XRD and Cartagenia, can you give us any sense for what the run rate in terms of dollars was on revenue for those businesses? Thanks so much. Didier, I\\'ll just jump in. On the XRD, it was a little less than $15 million or so of revenue, and then we had about 88 employees associated with that business mainly in Poland that now have joined Rigaku. Anything else you want to add, Didier? Afternoon, guys. Thanks. Mike, does the outlook for the rest of the year pretty much assume that demand from the energy customers stays where it is? Or are you assuming you maybe start to get a little bit of relief. You\\'ve gotten a slight rebound in crude prices over the last month or so. I\\'m not sure that\\'s meaningful to your thinking at all. No, great question, Dan. Thanks for the opportunity to comment. No, we\\'re not expecting any kind of rebound, just staying the status quo. If – I think Patrick pointed to more of a 2016 kind of up rebound on the chemical side of that. So it happened before, that would represent upside to our thinking, but we\\'re not currently forecasting that. Okay, thanks. And then Didier, on the Agile Agilent savings, should we look for what\\'s left on the $50 million for the year to be recognized pretty evenly in the back half? Or might that be weighted towards one quarter than the other? No, I mean it\\'s slightly obviously a little bit more in Q4, but Q3 is going to be fairly significant. So, perhaps 45/55 in the second half between Q3 and Q4. Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Mike, do you think the customer order patterns have changed permanently, or was there something unique to the quarter that you called out? And then secondly, I guess, have you seen any change in the order cancellation rate? Yes, Jeff, great question. So in fact, we\\'ve really been asking ourselves all the same question, which is, we saw a different seasonality in this Q2 than last year. So all we kept coming back to was we really can\\'t control the customer buying behavior. So I really don\\'t have a good solid answer for you. But what we are going to do, and I think I hinted at it earlier, we\\'re going to be adjusting our revenue forecasting models, sort of increasingly mindful of what seemed to be a changed timing of order flow within the quarter, so does seem to be customer-driven. I can\\'t really put a logical explanation behind it. So what we want to do is we want to evolve in our forecasting models from a revenue standpoint. And in terms of order cancellation, it\\'s not at all on our radar screen as a topic of concern. Got it, okay that\\'s great. And just a follow-up, Didier, can you give us a segment break down for the $30 million of I guess of orders that got slipped out of the quarter? It was mostly around LSAG. I mean clearly, DGG had no impact; ACG a little bit, but relatively minimum. It was mostly LSAG instruments. Mostly instruments. Hey, so sticking with Jeff\\'s question, changes in ordering patterns, but was there any sort of pricing competition at the end of the quarter, any unusual changes from your competitors? Or is it just customers just behaving differently? Yeah, as I look around the conference room here, everybody is shaking their head no. No really significant changes from competitors or pricing behaviors. Okay and on – you\\'ve gotten rid of NMR, XRD. Is there anything else within that old Varian business? For example, the old vacuum pump business that is no longer core to the organization? Yeah, no, thanks for the great question. So I think that you see, Derik, that we\\'re continuing to look at our portfolio and we\\'re quite happy with the status of the portfolio right now. And in fact, on the vacuum side, we\\'re seeing – I\\'ve got a profitable business that we actually see has a fair amount of synergies in Agilent, particularly as we think about designing and developing next-generation of mass spectrometry and kind of being able to integrate the pumps in a different manner, in terms of our new systems, albeit, also the fact that we\\'ve integrated them on a sales-force perspective to also take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the analytical lab. We see it as an enabler for our CrossLab business. So, I\\'ve got a business that\\'s making money, and I can see the synergies with the rest of the company. So it\\'s solid right now within Agilent. Great and just one final question. So you said XRD was about $15 million, and remind me what the NMR hit was to this year? Yes, on the year-over-year basis, it was relatively minimum. I\\'ll give you the numbers. But it had a much bigger impact on orders, obviously, because we stopped taking orders. So last year, we had about $50 million of orders for the whole year on NMR, and this year, is even slightly negative because we canceled a few of the orders in the backlog. And in terms of revenue last year, we had about $80 million in revenue. This year, we\\'ll have about $65 million, and we\\'ll have some revenue even next year as we recognize revenue on the last OEM magnet that we stopped taking orders on back two years ago, but we are still shipping. Yes, good afternoon guys. Let me start with a question on the sales-force reorganization. Perhaps remind us how exactly you reorganized, other than the divisional changes that you made. Perhaps a little bit more on the things that we cannot see from the outside: incentives, territories, compensation. It sounds like you didn\\'t think this impacted your ability to close orders. But give us a sense as to when you might see perhaps, a positive impact from the reorganization? Yes, thank you, Miro. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So I think we\\'re already – I\\'ll go in a second on the details of the reorganization, but we\\'re already seeing the impact, which is again, I think phenomenal order results in the second quarter, building on a strong Q1. And what we\\'ve done is we\\'ve gone from five sales forces to two. We have one sales force that\\'s focused on the diagnostic and genomics area, which is really our regulated marketplace. And then we now have one sales force that covers the entire analytical lab from pharma, chemical, environmental, food, forensics, life science research, and as I mentioned earlier, also inclusive of the vacuum. Those organizations previously were three separate organizations, and it led to a lot of extra cost. But even – perhaps even more importantly, it led to a lot of unnecessary internal interaction about accounts assigned, the territory assignments, was this a life science account or a chemical analysis account? That dialogue is completely gone now. We\\'ve integrated under one global leader, and now all of our energy is focused on optimal territory assignments, taking care of the customers, and taking share from the competitors. So I couldn\\'t be more delighted in terms of how the integration and reorganization of our sales force has gone. And again, I think it\\'s going to allow us to put more energy, more resources, more focus on front-line channel expansion, as opposed to internal dialogue and cost structure. Patrick, do you want to add anything? Yes, I just want to add in terms of what you probably don\\'t see from the outside is in terms of the divisional changes we made is we made a significant change in our MS business. We basically brought together the TCM LCMS business and 50% of all the labs organization into one new strong mass spectrometer group. And I think the result of that will basically we see more in the future, as we have now much more horsepower on the R&D side to develop new product for what we see as the fastest growing market segment for us. Yeah. Thanks for that, Patrick. And we talk internally and here we talk next week about One Agilent, we really are trying to leverage the full power of this company by organizing ourselves to get the maximum leverage out of the capability we have with the company Okay. Thank you very much for this color. And on the FDA warning resolution, congrats on getting this ahead of time. You already commented a little bit on the cost side. But do you have – does this allow you to launch new products? Do you have anything in the pipeline that you could start launching now post-remediation? Yeah, absolutely, and you\\'re right on, of course having to deal with an FDA warning letter, you have a lot of operational focus on dealing with that warning letter and taking some of our focus away from new product development. Fortunately, we have more sites. We have had strong development activities on other sites like the Carpinteria side and also our genomics side. We, in particular, within our companion diagnostic, we are looking into some very, very exciting launches coming up over the next quarters. I think you heard already Mike alluding to Merck & Co. has communicated their ambitions within the PDL1 assay – PDL1 drug target, and we are together with them on coming out with a PDL1 assay. And we definitely look into over next quarters at least one launch in that area maybe even two. And on the genomics side, we have had quite a lot of exciting launches this quarter also that I could talk a long time about, but I don\\'t think we have time for it right here. In the diagnostics business, just going through the slides, the delayed Q1 shipments, is there a way to quantify what that helped in the quarter? And then as you look into the back half, just being able to press some of the better growth now that you\\'re past the warning letter and the manufacturing issues there? Yes, thanks, Jack, for the question. I\\'ll pass it over to Jacob or perhaps, Didier, you want to weigh in on this as well? Well, you are definitely right that our performance this quarter is a bit skewed by these orders that return to revenue into Q2. But we have an underlying business improvement, both in the pathology business with the rest of the portfolio that will start now to drive the underlying business growth. So I expect to see an improvement in our performance on all elements, especially particularly in the pathology business. We once again saw record placements of Omnis, and this is a great indicator that we will start to see strong traction in the pathology business. So I\\'m very comfortable – confident that we received the growth coming from the business going forward. And then, yeah, just the last one, Didier. You mentioned the hedging cadence in the quarter. Can you just remind us how that works, and then is there a way to quantify on the earnings side what the total FX impact was? Yes, absolutely. So we have, in addition to our structural hedging program, we hedge both our balance sheet and our cash flow, and the accounting treatment is different. The balance sheet hedging gains and losses show up in other income and expense below the line, whereas the cash flow hedges, the financial impact of the cash flow hedges shows up in cost of sales. And as there was the fairly dramatic, as you have noticed disconnection of changes in currency rates in the last two or three quarters, I mean we have had fairly significant currency hedging gains. In Q1 they were about $3 million to $4 million. In Q2, they were about $7 million, so this Q2. And because we settled the hedging programs always at the beginning of the quarter, we already know what our currency hedging gains will be in Q3. And they will be about $3 million. So there\\'s a $4 million reduction in hedging gains, and that reduction shows in the cost of sales of gross margin. So that\\'s why I was mentioning everything else being the same, gross margin would be impacted to the tune of 0.4 percentage points sequentially. Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\\'ll turn the call back over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us a call, and we\\'d like to wish you all a good day. Thanks again. Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

Today Agilent reported first quarter revenues of $1.03 billion, an increase of 2% versus last year. Orders of $995 million were up 2% over year ago, operating margin was 17.2%, earnings per share were $0.41. Mike and Didier will provide further details about Agilent’s Q1 performance, but before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to take a moment to thank the investor community for your ongoing support of Agilent. As most of you know, this will be my last earnings call as Agilent\\'s CEO. I am very proud of the accomplishments the team has made over the last 10 years. In 2005 we launched a strategic initiative to focus on our core expertise of measurement science and direct investments into the life science markets. We divested our semiconductor related businesses, SPG now Avago, our semiconductor test business Verigy, now part of Advantest in our solid state illumination joint venture, Lumileds with Philips. With the Electronic Measurement business is the foundation of a Company, we embarked on a journey to turn a hardcore electronics company into a life science and diagnostics company. As a result of the enormous effort of the team, excellent organic growth and several key acquisitions, we have grown our analytical instrumentations, genomics and diagnostic business from $1.4 billion to $4 billion per year-on-year revenue gaining the number two position in the marketplace. This success led to our recently completed split of the company and the creation of Keysight Technologies. The ability of the company transform itself while spinning off or divesting businesses is a testament to the skills and dedication of its employees. Of course the work of the new Agilent is not done. We need to manage through the added cost of the separation to synergy and drive our operating margins higher. We will continue our commitment to be a leader in our market and we must capture the returns from the investment we have made in the clinical and diagnostic markets. Mike and his team are well prepared to lead the Company forward. Mike has a proven track record of building very profitable, market leading businesses. Mike\\'s new team has all the expertise, skills and drive to move Agilent forward. I believe our investors, customers and employees are in excellent hands. And now I’ll turn it over to Mike. Thanks, Bill. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible job that Bill has done leading this Company for the past 10 years. He not only transformed Agilent into an industry leader in life sciences, but is leaving us in a very strong position for our journey ahead. And on a personal note I could not ask for better partner during the CEO transition. Thanks Bill. Now I would like to share some additional insights on the transition and the quarterly results. The transition with Agilent is full swing. At the start of Q1 we announced the most expansive reorganization in our Company’s history. Three new business groups were formed to drive expansion in the core Analytical Lab and leverage its leading position to further penetrate the connected clinical research and diagnostics markets. We launched an Agile Agilent program to streamline and create a more nimble customer focused and faster moving company. In Q1 we delivered a strong start to the year, driven by the strength of our core Analytical Lab business. We delivered 2% reported growth or 6% core growth. We have strong profitability despite currency headwinds and challenges in our diagnostics and genomics business. Our Analytical Lab business, which represents 86% of the total Company is comprised of two recently reported business segments, the Life Sciences and Applied markets group and the Agilent CrossLab group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group LSAG brings together Agilent’s Analytical Laboratory instrumentation and informatics. LSAG’s revenues grew 2% reported growth or 5% on a core basis. Growth was broad based across most product lines and end markets. Operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%. Our growth continues to be driven by innovative new offerings. The Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC System which we launched in Q4 has been extremely well received by the market. This system sets a new benchmark in analytical instrument and laboratory efficiency. New spectroscopy products such as recently released FTIR, imaging hardware and software enhancements are accelerating research through improved workflows and opening up imaging to a wider range of non-spectroscopy customers. The new Agilent CrossLab Group, ACG which combines our Analytical Lab services and consumables business under a new Agilent brand delivered outstanding results. ACG revenues grew 5%, up 10% on a core basis. Growth was strong across consumable supplies, columns, sample prep and services. This reflects the innovative products we are bringing to market and the customer value proposition of our CrossLab strategy. We saw exceptional growth and demand for our QuEChERS sample prep kits. The introduction of RFID Inventory Management services were also well received by the market and customers. Operating margin for ACG was 20.7%. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions. First, former Dako Company’s focus on pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnerships. Second, the genomics division includes our arrays, NGS Target Enrichment and our other genomic solutions. Third, the Nucleic Acid solution division manufactured synthetic RNA to be potentially used an active pharmaceutical ingredients. DGG’s first quarter revenues declined 6% year-over-year down 1% on a core basis. We enjoyed record placements of Omnis Instruments, strong companion diagnostic business and strong SureSelect NGS Target Enrichment business. However, both of our Nucleic Acid businesses were significantly impacted by manufacturing issues that were resolved late in the quarter. Operating margin was 0.5%, impacted by the lower revenues and the remediation expenses to last year’s FDA warning letter. Those remediation efforts are going well on track with our expectation to be completed by Q4. We continue to strengthen our portfolio. In January DGG launched a new generic sure pre-screen kit. This kit provides an innovative test for abnormal number of chromosomes. At the same time DGG launched a new release of its cytogenetic software, which enables rapid analysis of samples processed with a pre-screen kit. Together this solution provides a faster turnaround on the market. Also in January we announced a strategic partnership with Cell Signaling Technology to supply antibodies for use with Dako-branded diagnostics products. We expect to return DGG to low double digit operating margins in Q2, driven by a recently announced restructuring initiative, and a return to normal manufacturing operations at our California and Colorado sites. Now let’s take a look at Agilent’s total Company performance by end markets on a reported basis. Pharma revenues were 6%. We saw strength in technology refresh deals, helping demand in mid to small sized pharma and sustaining growth in the aftermarket. We continue to see improving conditions in life science research or Academia & Government of 1% with increased funding from Europe and China. Demand for high end LCMS as well as GC, GC-MS, informatics and consumables drove results. Our Food Testing business grew 5%. We had solid growth worldwide as governments and major food manufacturers managed the challenges of a complex global food supply and public food safety demands. Environmental markets grew 4%, driven by China and the continuous focus on creating a cleaner environment. In addition to increasing enforcement of its existing environmental regulations, China is developing new monitoring methods and legislation driving growth in this space. Chemical Energy revenues were flat year-over-year as the industry responds to a greater than expected drop in oil prices. We saw a slight decline in Forensics down 2% as some U.S state and federal U.S agencies have delayed their capital purchases due to some budget uncertainty.  Turning to Clinical and Diagnostics, revenues declined 4% over a year ago. Their primary driver is manufacturing capacity constraints addressed late in the quarter. Geographically Americas grew 3%, Europe 2% and Asia 1%. China revenue, including Hong Kong was a source of strength, up by double-digits on demand from Food and Environmental customers and a relatively easy compare. On the other hand revenues in Japan were down 19%. This was primarily currency related due to the weakening yen, along with a difficult year-over-year compare. Moving to the year ahead in our last call I highlighted three focus areas to drive shareholder value. One, grow organically at the high end of the market; two, aggressively expand operating margins; three, deploy capital for long-term shareholders value. Moving from our update on the strong Q1 core growth, a few highlights on our operating margin improvement initiatives and capital deployment. The exit of the NMR hardware business announced in October is proceeding as planned. In Q1 we completed the closure and sale of our Lake Forest, California chemistry manufacturing site and consolidation of production volume into an existing Ashland site. We have initiated a restructuring program as part of the Company\\'s reorganization. We have also launched a multiyear Agile Agilent program, reengineering our Company to be a more nimble, efficient and customer focused. We expect gross savings of a minimum of $50 million in 2015 from all these actions. We will also continue to tax effectively deploy capital for a long-term shareholders value. This year as previously stated, we intend to return $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We will complete the CEO transition at the March 18th Shareholders Meeting with my new leadership team fully in place. My new team and I look forward to our May 28 Analyst Meeting in New York. At this meeting I will outline my strategic vision for the Company, our plans to outpace the market, drive EPS growth and achievement of our long-term operating model. It\\'s a full core press within Agilent to stay in our core growth trajectory, mitigate currency headwinds and drive earnings. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\\'s financial results and guidance. Didier? Thank you Mike and hello everyone. To summarize Q1 results, we delivered on our revenue and EPS midpoint guidance, even as currency impacted our revenue by $12 million and our EPS by $0.01. Also, adjusting for the $11 million reimbursements from key sites for Agilent IT and site services, our operating margin was 18.2%, 1 percentage point higher than the reported operating margin. Regarding our Q1 negative operating margin cash flow of $20 million, it was impacted by three factors. First, separation related expenses amounted to $33 million; second; transformation and [indiscernible] expenses amounted to $14 million; and third, we paid $42 million in taxes related to the spin. In addition we paid in December as usual the variable compensation related to the previous six months. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2015. The strengthening of the U.S dollar since our last guidance has a negative impact of $130 million on our revenue, $30 million on operating profit and $0.08 on our EPS. However thanks to the strength of our business and the initiatives underway that Mike mentioned, we anticipate offsetting about $0.05 of the currency impact. We are therefore only slightly modifying our previous guidance. We expect fiscal year \\'15 revenue of $4.06 billion to $4.12 billion. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth will be 1% on a reported basis but 6.9% on a core basis, the difference due to currency. Our core growth is driven by strong order funnel, expected recovery in our DGG business, the impact of a significant number of new products and continued improvement and demand from China. We project fiscal year ’15 EPS to range from a $1.67 to $1.73 with a midpoint of a $1.70. Please note that our EPS guidance assumes 338 million shares and that our annual operating cash flow is projected at $550 million. Finally moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we expect Q2 revenues of $985 million to a $1,005 million and EPS of $0.37 to $0.41. At midpoint revenue will grow 0.7% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7.5% on a core basis, the difference again as a result of currency. At midpoint, Q2\\'s adjusted operating margin of 18.2% will be 130 basis points higher than last year’s. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead. I have a question on your sales to Chemical and Energy companies. Is flat performance you reported in the quarter -- is that a reasonable reflection for how you expect sales in these end markets to trend with current oil prices or is there downside to this result? This is Mike. I think I want to pass it over to one of the newcomers on the call, Patrick Kaltenbach, who manages our Life Science and Applied Markets Group for his commentary on the impact of oil prices in that segment. Thank you, Mike. And we have reported our growth in the Chemical Energy segment actually have been flat this quarter. The negative impact of the oil price will most likely be seen, more of our customers who are on the exploration side and they make up about 15% of our total Chemical and Energy segment. The stronger part of the segment is actually on the Chemical side, which actually could see some nice tailwind moving forward with lower feedstock prices.  Well, as I would say, it\\'s the current version we see. Moving forward again I think both sides probably haven’t fully appreciated the oil price yet. You might see a little down turn on the exploration side, but on the other side, there might be also an upside, moving forward on the chemical side using the lower feedstock prices. And just to close off on Patrick’s comments, as he\\'s mentioned, only about 15% of this segment is actually impacted directly by the downward trend in terms of the less capital expenditure on the exploration side of the business, and we expect a continued re-pleasant [ph] market in this with stability in this market segment. And then my follow-up, could you elaborate on the performance in China and whether you\\'re seeing confirmation of the improved trends that you’ve baked into your guidance? Yes, as we’ve talked in the prior calls we’ve been fairly transparent in China about some of the operational issues we had historically and also our commentary has been that we were projecting a gradually improving market environment in China and I would say that in the first quarter we saw it actually come to fruition. So under the backdrop of gradually improving market environment, we’ve seen a return for example of some food deals. Our operational issues are behind us and we believe we’re growing above market in China. It will be a source of strength for us in 2015. Hey Bill, thanks for being a straight shooter for 10 years and congratulations. I guess my question would be you’ve had pretty exceptional growth in Europe as well. How do you explain that dynamic win has obviously been a risk area? Paul, I’ll go ahead and take call, Bill is saying, hey Mike it\\'s now your turn to feel the calls after 10 years of very transparent dialogue and you will find me to also be a straight shooter Paul, on these calls and our dialogues as well. I think it really comes back to the core of the strength of Agilent, which is the innovation, our go-to-market strategy. So we believe that in Europe, like other parts of world, we have been bringing to market some very innovative new offering to the customer and have a unique strategy focused on the CrossLab, both the services and consumer aspect and informatics of the laboratory. So we think the combination of our go-to-market strategy, the innovations that we’ve had in terms of the new product introductions, as well as our clear intent to go after not only the technology aspect of the lab, but the services that our consumables and informatics side of the lab has allowed us to, to outpace the market, in particular Europe performance has been really strong relative to the competition. Mike, it looks like your growth rate in analytical was above market. Do you think you are taking share and one of you been – from your experience in Wilmington, what’s happening the right way for you to be doing this kind of share gain? Yes, Paul thanks for the question. And when we looked at the performance for the first quarter, we had 6% core growth and if you actually stripped out the NMR, its 7% growth for us in the first quarter. I think it’s always -- I\\'ll leave the are we gaining market share question to my competitors. But we think that this recipe of new product innovation and really making sure our operational challenges are behind us and picking the right leaders I would add are really driving this strong growth and the growth across our portfolio is really broad based and in fact I’ll ask Patrick to make some few comments here as well. One other thing I forgot to mention Paul around our results in Europe, we had a very strong European regional manager who now is running our global sales operations and the new analytical lab sales force. So quite confident that the [indiscernible] will bring his talent to the globalization and you\\'ve seen his success already in Europe. And Patrick, maybe a little bit more comment on what you saw in the lab site for the instruments and then Mark, you can jump in on the CrossLab. Sure, thanks Mike. We definitely seen a lot of momentum based on our new regionally introduced portfolio and solutions like the Infinity II series LC that we launched in Q4, the ICP OES, the FTIR and high end MS solutions. Those products have been really well received by our customers and we actually have a very strong funnel behind these products. And that’s also why we are looking forward also to very successful Q2. Thanks Patrick and Mark, if could make a few comments on the CrossLab where the growth was really quite exceptional as we close off this question. Thanks Mike and obviously with the 10% core growth rate, we had strength in a lot of areas, but I would call out we had exceptional strength in the Americas with both the LC columns and in China our small molecules in general are growing and certainly -- so on the services side we continue to see in Europe in particular, growth from our enterprise services as well as our instrument services side. Mike can you just talk on multi-progression for the quarter? Just trying of get a sense of how January faired versus December and the strength of the order book exiting the quarter? Thanks for that question Tycho. So we saw solid order strength through the quarter. I would say we always get little bit of bump at the end of December as lot of our customers close off their budgets and then -- but with the quarterly quota setting process in the Company, there is always incentive for the sales people to close in June and January. So really no changes from a historical seasonality patterns of business through the quarter. And as we noted in the DGG side of our business, we actually built backlog during the quarter. And to that point when do you think Darko can get back to something resembling a market growth rate? Is that a ’16 event? How do we think about the earliest you could be back to kind of a mid-single digit growth rate potentially for that business? I’ll make some initial comments here, then introduce Jacob Thaysen, our Group President for our Diagnostics and Genomics business. So as you saw on our call notes, we think we’ll be back to low double digit profitability in the second quarter. Your question really is in terms of the overall top line return to market growth and above market growth and I think it’s -- what you’ll hear from Jacob is some really aggressive plans to continue to push the growth rate and many encouraging signs, particularly with the Omnis side of things but why don’t I not steal Jacob\\'s thunder and induce you to the community here in this call. Thank you, Mike and thanks Tycho for the question. I do believe that we have an exciting opportunity also in Darko to come back and we had a record number of shipments of Omnis in this quarter. And this is actually a very good indicator for an improved position in the market. And overall the market continues to be very attractive. We -- actually I do believe we have the right solutions to regain market share. For example also on the IQ HER2 FISH site, which is a very important component in diagnosing breast cancer, we have also launched a very good product that has been able to take the turnaround time form 24 hours down to be done within the same day. And this will actually allow the laboratory to perform analysis that was not possible to do before within the same day. And we see substantial market improvement also on that. So I do believe at this point of time we have the right products, we have the right team. And we will see momentum during ’15 and into ’16 also to regain into market. Last one just on the operational initiatives you highlighted Mike, I mean I think someone argued multiple and stocks kind of given you benefit for that, maybe some M&A expectation as well. But can you just talk about what you see as kind of the path to additional value creation from what you’ve laid out here? In other words why the reluctance to buyback more stock beyond the $365 million that you talked about and the reluctance to maybe cut a little deeper bit to try to get something north of a 22% operating margin by ’17? So I think I’ll make some initial comments here and then invite Didier into the dialog as well. As I outlined in the prior call and reemphasized today, we think that the way to drive additional appreciation of our share price is to aggressively go after improvements of our operating margin. We’ve outlined I think a fairly progressive plan, 400 basis points and we consider the synergies we\\'re starting off with as a Company. I outlined in my call today some very quick and expansive far reaching changes in how the Company is operating. The story is an organic growth and cost reduction story to drive our margins up. So that\\'s how we\\'re going to do it, by working the income statement and we have fully committed this year to high use of our available cash to repurchase stock. So again, $500 million of share repurchases and dividends is a plan for 2015. And Didier, I know you\\'ve done some analysis working with external folks as well in terms of how we\\'ve modelled aspects of leverage as it relates to stock repurchases. Yes clearly the leverage and buyback programs and dividend programs are ongoing topics of discussions with the Board. And the Board is assisted by a banker in making sure that we are making the right decisions to optimize shareholders value. So it is -- right now we are authorized to distribute $500 million which basically will put us in a zero cash position in the U.S towards end of the year. So we\\'re utilizing 100% of the cash that we have available. And again the Board is always looking at ways to optimize shareholder value.  Yes this quarter we bought back just a little bit. We continued buying back little bit after the end of the quarter. We have a 10b51 filing but it was minimum, yes. But we are still planning to buy back $365 million from now to the end of the year on an opportunistic basis. And Didier, if I would just add one additional comment here, when we look at our leverage versus our peers, we\\'re right at our peer group.  Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is open please go ahead.  This is Ryan Blicker signing in for Doug. So starting with China, can you provide more color on what you\\'re seeing in China that\\'s giving you increased confidence in your guidance and what level of growth from China is implied in the 2015 guidance? Sure Ryan. I\\'d be happy to offer some commentary on China. So in terms of the overall outlook of the market we see a gradually improving environment in China. It\\'s not a snap back to the types of market growth rates we have seen historically, but a gradually improving market environment. They are investing very heavily -- for example in the environmental areas I outlined in my call notes. We have seen -- as you know there has been a massive consolidation and reorganization of the food ministries in 2014. A lot of that reorganization is behind and we\\'re starting to see some bids for some projects and orders coming through. So the indication is from a total market perspective that the market is improving, albeit on a gradual basis.  But I\\'d say the China story is -- for Agilent is not just a market improvement story, it\\'s also the fact that the operational issues which we\\'ve been very transparent in disclosing to the investment community a while back, that is completely behind us. So we\\'ve got a very strong organization that really is aggressively going after the market in China. So I think it\\'s a combination of both a gradual improvement in market environment and our operational challenges are behind us in China. And we\\'re looking at high to mid-single digit kind of growth rate in China.  And then maybe one more on DGG and some of the recent companion diagnostics announcement. There have been some exciting partnership announcements over the last few months but just trying to think out how this impact 2015 results. Can you quantify what companion diagnostics are as a percent of Agilent or DGG sales now and maybe what you expect them to be as a percent of sales exiting 2015? What we can do is we can describe the rough breakdown of the three divisions that make up the DGG segments. Roughly 60% is in the pathology companion diagnostics reagent partnership space we talked about, 35% in the genomics and about 5% in the nucleic acid solution division. So in terms of additional financial breakdown, we wouldn\\'t be providing that down to the granularity of the companion diagnostics. But what I would do is ask Jacob to share some insight in terms of what exactly is going on with Agilent\\'s business in this space and why we\\'re so excited about the future possibilities here.  Yes thanks for that Mike. I think there is two elements to companion diagnostic. One is of course the fee for service with our pharma partners where we develop the next generation companion diagnostic and I\\'m really excited about all the partnerships that we have and we have plenty more in the pipeline and I really consider us as the leader within IC and FISH companion diagnostic. But obviously the big opportunity is with the companion diagnostic on the market and each market has its own potential. So the best way of looking at this that the usual suspect in the market today is CO2 [ph] market which has an overall market opportunity of around I think it\\'s $80 million to $100 million and then you have the other one, the big one, the ALK that has right now a market opportunity around $20 million to $25 million. It is difficult to say what each market will do, but I would imagine that that the companion diagnostic market in the future will be a great growth opportunity, but from launching products and seeing that to be a significant impact on ’15, that I do not consider, but we see substantial up take in our partnerships, that has a great momentum as we speak. Within DGG, just hoping you could expand it down the manufacturing issues that you ran into with the Nucleic Acid business, now I guess how much of the DGG revenue basis that piece comprised? Yes, so as Mike alluded to we have three overall businesses, the former Dako [ph], business, the pathology rating partnership and CDS and we actually saw performance according to our expectation on those businesses. So then we also have the genomics solutions division and then our nucleic acid solution division and in the nucleic acid solution division that’s where we saw the manufacturing chances. And as was alluded to before the genomics, the business is here, the nucleic acid solution business is very small business compared to others, but we have some larger customer and thereby moving the shipment from one quarter to the other actually have a significant impact on our overall performance. And Jacob as I recall, I think our genomics and NASD business is about 40% of the total of your segment. And then Mike or Fred on NMR, it sounds like the wind-down is on track internally there. So I guess curious what the current outlook is like for a sale of those assets, whether you\\'re seeing any interest there from growth in this space? Thanks. I\\'ll ask Patrick to provide some further insight, both in terms of the wind-down from the financial perspective, but also how we’ve been able to work with our customers, who as a result of our decision here and then we’ll double back on the question about the sales of the assets. Mike, as I said we are on track to sustain our ramp-down. We still expect that we have most of our NMR shipments completed by end of Q2. However, some of the MRI and OEM, both take until the end of the year. Also regarding the savings, we are well on track with that as promised over the last conference call which is based on the fact we have ramped down R&D and marketing as planned. When you look at our service capabilities, we have of course make sure that we are capable to service our customers, we are working closely with Mark\\'s organization to make sure we have everything in place to make sure that we can service our customers and our install base. In regards to the question about the aspect on the sale possibility, when I made the decision to exit the NMR hardware business, of course if it qualified buyer would surface and interested in taking on the full aspects and liabilities of the NMR hardware business, we will be quite open to that discussion, but we decided it was in the best interest on the Company to make a decision now to end the leading -- the implications on P&L, allows us to refocus our investment elsewhere and also to have a customer focused mitigation strategy retaining our services capabilities to support our customers. I just have one comment on the benefits of the exit. We committed to save $10 million -- to have $10 million increment operating profit in 2015 and 2016 and we are seeing much better results. So right now we’ve raised high expectations 2015 in the guidance. We expect to save $15 million and then $20 million in 2016 and that’s in our guidance. Want to follow-up with another question on NMR. Really you touched on some of the P&L benefits you\\'re looking for here and of course the organization benefits, but curious if you could maybe look at it a little bit from a working capital standpoint, just given the nature of that business and the extent to which you\\'re looking for some free cash benefits to the profile of your business ones all this is sorted out. Is there something you can quantify for us with regards to the benefits to the working capital and free cash flow? I would say in terms of free cash flow, it\\'s fairly similar to the increase in operating profit that as mentioned perhaps little bit higher, but -- and then for 2015 there is really not much difference in terms of working capital that we have, as Patrick alluded to, even though we\\'ll be -- we\\'ll have finished the production in the first-half, in the second half we’re going to do all kinds of installations and before we can [indiscernible]. Then we have time to collect the receivables. Obviously, inventories are coming down now. I can follow-up and give you the exact amount of the reduction of working capital to expect as a consequence of the closing, but I would say it\\'s probably immaterial in the grand scheme of things. Okay. And then just a second one on tax rate. Just wondering if you could quantify some of the opportunity that you see from a long-term here, either in terms of the magnitude of tax rate you could see, and maybe the pacing around it, just the benefits you\\'re looking for if any? Well the situation for the new Agilent is we have a lot more very profitable manufacturing activities in the U.S. with reagents and then the chemistries and also some instrument manufacturing, then proportionally all Agilent that we used to in the past, as Keysight had most of their manufacturing offshore. So the consequence is that it puts pressure on our tax rate and the 20% I see as fairly sustainable over the course of the next two, three years. What we’ll see after that. Obviously there\\'s all kind of debates that I\\'m hopeful in Congress will be to different tax regime, but at this point in time the best is to assume that we will maintain our 20% tax rate in the foreseeable future. In terms of the revenue growth outlook, 200 basis points higher, I\\'m pretty sure you’re probably the Company on the planet raising guidance at this point in the year. What gives you the confidence? What’s changed exactly relative to three months ago, one or two most important things, whether it’s China or new product flow? Can you parse that out for us? Sure, Brandon. Thanks for the question and first of all, I’ll start with the strength of our Analytical Lab business in the first quarter. It has momentum, it grew 6% core growth, 7% without the NMR impact fueled by new product introductions. The new products that we highlighted in our call last several quarters are driving new growth and the operational challenges we have in China are behind us and that’s in a backdrop of a gradually improving overall China market. So point one would be strength in the Analytical Lab business fueled by new product innovations and the addressing of previously disclosed operations in China and the second one is cognizant recovery in our diagnostics and genomics business. As we outlined in our call today, we had some operational issues that are being addressed and we’re quite confident in our ability to right the ship and get that business in the direction we want it to be. So there\\'s the two things I will leave you with, strength in the Analytical Lab business and the cognizant recovery of our diagnostics and genomics business. Okay, that’s helpful. And then Didier, just on the Agilent savings plan. I think you said gross savings expected at $50 million this year. If I just think about the bridge between your prior guidance for revised outlook, can you quantify the buckets between better organic growth, currency lowers, restructuring benefits, just the moving parts? Well, I did provide the currency impact and the rest is really way too many things. We are having good momentum on the restructuring program, the $50 million. Part of $15 million is NMR, $35 million is -- I would call the Agile Agilent programs which is ramping up nicely although there were some benefits already in Q1. There is some volume benefits also. A lot of other programs -- we are also making sure that we invest properly in our businesses to support our expectations to outgrow the market. So there is really lot of things we do and bridge that very carefully within the Company but there is a lot and lot of different factors. Didier this is Mike I would just add inclusive of guiding with continued momentum the assumption our Analytical Lab business and recovery of our diagnostics and genomics business, we are also taking other actions to offset the FX win. So this isn’t just a story of momentum on the organic growth side. It’s also true costs are coming out of our structure to drive our earnings per share and we’re pulling out all stops to address these FX wins without damaging our long term growth prospects. Just want to start with I guess the life science research business here in the U.S. It sounds like the total was a little bit more muted relative to I guess slightly more optimistic commentary from peers. I guess just curious what’s driving that and what you\\'re expectations are for the rest of the year? So we have seen -- as Mike alluded to, the growth in license research this quarter was mainly driven and coming from China and Europe, actually where we have seen higher demand from life science research. In the U.S. I think we are careful optimistic for the second part of the year that some of the funds will get released, but right now that [indiscernible] drive is coming, the momentum is coming out of Europe and China. Okay, and then just one more I guess in getting back to the leverage and cash that you have overseas. I was wondering if you had any thoughts just on what the optimal use of that cash is and then when you’d be able to put it to work. I think as we said earlier in our call today, we’re fully committed to tax effectively returning share to our stockholders. Agilent has a long history of doing that, over $10 billion during Bill\\'s tenure as CEO and we\\'re going to continue that strategy of getting cash back in a tax effective basis to our shareholders. As you heard from Didier, pretty much all of our U.S based cash will be gone by the end of this year, having returned that to our shareholders and D, I don’t know if you have anything else you want to add here? No I\\'m certainly again waiting for some movement in Washington and hopeful and we\\'ll see. If there would be an opportunity internally to repatriate cash under our new tax regime, I would be very much inclined to do so.  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead.  I wonder if we could start with a strategic one on Pharma as an end market. The comments that you made about the growth in biotech and spec Pharma are certainly consistent with what others are saying. I wonder if you are thinking now that the growth of the submarkets in Pharma seems to have diverged. If you\\'re thinking any differently about how to approach the biotech and spec firm segments of Pharma and if you could share with us what any of those strategies might be? So why don\\'t I make a summary comments and then invite Patrick in on this dialogue as well as Jacob. So overall as we reported 6% reported growth and a very strong end market segment for the Company, and as we also have been highlighting the biopharma, the biotech side of that has been a real area of strength as you peel back the segments within Pharma, moving away from the traditional small molecule analytical side. So pinched [ph] in both your perspectives on how you\\'re seeing that to respond to the question.  Happy to. This is Patrick speaking. So if we look at Pharma and total NMR growth comes from, of course we see all this Joe, the strong pockets like biopharma and the midsized companies but I think it would also be fair to say that during Q1 we have seen several large deals of replacement business coming from large Pharma. And as we -- so terms of strategies, there are several things for Pharma to be important. There is a lot of replacement business loss out there in big Pharma and the way we position our instrument, it\\'s making sure that we are 100% backwards compatible, while really deploying and offering the best solutions in the market and the most powerful solutions in the market. Like for example if we do see a [indiscernible] just recently launched this is a story that has been very well received, especially by the large Pharma companies. Now secondly when you look at biopharma, the strategy there for us is clearly working with our customers and looking at their demand, what their needs are as they develop biosimilars and other novel therapeutics, making sure we have not only the right equipment to test it, but also the right software solutions. So they have the right tools on hand to be as efficient and productive as possible.  Yes, so it\\'s our business is somewhat different from Patrick\\'s business here that we have our companion diagnostic which I have already described and then we have our Nucleic Acid solution division, which are developing or manufacturing the active ingredients for pharmaceutical components and we also see very high demand for that. So within the DGG business we continue to see a high demand from the Pharma industry.  Thank you, Jacob. And just to close out this question, just to remind those on the call, Mark\\'s, earlier comments about the growth and the services in the Pharma and how he\\'s approaching that marketplace.  And one this – I suppose this would be for Jacob. If we could just circle back to the new genetic screening kit launches that Mike referenced in his prepared remarks for chromosomal abnormalities and cytogenetics. Where are you seeing the most notable potential demand for these new kits? Is there any expanded promotional effort tied to those launches, just a little color on where you see those products headed? Thanks.  Well I would like to start by saying that we have a very, very attractive business within our array business within the cytogenetics space. This particular product is very much suited for the invitro fertilization [ph] business where you have precious samples obviously and what it really does -- the business here is about low cost, but also about our turnaround that you can do and our product is best in class for that. So we consider this in the range of our array technologies and this particular for the invitro fertilization [ph]. Didier, I wanted to ask about some of the sensitivities around the 30% incremental operating margin that you are looking for. If your growth ended up being only 3% or 4% or alternatively if it ended up being 6% or 7%, how would that incremental operating margin change? Yes I mean we have long talked about 30% to 40% range and which to take into account, kind of reasonable low end and reasonable high end in terms of volume increase. Right now we are shooting for even higher percentage this year adjusting for the synergies. So it is sensitive but a lot of the operating margin improvement comes from hard savings and the Agile Agilent program and really kind of sneaky kind of savings. So it would have to -- we would have to face really, really bad market situation, not to deliver on this 30%, and if the market is delivering as per our expectation, if we are delivering as per our expectations, we could go on fairly significantly higher than 30%. Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey, can you give us -- what the organic revenue growth comps are for the three different segments for the second quarter since we don’t have those on historical basis? The second quarter forecast, we expect currency to have an impact of -- negative impact on the year-over-year basis from about 7 points, which mostly it\\'s around 7 points an average. And besides that we expect pretty much all the businesses to grow on a currency adjusted basis about at the same level with LSAG, perhaps one percentage point over the rest of the other two businesses. So very much in line by business with the number that we’ve provided for the Company and LSAG a little bit higher and then the currency impact being 7% impacts pretty much all the businesses of about the same way, DGG little bit more and then ACG and other two beacons. As you go into my prepared remarks, you can tease out the actual reported numbers in Q1 in terms of the corporate by segment, and obviously we would expect to see an acceleration of the growth rate in our DGG business in Q2. Right, I\\'m just trying to get to the Q2 comp, just for modeling purposes on that. And I guess the -- looking short-term at the gross margin there was the big step up like 150 basis points sequentially and year-over-year and the Agilent CrossLab Group on the new breakout. Is that just simply driven by the 10% organic revenue growth is that the volume driven thing or there is something special that went on that margin? It\\'s mostly volume adjusted. It\\'s -- as lot of headwinds and tailwinds, but obviously with 10% revenue growth, it is a big impact. On the negative side DGG is pretty much impacted by the, I mean the currency also, but anyway it is mostly on the volume and then the some programs that market will in place and last year we spent a lot of time and resources and money to deliver the new CRM which will provide a lot more effectiveness to the organization. Mike perhaps can talk a little bit about it, but that is also factor that is we expect to deliver incremental operating margin to have deliver overtime. And Mark maybe you can jump in and could we talked earlier about some of the [indiscernible] even tried to do year and your compares given the synergies. I think that even gives us more positive comments around our performance Q1, but any additional color you can provide here? And it is -- if you will, it\\'s a compare that going forward it’s hard to look in the past and see how these two actually compare and what we -- as Didier has indicated we actually have made investments associated with putting a single system in place to run our business and services and that will actually bring us improvements in our operating. But as being said, the synergies is related the key element of this and we\\'ll continue to work on those operational elements. But in addition to that, we obviously see top-line growth is the area we’ll continue to push forward on to. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, just I\\' wondering this a follow-up on that question, So basically when you see SG&A given the investments you’ve made, the SG&A is up here but you’ve gotten good volume leverage of the gross profit margin line? Are you explaining that? Yes, I was talking about the loss of dynamics. One of the big dynamics that we have is really the way also we allocate our share of infrastructure services, the so called GIO, and because ACG is growing faster than the -- as been growing extremely fast, they got a big lump of that allocation including some of the cost synergies that we’ve talked about over and over. So…. For Mark, is there a -- for Mark, is there opportunity on the CrossLab in the CrossLab business, by that I mean either side of the consumable side? Are we under penetrated in any particular geography? Well, we\\'ve performed well most geographies. I would say our opportunities -- looking our consumables and the chemistry and China is still I think great growth opportunity for us. China in general from a cross line perspective, we’re starting to see customer respond to enterprise services much that we’ve seen in the Western markets and in fact we\\'re seen excellent growth in the pharma segment throughout Shanghai and Beijing. Okay. And then just one last question as a follow-up, you say -- have you seen any competitive disadvantage from a pricing standpoint with the strength in the dollar in particular maybe on the analytical chemical analysis side of the business where those products, food [ph] forensics, maybe there\\'s a little more competition there? Richard, this is Mike. I’ll take that question. Actually no I think it speaks to a couple of things, first of all the strength of the portfolio, but also the fact that with one exception most of the major competitors in this space are dealing the same FX wins. So nobody has any unique pricing power and our Japanese competitor is clearly trying to work on their margins as well. This is James Clark in for Ross. Most of my questions have been answered but I guess a quick one on the 22% margin target by 2017. I\\'m just wondering if you guys have said anything about sort of where you need to get from a segment margin perspective and specifically on the DGG side to hit that 22% If you look at the DGG business historically, this should be a strong double digit operating margin business. We’re going to be low double digits in Q2. So clearly getting to that north of 20% kind of operating margins for that business is part of the plan. And as you’ve heard from Jacob, it’s quite doable, a lot of confidence that as we have our remediation -- we move beyond our remediation efforts, we’ll have the trajectory we need in the business to attain those goals. Okay, and then just a quick one. No one asked but Japan down 6 during the quarter. I know funding has been constrained. We’ve heard some other peers talk about this. But just wondering when you sort of expect to see some clarity there and are you seeing the same dynamics as the peers or is there something specific to Agilent that’s going on in Japan right now? As you may know, I’ve spent 5.5 years of my life in Japan. So I\\'m always a little bit biased in terms of my view on Japan but if you look at what’s unique about Agilent is our position in that marketplace relative to the competition. Number two, right behind -- with obviously some other leading in that marketplace. So I think we’re seeing some of the same currency challenges that our competitors see in this space. And obviously we’re waiting for some of the -- for the budgeting discussions to conclude and get relief. Although you can’t see it in the currency results, because the currency has been such a huge impact in the most recently reported quarter. We believe we\\'re actually making some traction in that marketplace, particularly back in the discussion around services and consumables in our CrossLab site. So we often think about markets in terms of instruments, new instruments in the capital market side or capital budget side of things. But that’s been a source of strength for us. But you just can’t see it right now in the numbers given the overwhelming impact of currency. Most questions have been answered. I just have a clarification on the Diagnostics and Genomics business. It sounds like you are assuming a rebound, including on the revenue side not just the operating margin in the quarters ahead. Can you maybe help us understand what are the actions that have been completed that give you the confidence you can do that and that its turning and what still needs to be done? I guess what are the milestones that you were looking for to see the rebound? So Jacob, why don’t you comment on some of the things that are going on, on the manufacturing side relative to the 40% and what’s going on with the technology side. So thanks for the question Miro and as we also alluded to before, the main reason for our challenges on the operating profit and the revenue side in Q1 was due to some manufacturing challenges we had on our nucleic acid businesses, both genomics business and the nucleic acid solution division. Those have both been dissolved within the quarter and with that we expect to see us coming back to an on-situation in 2Q again. Well, if you look at the profitability we had in Q1 and then we’ve been fairly explicit in terms of our expectations for Q2 to low double digit profitability in Q2. So I think you can perhaps model off those vectors. Okay, thanks. And perhaps I missed it but maybe comment a little bit on the gross margin as well as R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales for the new Agilent, apart from the operating margin I guess. I\\'m not seeing explicit breakdown in the release and how those trended for the new Agilent ex Keysight? Yes. We did not provide the breakdown. We provide an EPS guidance and that we don’t provide the whole -- the full P&L. Clearly with the kind of growth that we expect you would think that our OpEx as a percentage of revenue will come down over time. Our gross margin are going up not just because of the revenue but also because of the actions that we are taking, many actions that are taking. But we don’t provide more granular detail for the guidance. Thank you. I\\'m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to hand the conference back over to the Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, Siad and thank you everybody joining us today. We appreciate you joining our call and if you have any questions, please give us a call at IR. Thank you. Bye, bye. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\\'s conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Agilent Technologies Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. I’d now like to turn the call over to your host, Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Patrick. And welcome everyone to Agilent\\'s fourth quarter conference call for fiscal year 2014. With me are Bill Sullivan, Agilent CEO; Mike McMullen, President, Chief Operating Officer and CEO-Elect; and Didier Hirsch, Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Fred Strohmeier, President of Agilent’s Life Sciences and Diagnostics Group; and Mark Doak, Senior Vice President of Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. There - while there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. You will find an investor presentation, along with revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today\\'s comments by Bill, Mike and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent including Keysight Technologies reported Q4 revenues of $1.81 billion, operating margin of 20.7% and earnings per share of $0.88. Keysight Technologies discussed their performance and outlook in a separate call earlier today. Accordingly, the rest of the numbers we will share today deal exclusively with Agilent’s performance in Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets. New Agilent reported fourth -- record fourth quarter revenues and orders. Revenue of $1.04 billion increased 3% versus last year, orders of $1.15 billion were up 5% over year ago, operating margin was 20.4%, book-to-bill was 1.1. In a moment, Mike and Didier will discuss the details of the Q4 performance and outlook for the new Agilent. However, I\\'d like to highlight three major accomplishments during the quarter. First, we completed the separation of the company. The Keysight and Agilent teams executed a flawless separation of the company without impacting the day-to-day business of either company. With the completion of the separation of the company, we have created two companies with greater strategic and management focus, with each company well-positioned for growth and long-term shareholder value in their respective markets. Second, during the quarter, Agilent retired an additional $500 million of debt, to maintain our leverage at a level consistent with our current investment grade rating. Third, we named a new CEO. In September, we announced that Mike McMullen had been named Agilent’s President, Chief Operating Officer and CEO-Elect. Mike will become CEO on March 18, 2015, the day of the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting. With the separation now complete, this is the perfect time to name the new CEO for the new Agilent. Mike and I are working to ensure the transition is smooth and seamless to the organization, customers and investors. Thanks, Bill. I’d like to share some of the details behind the quarter’s results. To reiterate, LDA or new Agilent’s fourth quarter revenues came in at $1.04 billion, or 3% growth year-over-year. Unfavorable currency, lower NMR revenues and late orders drove the difference from August’s guidance of $1.08 billion at the midpoint. As a reminder, in October, we announced our exit from the NMR instrument business. We are no longer taking NMR instrument orders and our current backlog will ship in 2015. Excluding NMR and currency effects, each having a negative 1 percentage point impact on reported growth, revenues grew 5% and orders grew 8% compared to a year ago. Now, turning to results by end market and growth on a reported basis. Within the Life Sciences and Applied markets, Pharma/Biotech was up 5%, driven by equipment refreshes from large and mid-size pharma customers, and continued specialty pharma demand. Life Sciences Research or academia and government was up 4% again this quarter, driven by improved government spending in the U.S. and China. Government spending particularly in the U.S. and China contributed to growth in Forensics up 6%, Food Testing up 4% and Environmental up 2% over year ago. Chemical and Energy revenues remained relatively flat, growing 1%. Pressure from reduced crude oil and natural gas prices, and continued softness in the industrial market slowed demand. Turning to Clinical and Diagnostics, revenues grew 1%, with solid demand for genomics products related to cancer applications and Mass spec for therapeutic monitoring offset by lower Pathology revenues. Geographically, economic recovery and government spending continued to drive growth in the Americas, up 6%. Asia excluding Japan grew 5%. We saw low single-digit growth from China, led by Life Science Research, Environmental and Food Testing. Europe was flat in the quarter. Continued strength in Eastern Europe and the Middle East was offset by softness in Western Europe. Japan declined 6% due to currency, but grew modestly on a local currency basis, primarily in Applied Markets. Turning to the business segments within LDA, Life Sciences and Diagnostics Group revenues grew 2%, while orders were up 3%. Excluding NMR, revenues were up 4% and orders were up 6%, with strong growth across LDG’s portfolio except pathology. Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5%, down 170 basis points from last year, but up 180 basis points from the previous quarter. Excluding the impact of NMR and FDA incremental expenses, LDG operating margin would have been 20% in Q4. Our Life Sciences team introduced a number of key new products in the past quarter. The 1290 Infinity II LC System sets a new benchmark in analytical, instrument and laboratory efficiency. OpenLAB CDS, Chromatography Data System, will fully support 1290 Infinity II LC System and provides one of the most comprehensive software control systems in the industry. We introduced ClearSeq AML, which is the first in line of NextGen sequencing panels developed for cancer research. And our new family of Sure Select Focused Exome products provides the most comprehensive and high performance NGS solution for post natal research on high throughput and benchtop sequencers. Turning to the chemical analysis group, revenues grew 5% while orders were up 8%. Operating margin for the quarter was strong at 24.5% flat a year ago and up 120 basis points from Q3. Our chemical analysis team also had a number of key new product introductions, including a new 7010 Triple Quad GCMS and 7200 GC/Q - TOF which expands pesticide screening beyond the capabilities of any other GC/Q - TOF System. We strengthened our industry-leading atomic Spectroscopy portfolio with the launch of the Agilent’s 5100 ICP-OES. This sets a new standard for optical emission spectroscopy and has been extremely well received by the market. Among its many innovations, analysis can be run 55% faster using 50% less gas per sample than competitive systems. In addition, the design changes have led to a 20 percentage point gross margin improvement over the previous product. As we launched the new Agilent and enter the new fiscal year, we have free focus areas for the company. Grow organically at the high-end of the market, aggressively expand operating margins, deploy capital for long-term shareholder value. First, we will focus on sustaining share growth within the core analytical lab. We will continue to bring innovative new offerings to the marketplace and expand our lab-wide services and consumables with a truly differentiated customer experience. We will leverage this strength in Analytical Lab to drive growth in the fast-growing genomics, clinical research and diagnostics markets. Second, we will focus on aggressively growing our adjusted operating margins with our portfolio and order fulfillment transformation programs. We will leverage SG&A and R&D investments, and reduce cost dis-synergies resulting from the separation of Keysight. Keep in mind that fiscal 2015 is a transition year for Agilent. Year one cost dis-synergies are the highest following the company separation. And NMR and FDA remediation work will continue to weigh on our results. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I have the highest confidence in our ability to meet Agilent’s long-term operating goals. Third, we will deploy capital for long-term shareholder value with expected return of $500 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2015. This includes a combination of cash dividends, approximately $135 million in opportunistic share buybacks. Turning to guidance, Agilent’s revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 are expected to range from $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion or 2.2% reported growth or 4.9% core growth at the midpoint. We expect first quarter earnings per share from $0.39 to $0.43. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range from $4.12 billion to $4.18 billion and earnings per share from $1.68 to $1.78. Thank you for being on the call. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent’s financial results and guidance. Thank you, Mike and hello, everyone. Bill and Mike have already covered Q4 orders, revenues and EPS. I will add that LDA’s 20.4% operating margin is in line with our volume-adjusted midpoint guidance. Also, please note that we spent an incremental $9 million in Q4 to address the FDA warning letter. Without this expense and assuming we had already exited the NMR related business, therefore saving $15 million on an annualized basis, LDA’s Q4 operating margin would be about 22%. Finally, we redeemed $500 million of debt in Q4 and generated $166 million in operating cash flow. This is lower than traditional for three main reasons. First, we paid $80 million for the redemption of the 2017 notes and also prepaid the current interest on the note. Second, pre-separation expenses amounted to $70 million. Third, we paid $41 million in taxes related to the spin. Also note, that we booked mostly non-cash charges related to the exit of the NMR-related business of $68 million. I’ll now turn to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. Our fiscal year ‘15 revenue guidance of $4.12 billion to $4.18 billion assumes the economy will pick up moderately in the second half of our fiscal year. At midpoint, our year-over-year growth will be 2.5% on a reported basis but 4.9% on a core basis, the difference due to currency. We project fiscal year ‘15 EPS to range from $1.68 to $1.78 with a midpoint of a $1.73 as per our October 17 guidance. As you update yours model for fiscal year ‘15, please consider the following, First, annual salary increases will be less effective December 1, 2014. Second, stock-based compensation would be about $65 million. As we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense would be about $26 million. Third, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth, net interest expense is forecasted at $63 million and other income at $29 million. About $26 million of other income comes from services billed to Keysights, $12 million for IT services in the first half and $14 million for ongoing rental income. And as we have previously communicated, the corresponding expenses are reflected in operating profit. So you will need to increase the reported operating profit with the value of those services billed to Keysight if you want to make year-over-year comparison of our operating profit. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $500 million in capital to shareholders, including $135 million in dividends and $365 million in opportunistic buybacks. The buybacks will occur from time to time on the open market with consideration given to our stock price. Seventh, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed diluted share count of 340 million shares. But we could achieve lower diluted share count of about 335 million shares, would we execute the buyback program in full. Eight, we expect operating cash flow of $600 million and capital expenditures of $120 million. The operating cash flow reflects post separation expenses of $50 million and separation related taxes of $40 million, both will be pro forma. Finally, moving to the guidance for fourth quarter, we expect Q1 revenues of $1.02 billion -- of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion and EPS of $0.39 to $0.43. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% year-over-year, or 4.9% on a core basis, the difference again, as a result of currency. As customary, Q1 EPS is still negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. Hi. This is [Ryan Burke] [ph] filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. It appears as though that China pressures haven’t completely subsided despite the low single-digit growth in the quarter. From your commentary, it sounds like it outpaced your expectations, but you sounded very positive on the spending environment in China in the quarter. Can you talk about what are you seeing in the marketplace, as well as what relative growth from China is baked into your current 2015 guidance? Brian, this is Mike. I will field the question on China. So, I guess, I think your read through in the commentary is correct. We saw low single-digit revenue growth, but we are encouraged by the overall strength of the order performance in the quarter with 7%, 8% order growth for the quarter. And what we saw happening in China was a return to levels of improved, albeit still subdued government spending, which fueled our growth in life sciences research, environmental testing and food businesses. Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe one high-level question. So over the past few years you have invested pretty materially above your peer group in terms of R&D for the LDA segment. How should we assess the related return on investment looking forward and more specifically where do you expect to pick up share and at what pace? I know you mentioned in some presentations early in the year, you are beginning to leverage some of the R&D investments in 2015. At what point should we think about R&D starting to become maybe a lower percentage of sales? Thank you. Just a follow-up commentary and the question, again, this is Mike. Relative to the comments you saw in my narrative in my early comments, we talked about leveraging the investments we’ve made in R&D. In particular, we have invested quite heavily to build our portfolio out in the life sciences space, and we\\'ve also invested to build out a sales channel, focused on our life sciences’ customer base. So you would expect that we continue to be able to outgrow the market in these parts of the portfolio. In particular, I would tell you that we had real strong strength in our separations, our chromatography and mass spectrometry business in the fourth quarter across liquid separations, gas phase separations and the metals analysis side of the business, ICP-MS. So, I think those core product categories would continue to fuel above market growth and has been a recipient to a lot of our investments that we talked about earlier. Hey. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the leverage question. As we are thinking about operating margins, either Mike or Bill, can you maybe just talk about, give little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin leverage, particular on the order fulfillment and portfolio aspect and do you in fact expect SG&A leverage in ‘15 as well? Yeah. So, I think, this is Mike. There is three drivers behind the overall operating margin improvement and as you may have seen already, we committed to a three point operating margin improvement over the next three years, hitting 22% by 17%. And as we\\'ve also indicated, FY ‘15 is a significant transition year for us in terms of working all the synergies but also significant in terms of underlying improvement to the operating performance of the company. And the three key components of our margin improvement plan. One is the portfolio transformation that I highlighted earlier in my comments. And one example of that is the new ICP-OES, which through new product design and capability has a 20 point better gross margin position than its predecessor product. So you will continue to see us coming to market and driving, not only topline growth with improved offerings, but also a better margin structure just based on the inherent design and platform design of the product. The order fulfillment transformation program is still centered on what you saw at the March Analyst Meeting last year, where Henrik is driving overall consolidation of manufacturing sites and more importantly a drive towards lower cost of our supply chain, as we have moved our manufacturing into low-cost parts of the world, such as Penang, Malaysia where the next phase of that program is to start to move our material supply chain, which as you know, represents actually a higher element of cost of the manufacture products. And the third aspect of the plan is SG&A and R&D. R&D cost structure leverage and you will start to see in FY ‘15, particularly on the SG&A line, as we leverage that and it starts to decline as percent of overall revenue, again, adjusting for the synergies will absorb in year one. Okay. And in the comments you called out some of the pathology headwinds, can you maybe just talk a little bit about when you think those bottom out and how much of the headwind was impacting the quarter? If you don’t mind, I think I will pass this question over to Fred. I’m so sorry. I’m going to pass this over to Fred Strohmeier and Fred, the question was related -- the question was related to the pathology business. When did you see the headwinds perhaps turning on that business, Fred? Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think in pathology, we are seeing at the moment a flat revenue, closer if you look through the last two quarters and I think particularly in Q4, we have a tough compare in Europe. I think we are seeing a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe and due to healthcare reforms, lower investment and also consolidation of lapse and also in AsiA - Pacific, stricter regulatory controls. And internally as Mike already mentioned, we are seeing also some reflection of our FDA program on the revenues we are seeing in Q4. But we are optimistic that we are able to turn the situation around for next year. The companion diagnostic is doing quite well, so it’s growing nicely, OEM is on plan, OEM and other reagent partnership is on plan. And what we are hearing from our customers in the fields concerning on this and our products is pretty encouraging. Okay. And then lastly, you left M&A out of the capital deployment discussion, any reason you wouldn’t consider tuck-ins that became available? Yeah. Our focus really in FY ‘15 is really to launch the new Agilent Technologies, really go after some of the operational opportunities. We are improving I discussed earlier. And as you heard from Didier and myself, we do have a plan to return capital to the shareholders this year. Good afternoon. Thank you. A question for you on capital allocation. There was obviously a focus on shareholder returns, as it relates to repurchasing dividend but wondering if you can comment a little bit about your interest and appetite for M&A. if we look across the portfolio, there are some gaps. My view particularly in diagnostics and genomics where you theoretically deploy some investment dollars to round out your offering, so just curios, how are you thinking about M&A in the near to medium-term? I will go ahead and take those questions. So, as I mentioned earlier, we’ve made a sizeable bet in our Dako acquisition and we think it has a tremendous amount of promise working through some short-term operational challenges. So our focus right now for FY15 is not to pursue large M&A but really to focus on -- realize the potential of the acquisition we have made. Great. And then if I could just ask one question on the shorter-term basis regarding some of the regional trends. I think you mentioned some softness in, I think Europe. And then in food safety, I think it was the mid-single-digit growth rate. And curious on the latter item in particular, it seems like in China, the industry in general this quarter has seen a little bit of pressure, mostly tied to some reshuffling in the government, though hopefully be a transient issue. So I was just wondering if number one, you share that view on China, and then secondly in Europe, can you maybe give us a mark-to-market on how that trended at the end of the quarter? Thank you. Sure, Isaac. So let me make some comment first on China. Just back about six weeks ago from visit at China and how the opportunity to kind of see firsthand and draw my own conclusions on what’s happening in the marketplace, and I think a characterization is spot on in terms of there\\'s been a significant reshuffling of ministries within the food safety arena. And I think it\\'s a temporal slowdown that we’ve seen in this space. And as we pointed to an earlier call, this actually had a pretty significant pull down in terms of overall order growth rate. We did see in the fourth quarter some initial signs that we maybe transitioning to some higher levels of growth in the food space in China. I would caution it is still subdued but is trending in the right direction. So I think this is clearly an area of great interest in Chinese government, but they also want to make sure that they\\'re investing efficiently. And I think they had drawn the conclusion they had way too many ministries kind of overlapping one another in terms of jurisdictions. So they are getting themselves better organized, but I do believe you\\'ll start to see a return to growth and investment in the food space. I would also add that the prospects for investment in the environmental testing in life science research are also bullish longer-term in China. The pull-through on Europe is continued sluggish conditions in Western Europe. But as we report the number, our European business also includes what we call the idea or Eastern Europe part of the world as well as the Middle East. And despite some of the political noise that you see in terms of what\\'s going on in the Middle East, our business is holding up quite well there and has continued to be a area of strength for us. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Didier on the warning letter for Dako manufacturing with the $9 million this quarter, is that issue now behind you from a P&L perspective or should we look for some of that to carry over into 2015? No, we are planning in, in our guidance. We are including some further expenses throughout 2015, obviously from a lower -- going lower after Q1. But the expenses will be flat in Q1 and potential in the Q2 from the Q4 run rate that we have. Situation in Denmark is complicated. There have been quite a few warning letters more than us inside of Denmark. And as a result of that, we\\'ve had to source resources from other parts of Europe and even from the U.S. to help out on the mitigation. And so the expenses will continue into Q1. Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up, wondering if you can comment on manufacturing and how that factors into gross margin improvement? I guess if you look across next year to with what you have going on, how much of gross margin gain that you think you\\'ll see is expected to come from what you might consider fix for a particular issue, whether it would be NMR or Dako versus what you just come from more opportunities to become incrementally more efficient? Yes, it’s a great question. And this is Mike. And that’s why I pointed to three aspects of the programs under operating margin, the supply chain transformation which you’re referring to, the portfolio transformation and then our rationalization and leverage of SG&A and R&D investments. I think it\\'s probably legal spread across the three. It’s a little bit hard to quantify. Hi, good afternoon, guys. So can you just give a little sense on the order pacing? You talked a little bit about some late orders and such. And just give a sense for how if the NMR announcement also had any impact on any of the other legacy spectroscopy businesses? Hey, Ross, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. And to maybe address the last part of your question first. No impact at all on the other aspects of the portfolio growth rates from the NMR announcement. In fact, we had a really fantastic quarter in terms of topline order growth in our spectroscopy business fueled by introduction of the new products I mentioned to you earlier. In terms of the overall order flow through the quarter, we were actually quite pleased with how the quarter finished. Orders coming in higher than forecast, and so always bit hard to project exactly what your win loss ratios maybe in a particular deal situation, but obviously we are pleased with the win loss ratios where we’re higher than we had forecast. And new products were above targeted ramp rates. And then as I mentioned earlier, the China orders were solid at 8%. So I think there was a geographic dimension as well to our order flow. Great. And maybe if you guys could just give us sort of a first flush of where the pro forma balance sheet is now, obviously a number of moving parts in the quarter in terms of debt paid out and how think about the optimized kind of leverage ratio for this business? Well, right now, as I said in my comments that the leverage in the company is consistent with our present credit rating and we feel very comfortable with where we are between BBB and BBB+. And I will remind all of the investors in the last five years, we have returned 62% of our free cash through dividends and share repurchases. So the framework of where we are is I think very, very solid and we have a proven track record of tax effectively returning excess cash to our shareholders. Thanks. I was just hoping maybe because we didn’t get any pro forma balance sheet, et cetera. If you could just give us a sense of where kind of the net cash or the leverage is just on a rough dollar basis? Absolutely. So for Newedge loans, we have about a little bit over $2.2 billion in cash and $1,650 million in that. And as Bill mentioned, our adjusted leverage is about little over 2.1, 2.2 adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio. Yes, 80% of the cash is trapped overseas. We have about $400 million in the U.S. The rest is trapped overseas. Hi, thank you. I wanted to return to the diagnostics business for just a second. You guys have forecasted that you expect that market to grow 8% to 10%. This year you certainly didn’t get there. And obviously there are some issues happening, including the warning letter but also some things that are out of your control on a regulatory front and reimbursement front. What gives you the confidence that you can get back to that high-single-digit growth rate which I guess is kind of what it would take to get to the appropriate hurdle rates that you need on a Dako acquisition? Thank you. I think this is a very good question. I think first of all, I believe, we will get back to the goals by the promise we had made over the last couple of quarters to automate the pathology business, I think we are really good on the consumables piece, I think the automation will be key of it -- will be key, so Omnis will be one of the element. And we have seen a couple of really good responses in the meantime. One of the biggest regions just as an example in Denmark has picked Omnis as the prime diagnostic tool in order to cancel diagnostic, number one. Number two, I think we are also making really progress with our new products we have introduces like the SureFISH, which has been growing in this quarter about over 100% really significant. We have a couple of new products on the market like the ClearSeq AML, this is leukemia cancer diagnostic tool, which is looking at cancer variations and cancer research that is the new HER2 FISH-IQ on Omnis available in the meantime, which allows another set of cancer diagnostic test. So from the product perspective, I think, we are fueling the pipeline in order to grow the business overtime. Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question for Didier. When did those transitional services for Keysight and how exactly do they wind down post 2015? So the IT services will wind down by the end of -- before the end of our fiscal year -- first half of fiscal year ’15, so by April. And then the rental services, those are about $15 million and those are ongoing. And by the way, Keysight, we are also buying from Keysight an equivalent of the $15 million also of rental services. I’ll remind you the way we want about splitting our real estate is more less balance, one of the two companies ended up being the landlord and in each side there was one of the two companies ended up being the landlord and subleasing some of the space to the other company if needed. And the two things offset each other will be receiving of about $15 million of rental income and we’ll pay about $15 million of rental expense to Keysight. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if you could build on, some of the commentary that you made here on the call, regarding some of the new product launch traction? Could you give us a sense in fiscal ’15, not necessarily byproduct, but maybe with the focus on geographies or customer types, where future product launches will be targeted most directly? Yes. Sure, Steve. So this is Mike. I’ll provide some color on some of the instrumentation around our separations and mass spectrometry offerings, and then, Fred, I’d ask you to jump in and talk little bit about some of the diagnostics and genomics products that come out. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in our core liquid chromatography, our leading platform the 1290 was replaced by an even stronger platform the 1290 Infinity II series. This allows the capture opportunities in Pharma, Biotech and across the implied markets space. So this is a broad-based tool that will go across all of our key end markets. The GC Triple Quad, the GC/Q - TOF, the mass spectrometry products that discussed are heavily focused towards food safety, pesticide analysis, environmental testing, but also increasing adoption in the Life Sciences Research arena as well. And then, finally, the new ICP-OES is targeted toward the Environmental, Pharma and Material Science space and in terms of -- that would be in terms of the end market usage. Obviously, we’re encouraged by what we saw as an uptick in growth in China because these products will play very strongly into this geography, as well as replace the market in the U.S. and Europe. And Fred, maybe some additional comments on the LDG side? Yeah. Maybe, I just made a couple of comments on the new products on the pathology side. I think, just what I want to mention is, once we are improving the situation around the FDA letter, that by itself will stimulate some further growth, number one. Number two, I believe it is very important that we are launching products in where we are using the synergy with other things we have in our product line, which are the genomics product. But I think putting those things in a meaningful way together that we’re creating work flows which make a difference to the customer is one of the themes for next year. But I think a couple of those things we have started launching a new PCR, qPCR instrumentation, which will be in this market. We have launched some editing tools of synthetic biology or genome editing tools for synthetic biology the CRISPR/Cas solution, which come to the markets and is introduced to the market, which will pick up next year. Thanks. Very helpful. And then one for Didier on currency. Historically, the company has had a pretty effective natural hedge, so the translation from the topline into the P&L was relatively muted. Is that still true for new Agilent? And if not, are there any currencies that we should look out for as potentially having an impact on margins? Thanks so much. Yeah. It is still true. We have only one of the smaller flow through I would say of longer peer group, about -- with the current mix about 20% to 25%, so for reduction of a dollar in the topline $0.20 to $0.25 impact on the bottomline. It is not zero, even though we are structurally heads because we have a presence, well right presence. And we also have our financial hedging, but the financial hedging doesn’t provide one full year. So it really covers 100% of the coming quarter and then 75%, 50%, 25%. But overall, we believe, we are properly hedged knowing that the hedges, the financial hedges cannot really cover you forever. And then in terms of the mix, it’s clearly -- our flow through is even smaller in Europe for example where we have a strong presence with only 10% versus Japan where we have less of the presence. And therefore, an impact on the topline will not be totally offset by an impact to OpEx and cost of sales. So there is a mix difference, but on the present mix, it\\'s about 20% to 25% flow through. Good morning. As I do the back out on the capital redeployment, you\\'re talking maybe 5 million decline in shares outstanding, which I think implies $165 million share comp number. Is that share comp number a little high because of the spin? And what should that share comp number be? The math is a little bit complicated, but the speed is pretty much has no impact on our share count. What you have to consider every year is that the share count evolves because of grants of RSUs or long-term performance plans or exercise of stock options or the employee stock purchase plan. It also changes with the changes in valuation of our stock price or our TSR versus our peer group. And then we do buyback shares, so it’s a little bit complicated but no impact from the split. Didier earlier in the call, you had mentioned that you kind of were talking about a 22% pro forma operating margin net-net. Do you think you’ll be talking 22% and higher same discussion as FY ‘15 rolls out? So no -- Mike mentioned where we are extremely committed to improving our operating margins to 23% by 2017. But this is three years plan. Q4’s operating margin is always stronger because it’s where we have to realize the highest volume and the number that I have provided excluded the impact of NMR. I assume the NMR is exited and as Mike mentioned, we want to exit NMR until the end of 2015 and also it’s assumed it’s basically backed out the expenses related to addressing the FDA issues. And as we have also talked, we all spend money in 2015 to continue to spend money to address those issues. And last Mike, what did you see or do at chemical analysis that you think you can do with the rest of Agilent? Thanks Paul. Appreciate the question. And I think its really -- Bill and I have talked about this as well, which is to really take a view of the focus bets that you are going to make, be very selective on the bets you make. And I try to highlight a few of those earlier. And then drive an operational excellence around those focused bets and then couple that with what we’ve done historically which was meaningful M&A in the variant deal, for example. But I really think it’s all about picking right focus bets getting the organization aligned on those focus areas then drive in operational excellence around the activities. Hi Bill. Hi Mike. Hi Didier. Let me just start with the question on the academic markets. It seems like you are seeing some improvement there for the second quarter interval. I was wondering if you could comment if you’re seeing the funds flow in the second half of the year, the calendar year? And you do have unlike others in the industry, you have had the month of October in your quarter. So I am wondering if it is too early to speculate on a possible year end budget flush? Yeah, this is Mike. I’ll jump in with my perspective then Fred, feel free to add your view as well. But I think the answer to your question, Miro, I think it’s too early to call a year end budget flush, if you will. We were encouraged by the results but keep in mind the U.S. government closes off at September a lot of their spending. And we also had a closing of our own sales cycle at the end of October, which sometimes doesn\\'t always mimic the spending patterns of our customers. So while encouraged, I think it’s too early to call a significant global recovery here in this segment. And Fred, I don’t know what you are hearing from your field teams. Yeah. Our field team is pretty consistent with what I\\'m hearing. I think academia and government markets remain soft even so we are seeing a gradual improvement. And the result we are seeing at the moment are impacted predominantly by NMR as such because this is going mainly through the academia and government market, we see a funding growth in China as Mike pointed out the results are showing that. So this is certainly impacting the growth in next year. We see a stable funding in SAPK. Japan is weak and maybe remains weak given in all of the missing stimulus from last year. You are seeing demand in HPLC, GC-MS and LCMS, what’s really hard to sub checks and this is probably driving some of the growths next year, cell biology, stem cell research and next generation sequencing. These are areas which will drive some of the growth. NaH is spending about plus 2%. This year, hopefully, we see something like that next year as well. Europe already, we heard about it, very tight. And if you look to the distribution of the countries, it’s a completely mixed bag. China reorganizing even so, I talked about the growth is reorganizing the academia of the Chinese Academy of Science, which certainly also will have some impact on the spending pattern and we talked about Japan already. Okay. Thank you. And secondly on the gross margin it did decline slightly year-over-year, I was wondering if you could help us understand the puts and takes? And for the neoadjuvant going forward, despite the dys-synergies that you have this coming year, can you drive margin, gross margin expansion in ‘15? Didier, why don’t I make some initial comments and then you can build on it. So if you look our year-on-year gross margin, I believe the FDA remediation work is part of our cost to sales number. I also would point to a change in our overall business model. We haven’t talked about in this call yet. But with the creation of the CrossLab services, consumer informatics group, you are going to hear me talk a lot more about what’s going on across the enterprise in our laboratories and our services business is becoming an increasingly larger part of the company. It’s got a very nice operating margin story. But as the mix changes, it does have a different gross margin structure relative to instrument business. So when you look at just at the gross margin line, you are going to see a mix effect of the increasing portion of our business coming from services. Didier, I don’t know if there is something else you would add to that? Yeah. I mean, in terms of the gross margin, I will say, I mean, the other negatives you mentioned are the dis-synergies and as we already talked about the impact of currency on a year-over-year basis. And so that would be the main reasons why on a gross margin bases, on an adjusted operating margin basis, we are going to see some slight improvement year-over-year even with all those negative, all those headwinds. But on the gross margin, it’s going to be slightly down year-over-year. Yeah. I don’t know whether I really clearly answered the other part of your question. This is Mike again, which is we do see, we have the ability to improve our overall gross margins and move forward because obviously we are going to get the FDA remediation work behind us. We talked earlier about the new products coming out and as well as our supply chain transformation. So we do believe that we can improve our overall gross margins, but we are also working through some one-time transition challenges around NMR, the FDA industry, the separation, if you will to synergies. Currency has a particularly big impact on gross margins because it’s offset by the lower operating expenses. So when I said, $400 million, you have net-net $20 million to $25 million impact to the bottom line. The impact to the gross margin is more significant and then this offset in OpEx. Yes. Good afternoon. Mike, could you just talk for a minute or two about the petrochem energy chemical markets? I think you mentioned they were up 1% in the quarter and quite frankly all year, they’ve been low single-digit. But maybe, what\\'s your assessment there as we move into ’15, are we in early innings of our commodity driven down cycle there in demand, or were orders and orders better in the fourth quarter here heading into ‘15? Yeah. Richard, thanks for the question. And this has been a -- I have to say, a segment of the market has been quite curious for me over the last several quarters because at the very macro level, you would expect to have seen stronger business here as you think about particularly United States where you’ve had lower feedstock cost coming down and some of our major customers actually taking about investment in the plant and infrastructure and new capacity in the U.S. So, I think what we saw in this most recent fiscal year, and a continuation of the quarter was continued challenges in industrial side of the Chinese economy where we haven\\'t seen as much capacity been out of that we had seen in prior quarters. I believe the real wild card and this is why I think we’ll start to see some moderate return to growth in FY ‘15 in this segment is the replacement market in the private sector particularly in the U.S. The industry outside of the exploration side is actually finding itself much more profitable, the age of the assets and equipment has really moved up over the last several years. So we think that the combination of the aged assets plus the lot of our customers, who are going to need to move on to new data system because of the obsolescent by Microsoft of several of their core operating systems. I think this would point to an improved replacement market in FY ‘15 albeit I said it’s been much slower to develop than I had anticipated. Okay. All right. And when I look at the CAG business and LDG business heading into ‘15 and I know the core growth is kind of -- at the midpoint is 4.9%, call it 5%. Is the LDG business expected to grow above that number and CAG kind of low single digits. So how do you see the mix by end market playing to that 5% core growth number? Richard, a great question. I think you really picked up the insights we were trying to share on the call today which was the strength of the underlying core business you strip out such as the business such as NMR. So Fred and I haven’t compared exact growth rate assumptions between the two segments. But I would say in general, we’d expect both to enjoy growth. But we’d expect to see high levels of growth in the life sciences side of the house just given what we seem to be a stronger backdrop of pharma, biopharma, some government spending and just our overall share position in those segments. And again also keep in mind that part of the story here isn’t just instruments and technology, part of the story here is the services business. And in fact, after Fred makes a few comments, I’ll invite Mark, you’re not going to get away from this call without making some comments on your first call to talk about what’s going on the pharma space, life sciences relative to the services business. So Fred, if you would, maybe just add a little bit additional color. Yeah. I mean, the pharma industry is only at the moment growing in the area of around 3% to 5%. I mean we are seeing a lot of instrument refresh as Mike explained it out. That’s particular in pharma, a huge opportunity for services and consumables. The most growing segment within that is at the moment the biological -- biologics, which is growing about 18% and the overall size is about 20% of the entire pharmaceutical market. I think we are well-positioned with all products. Mike has just highlighted before our core products in LC, LC MS. So I think this is fueling the growth. The refresh in this business I think it’s not as homogeneous as ours. I mean, Americas has a difficult compare because we had a good business last year. I think Europe is picking up at this point in time also on generics. So overall, I think this is one of the drivers and academy and government you talked about before, I think this is also certainly slightly picking up. So from that perspective, this should fuel across the next year. And Mark, just closing off this question, just your view on what\\'s going on in the services side in pharma in particular? Sure, Mike. And as you alluded to, I think we see both the areas across CAG and LDK being strong, but in the pharma area in particular continued strong demand for our enterprise services and those particularly targeted at helping customers with operational efficiencies. And to that end also, if you add the consumables side of it too, a continued focus on our biocolumns and sample prep area that I think heading into next year we will continue to service well. Thanks. Does the op profit contribution of flow through today to Agilent’s P&L, is it north of 20% on the services side? I don’t know whether we’ve disclosed the actual operating percentages externally, but I would just say we’re in the range of our instrument business. So it’s not a drag on company performance. You want to see us grow our business here. Okay. And then I am sorry one last question, the NMR business year-over-year in the fourth quarter, was there a revenue delta that was meaningful fourth quarter of \\'14 versus fourth quarter of \\'13? On a year-over-year basis, it’s about -- there a 22% reduction in revenue for the full year and on the quarterly basis, it was 49%. Hi. Good afternoon. It’s Rafael in for Derik and thanks for the questions. Just first on 2015 guidance, just wondering what the expectation for growth is by geography on the Americas, Europe, AsiA - Pac and China as well? Thanks. Rafael, this is Mike. Just make a few comments. I think you first of all saw in Didier’s narrative, he talked about an overall gradually improving economic environment in the second half of ’15, that’s sort of the backdrop behind my comments. What I’m just going to share with you at this general trend, I wouldn’t want to be able to present myself with being able to predict exactly the growth rates in every of the geographic markets. But the backdrop of our forecast beyond this gradually improving second half environment in ‘15 is we see an improving U.S., China and India, which we’ve not talked about today, continued weakness in Western Europe, Brazil and Japan. So what\\'s really driving this is the overall continuation of the improvements in the U.S., China and India marketplace. Okay. I appreciate that color. And just after exiting the NMR business, how should we think about the company\\'s portfolio of review strategy and whether the company\\'s planning on exiting on the other product lines in the near-term just thinking, I guess bigger picture of how content the company is with its existing portfolio? Thanks. Sure. Great question. As Paul asked me earlier, when we talked about the experience I had, on the chemical analysis group was, we always constantly reviewed where our portfolio was, was it meeting expectations, did we see a path for to a viable business. So that discipline that we’ve had in the prior years in the chemical analysis business that will be carried forward with the new Agilent. And I think you saw one example of that with our decision around NMR, which we really didn\\'t see a path forward to a viable attractive business for Agilent. I’m very satisfied and happy with the portfolio we have. But what I will commit to is a continued rigorous ongoing review of our portfolio relative to our expectations. Hi. Good afternoon. Just in terms of the NMR exit, can you frame that in terms of the duration of the topline impact and then also the cost too coming out of that business? The topline from 2015 will not be fundamentally much lower than really what we\\'ve seen in 2014 because we do have a big backlog, not just NMR business, but also the OEM business that we exited one year ago, we would say, we still have backlog to flush for big part of 2015. And then, the bottomline impact we have indicated that it is on an annualized basis its about $15 million, next year it will be about $10 million opening profit improvements because of the exit and $15 million in 2016. And then, in terms of the topline in 2016, are you -- and maybe even ’17, are you still going to be delivering orders there or? No, no. We are -- we will be done in 2015 with flushing the backlog and we are not taking any order. That’s an important build to Didier’s comments. We will retain the profitable NMR service business, both in terms of -- making sure we have the business continuity for our customers, as well as an attractive business segment for us as well. Yes. Good afternoon. Didier, just one question for you, in terms of the free cash flow guidance implies about $480 million of free cash flow? I think, going back to the Analyst Day, you kind of pointed to more like a $620 million number? Can you just walk us through what the factors are there in terms of the delta in the free cash flow outlook? Yeah. So, the $600 million of opening cash flow that we are projecting is after paying about $50 million of post-separation expenses and also $40 million of taxes related to the separation. So there is $90 million which will be pro forma, but there will be cash outlays in 2015. So really on the sustainable basis, you are talking $690 million. Yeah. Because it was excluding the one-time items, really it was -- the sustainable cash flow contributions and we talked about 15% of revenues on an ongoing basis of three years period, excluding those one-time separation related items. They are both separation related items. Okay. And one more on the NMR business, would you -- can you quantify the operating loss incurred from that business in ’14 for us? Well, what happens is it will be misleading because it includes a lot of costs now basically absorbed from the share allocated from the shared services, but what we have stated this -- the exit will basically improve operating profit by $10 million next year and $15 million in 2016. Thank you, Patrick. And thank you everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR and we\\'d like to wish you all a good day. Thank you. Ronald S. Nersesian - Executive Vice President, Chief Executive Officer of Electronic Measurement Group and President of Electronic Measurement Group Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Inc. Fiscal Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\\'s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Karen, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s Third Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2014. With me are: Bill Sullivan, Agilent President and CEO; Ron Nersesian, Keysight President and CEO; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be the Presidents of Agilent\\'s Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets, or LDA, businesses, Mike McMullen and Fred Strohmeier. Also joining from Keysight will be Neil Dougherty, CFO; and Guy Séné, Senior Vice President of Measurement Solutions and Worldwide Sales. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an investor presentation, along with revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today\\'s comments by Bill, Ron and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company and the separation of the Electronic Measurement business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Lastly, we expect this to be the final quarter in which we conduct a joint conference call for both Agilent and Keysight. We expect the company\\'s separation to be finalized in early November, after which Keysight will operate and report as an independent company. And now I\\'d like to turn the call over to Bill. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported third quarter revenues of $1.77 billion, an increase of 7% versus last year and above the high end of guidance. Orders of $1.74 billion were up 9% over a year ago. Adjusted earnings of $0.78 per share also exceeded the high end of guidance and increased 15% over last year. Operating margin was 19.2%, up 90 basis points from the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Both Keysight and LDA delivered on revenue and earnings commitments. In most end markets, we saw continued improvement and good order growth across both businesses. Our work to split the company continues to go very well. On August 1, Keysight began operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. We expect the separation of the company to be completed by early November as planned. Today, I will share performance highlights of LDA, or the life science, diagnostics and applied market businesses that comprise Agilent moving forward. Following my remarks, Ron will share performance highlights for Keysight. Finally, Didier will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\\'s overall financial results, as well as our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Turning to LDA. Third quarter revenues came in at $1.01 billion, up 6% over a year ago or 5% on a core basis. Orders grew 10% to $1.02 billion or 9% on a core basis. Operating margin was 19%, up 50 basis points from last year. In our Diagnostics and Clinical markets, revenue grew 6%, with strength in array CGH, target enrichment, as well as demand for pathology products in the U.S. and Europe. Revenue from analytical lab markets also grew 6% in Q3. We were pleased with the growth we saw across our instruments, services and consumables portfolio fueled by new offerings to the marketplace. Within the Life Science and Applied markets that make up Analytical Laboratories, Pharma/Biotech was up 8%, led by midsized and specialized Pharma customers. Life Sciences Research was up 4%, posting the best year-over-year growth in 2 years. Results were driven by increased government spending on capital equipment in the U.S. and Europe. Government spending also was the catalyst behind 16% growth in Environmental and 12% growth in Forensics. In Food, revenues were up 4% over last year as results in the U.S. and Europe were offset by the impact of the FDA restructuring in China. Chemical and Energy revenues were relatively flat, growing 1%, largely due to softer demand from China versus a year ago. Geographically, economic recovery and government funding drove growth in the Americas and Europe, up 6% and 8%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 4%. China continues to work through government agency reorganizations, which is resulting in a longer approval cycle. Turning to the business segments within LDA. Life Science and Diagnostics Group\\'s revenue grew 5%. Orders grew 11%, with broad strength across LDG products. Operating margin was almost 16%, down slightly from last year and up 260 basis points from last quarter. LDG introduced a number of new products in the quarter. One highlight was the 6495 LC Triple Quad Mass Spectrometer which provides higher sensitivity, robustness and reliability. Another highlight was the introduction of the IQFISH work flow for bone marrow and custom FISH service through Sure Design. Both FISH products provide high-quality results with significantly shorter turnaround times -- from 16 hours to 2.5 hours in the case of the IQFISH. LDG also signed a development and commercialization agreement with Merck & Co. for a companion diagnostics device, using Dako\\'s IHC solutions with Merck & Co.\\'s anti-PD-L1 cancer drug. In the Chemical Analysis Group, revenues and orders increased 8%. Operating margin was over 23%, up 180 basis points from a year ago. CAG announced the 5100 ICP-OES in July. The new product runs analyses 55% faster and uses 50% less gas per sample than competitive systems. The 5100 is suited to applications in Environmental, Food, Energy and Pharmaceutical markets. CAG\\'s recently introduced 7010 GC Triple-Quad Mass Spectrometer, targeted for the Food Safety market, lowers costs and improves ease of use compared to current high-resolution mass spec systems. The 7010 significantly strengthens Agilent\\'s market position with a range of pricing options, performance and productivity benefits. In July, the Cary 700 Universal Spectrophotometer was named a 2014 R&D 100 Award winner. The award recognizes the 100 most technically significant products introduced in the marketplace over the past year. This award marks the third consecutive year Agilent\\'s spectrophotometers have been recognized as R&D 100 Award winners. In 2013, the Agilent 8800 Triple Quad ICP-MS won the award and the Agilent 4100 Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrophotometer won in 2012. These awards demonstrate the benefit of our investment in spectroscopy. Looking forward to Q4, we expect mid single-digit growth across LDA as we continue to build on our order momentum, gain traction with new products and drive manufacturing cost reduction. We remain committed to creating shareholder value through: increasing our organic growth rate by leveraging Agilent\\'s strength in the analytical lab into the fast-growing genomics and diagnostic markets; continuing to differentiate through best-in-class tools, workflow solutions and customer experience; and finally, expanding operating margins and return on invested capital consistent with our long-term operating model. Turning to guidance, LDA revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 are expected to be between $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion or 6.2% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 21.1%. For the full year, we expect LDA revenue in a range from $4.07 billion to $4.09 billion, with operating margins at the midpoint of 19%. Didier will provide additional details in his remarks. Thank you for being on the call. I will now turn it over to Ron to talk about Keysight and the Electronic Measurement business. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. I\\'m pleased to report that Keysight had a very good quarter and we continue to focus on returning to market growth rates while meeting operating margin expectations. Turning to our performance, I will start by highlighting 3 key headlines from Keysight\\'s third quarter. First, Q3 revenues came in at the top end of our guidance range and operating margins were above expectations. Second, our overall outlook and forecast for the second half remains unchanged despite potential disruption from geopolitical, macroeconomic and company-separation risks. And third as Bill mentioned, we began operating as Keysight Technologies on August 1 and remain on track to be fully separate from Agilent in November. Now let\\'s move to the specifics. Keysight revenues of $757 million increased 8% year-over-year while orders of $722 million were up 7%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95. Keysight continues to deliver solid profit margins, generating operating profit of $149 million for the quarter, which corresponds to an operating margin of 20%. Last quarter, we highlighted the operational separation of Keysight that occurred on August 1. This was a massive step that had the potential to impact the timing of customer shipments. In fact, some customers requested early deliveries to ensure no delays during our transition, and this moved some revenue from Q4 into Q3. As we have consistently noted throughout the year, we expected our Aerospace and Defense and Communications markets to grow in the second half. These markets were the drivers of Keysight\\'s Q3 growth, but strength in these markets were offset in the Industrial and Computer markets. Aerospace and Defense revenue grew 13% this quarter with strengths in both government and prime contractor business as well as regional strength in the Americas and Asia. Communications revenue grew 16% in Q3. Wireless basestation and component manufacturing were strong. However, handset manufacturing was weak as customer buying power and increased competition accelerated price erosion in that business. Industrial Computers and Semiconductor revenue was flat year-over-year. Continued strength in semiconductor end markets was offset by the softer computer business. On a regional basis, revenues grew year-over-year in all regions, with the exception of Japan. Europe grew 16% versus a soft compare last year; Asia Pacific excluding Japan, improved 11%, with positive growth across nearly all segments; the Americas grew 8%; while Japan declined 13% due to declines in government aerospace and defense spending. Overall, Keysight continues to invest in the transformation of our product portfolio with a focus on modular, software and certain wireless solutions. Aligned with this focus, in Q3, Keysight was awarded the Global Frost & Sullivan Award for Growth Excellence Leadership in the PXI instrumentation market. We also announced a strategic partnership to collaborate in early 5G research with China Mobile, the world\\'s largest mobile network operator, and we announced participation in the Korea 5G Forum. Keysight introduced new products in the quarter, including our modular Bit Error Rate Tester, which provides a new level of scalability and flexibility for the fast-paced, high-speed digital markets. In addition, in July, we began volume shipments of our PXI vector signal analyzer. It is the world\\'s fastest and most accurate microwave vector signal analyzer that significantly reduces test times across a wide range of applications and markets. As you know, Keysight began operating as a subsidiary of Agilent on August 1 and we expect to complete the spinoff in early November. Our focus throughout this journey is to make this significant transition as seamless as possible for our customers. Our successful results to date are due to the hard work of our employees, who are implementing a separation plan that includes working closely with thousands of customers to coordinate our shipments and delivery plans in this transition period. I am very pleased with their achievement so far. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are facing several headwinds in a handful of areas, most notably Russia. Our sales to Russia have represented 3% of Keysight\\'s total revenue. The volatile political environment, as well as new export restrictions on certain products, may halt growth in one of our fastest-growing regions. Despite the geopolitical, macroeconomic and company-separation risks, we are reiterating our second half and annual guidance. We expect the FY \\'14 revenues to be in the range of $2.91 billion to $2.95 billion which represents 2% core growth at the midpoint. We have tightened the range but the midpoint is the same as we have communicated last quarter. Similarly, our expectation for full year operating margin remains unchanged at 18.9% at the midpoint. This implies Q4 revenues are expected to be in the range of $740 million to $780 million with operating margins at the midpoint of 20.5%. Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, orders grew 9% year-over-year, revenues grew 7%, and our revenue of $1.766 billion operating margin of 19.2% and EPS of $0.78 were all higher than the high end of our guidance. Please note that Q3 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported in the slide deck posted on our website. This quarter, currency added about 0.6 percentage points to our year-over-year revenue growth and acquisitions had no material impact. We bought back $50 million of stock in Q3, redeemed $500 million of debt and generated $28 million in operating cash flow. This is lower than traditional for 3 main reasons: number one, we prepaid about $60 million of supplier invoices at the end of July as we will not make any payment in the early part of August; number two, we paid $29 million for the redemption of the 2015 notes and also prepaid the current interest on that note; and number three, pre-separation expenses amounted to over $60 million. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.81 billion to $1.85 billion and EPS of $0.87 to $0.91. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.5% and EPS, 10%. Our 21% projected operating margin at midpoint will be 180 basis points higher than Q3 fiscal year \\'14 and 60 basis points higher than Q4 of last year. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we\\'re also investing in key growth initiatives. We expect to generate about -- over $300 million of operating cash flow in Q4 and incur about $60 million of pre-separation costs. Now to the fiscal year 2014. The fiscal year \\'14 guidance at midpoint remains the same as previously communicated, but we are narrowing the range. We expect fiscal year \\'14 revenues to range from $6.99 billion to $7.03 billion and fiscal year \\'14 EPS to range from $3.04 to $3.08. Great. I just want to clarify, it\\'s unclear what your expectation for Russia is -- unclear to me what your expectation for Russia is in the Keysight guidance. Are you reiterating that you can deliver guidance even if Russia -- business in Russia halts? Or are you retreating the guidance while cautioning us that Russia could drive downside? We can deliver -- our plan is to deliver the guidance with the Russia halt. This quarter, we saw very good revenue growth in Russia and we saw negative order growth in Russia. But we have taken that into consideration in our guidance. Got it. And my follow-up question. In the Agilent business, you have a competitor which is exiting the gas chromatography market. Is there any way you can quantify what this means to your opportunity in that market, either from a revenue or a margin perspective? Agilent Technologies is a leader in gas chromatography, and we will do everything we can to support our existing customers and future customers as we go forward. Just a quick question. When you look at China in total, and maybe, Ron, I\\'m thinking more on the Key [ph] side of the business. Could you just kind of speak to the tone in China and in Japan as well, just Asia in general, and how that looks over the next 3 to 6 months? Sure. First, I\\'ll start with China. We\\'ve seen hot basestation manufacturing orders as -- and we\\'ve also seen strong orders for components. On the handset side and handset manufacturing, there has been considerable price pressure and that market has undergone some real price erosion. But overall in China, our business looks pretty solid. We have seen some increases on export restrictions for China, as well as Russia, and that has affected our business a little bit. With regard to Japan, the government has not been funding any new programs that we\\'re aware of for satellites or defense work, and that has led to a continued soft environment. And just one thought is this -- as you know, Apple -- I know we don\\'t talk customers, but the last time there were some fairly significant share shift. It was attributed to Apple basically. And as they ramp up on the iPhone 6, can you -- is the test content into that automation and production run, which they want to start in September, is the test content considerably less than it was as they ramped up on the previous generation? Or has pricing eroded to a point where it does not have as significant of an impact on the industry in general? Okay. And then just -- well, let me just ask, the PXI VSA that you just started shipping, that is a bench top instrument. No, it\\'s a PXI modular instrument that could be married with other instruments in a modular form factor. It could be used on the bench or it could be used in production. I guess, Ron, your 4Q op margin guidance for Keysight of 20.5% is above the high end of your market growth model that you laid out at the Analyst Day, and I\\'m wondering if you could discuss what dynamics are driving this upside. And I assume mix is helping and then can you talk about the sustainability of this elevated margin? Sure. Well overall, first of all, we had predicted 8% growth in the second half. We delivered 8% in Q3 and if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it\\'s 8% in Q4. We did have very high incrementals above the middle of our guidance during this last quarter, but we do need to still invest in this multiyear transformation to get our product line growing at market and then eventually above market. But the guidance that we just gave right now factors everything in place. Don\\'t forget Q4 is seasonally a strong quarter which basically when you have a significant amount of fixed costs drives higher margins. Great, and then just shifting gears to basestation strength that you talked about in your prepared remarks. Can you talk about that on a geographic basis, and when we look at LTE and TD LTE markets in China, I\\'m curious how this market is faring relative to expectations and the kind of visibility or duration that you\\'re expecting from these deployments. Sure. Well, first of all, the basestation build that is obviously 4G and TD LTE for China, et cetera, and FTE [ph] for the rest of the world. But we see players in Europe and in Asia that are doing this. So when you look at some of the major players that are centered out of Europe, we see strength and then we also see strength in China in Asia in the basestation market. Well, the only other thing I could add on is the fact that especially the whole -- the 3 operators in China are now starting to deploy 4G. So that\\'s the trend that is going to be here for probably a few years, but with ups and downs at the capacity we\\'ll have to build. Bill, I wanted to start with the LDA side. It looks like the order growth in the core business there was really solid, and wanted to kind of get a little bit more color from you on the product specifics there. It really seems like you guys are taking at least a little bit of market share from your competitors just given their growth rates versus yours. It\\'ll be helpful to see a little bit of color on where you think you\\'re doing the best. Yes, I\\'ll give an overview comment and then turn it over to Mike and Fred to comment in their respective businesses. But my first warning is, I\\'ve always had, is you really have to look at the overall performance of the marketplace as a rolling 4 quarters, and again, we\\'re very happy with the performance in Q3. I\\'m particularly pleased with the rebound from Fred\\'s business from last quarter. I mean, if there is anything in the last quarter that we had is that the growth in revenue in the Life Science side was below expectations. And so that\\'s really the story from my mind is that we\\'ve got great order momentum across all of Fred\\'s product lines going forward, and I\\'ll have him comment on that. And of course, Mike\\'s business just continues to roll along. I mean, we are the leader in the applied side of the market. We have a lot of competition because people see that but his team is just doing an outstanding job of holding and if not growing position. But I\\'ll turn it over to Fred, and I\\'m going to flip the order, put -- go to Fred, because it really is the biggest change sequentially, and then turn it over to Mike. Thanks, Bill. I think we are very pleased with the results we\\'re seeing from all the platforms, I mean, almost across the board, starting on the top, I mean, the LC/MS growth rebounded quite significantly over the last 4 to 5 months after a pretty difficult fiscal year \\'13. And so we are confident that the new products are really pushing our business forward, starting with the new triple quad which we have introduced at ASMS. And also the single quad which we introduced is keeping up very well against the competition, by the way, really nice growth there. Secondly, we are seeing informatics as a key element. And as we have talked several times about it, increased investments there, informatics is really growing along with that and is pulling instrumentation with it. And third piece is in the classic instrumentation piece is the LCs, which are growing nicely as well from a revenue perspective. And turning to the pieces actually Mike owns but assigned to the Life Science business. Consumables and services were strong as well. So turning over to the genomics and diagnostics space, we saw really significant growth in the genomics space, predominantly driven by the target enrichment of the assembly preparation [ph] for next-generation sequencing. We saw solid growth in the space of pathology, mainly driven by the IQFISH with a few things we have introduced there, which are real significant advantage from a customer\\'s perspective. And we also saw the companion diagnostic rolling at the rate we were expecting. And finally, the companion diagnostic. Also the contract with Merck, they have signed, but we are seeing an increasing demand on companion diagnostic, which is in line with what we are seeing in the market in general. That\\'s helpful. And just maybe one other if I may. On China, you guys mentioned some of the changes with the SFDA. And now that, that\\'s behind us, can you maybe give us a sense of what\\'s baked into your outlook for China both in LDA, as well as EMG for the balance of the year? I\\'m going to turn it back to Mike, if you don\\'t mind, to answer the first question, because again, he\\'s got a great story on the applied side from a market perspective. And then our China business for LDA was flat. Again, Asia was up 4%, China down -- or Japan down a little bit, China, flat. And so we obviously had a very strong non-China Asia performance. I\\'m going to have Mike talk a little about his products and then comment on China because a lot of his is in China. But our China business was flat for LDA in the context of overall strong Asia that was up 4%. Obviously, China dominates that performance. And then after Mike answers, I\\'ll have it turn it over to Ron to talk about China specifically for Keysight. Thanks, Isaac, for the earlier question. So first of all building on Fred\\'s commentary about the drivers for a quarter which we\\'re very pleased with in terms of both the revenue and the incoming order rate, we saw this strong services and consumables performance in this CAG segment space for Q3. But we\\'re also seeing the growth being driven by the new product introductions we have been making over the last several quarters and the past year or so, from our introductions in the mass spectrometry area, on GC/MS and ICP-MS, and as you saw in the earnings call, we highlighted that we got one other what I believe to be an award-winning product in the spectroscopy area. So we saw strong growth in the mass spectrometry business both gas space and inorganic side, as well as our base of spectroscopy business. So the innovative products we\\'re bringing to market are actually driving growth, and this was in an environment where we had a challenged market situation in China. So I think it\\'s fairly well publicized. The food ministries, reorganizations are underway. I think it\\'s taking longer for those to settle out and for them to get organized and really get the procurement side going in terms of the new purchases. So we were delighted with the results of these type of growth rates and in a market, as Bill described, it was relatively flat in China. Ron? As far as China, our revenue growth was a little bit over 20% for the quarter, but our order growth was 5%. Mike, just back on that same question. Could you give us a sense to how orders performed in China in the period if there was any delta between the revenue experience and the order experience? Yes, thanks, Brandon, for the question. So slightly better view, about 2% order growth in Q3. And I will again reemphasize, I think the long-term growth prospects in China remain strong. And we see some of these challenges we\\'re seeing right now in the food market as just really, kind of a temporal kind of thing as they get their agencies organized, but a slightly better view on the order growth rate, but I\\'ll also say that we finished the quarter very strong in China. And then one more for Bill or Didier. Is there an opportunity for share repurchase activity to accelerate for LDA, post-spin here going forward? Our stated strategy to date as we had talked about is to, first of all, ensure that we keep our bondholders whole and reduce the debt to ensure that we can maintain our investment grade. We\\'re also committed to making a dividend payment of $130 million, which we believe will be roughly the same percentage dividend as what it was before under Agilent. Stating that, the new Agilent is very, very profitable and has very high cash flow. Our priority continues to be to look on ways to invest in the business. But I\\'ve been very clear that we have to digest a lot with the separation, the acquisitions that we have made, and we will continue to work with the Board of Directors to figure out the best way to return cash back to our shareholders. Maybe, Ron, starting on the sort of basestation and more so focused on the U.S. business. It seemed like a number of peers called out weakness at a number of the large carriers here. Could you just maybe talk about sort of what you\\'ve seen from the demand base from those folks and maybe how your business differs from some of the others where they\\'ve seen weakness, like in the business you sold to JDS. Sure. Obviously, we have a major difference in what we do in communications where some of the competitors obviously look at network monitoring and features that are basically, let\\'s say, software testing of higher levels. We\\'re testing R&D and manufacturing processes. So that is a significant difference. But I\\'ll let Guy add a little bit of color commentary. Yes, Ross, I would add that we have a very strong position in R&D and manufacturing with all the infrastructure OEMs, basestation builders. And as this market has been strong in Q3, you\\'ll see the results in our wireless numbers. Great. And maybe just, Didier, quickly on the cash flow. Could you just -- I know some of the moving parts for the quarter, but could you just remind us some of the key headwinds of why this is sort of a sub-par a year on cash flow versus what we would be used to given the sort of top line and profit results. Yes. I mean, on the year-over-year basis, most of the reduction in the cash flow from 2013 to 2014 will come from the separation cost, about $180 million, and debt redemption cost, these pluses and minuses. Also we are ending the year -- we are planning to end the year very, very strong. And even though we have best-in-class DSO of about 47, 48 days, that basically -- last year, we had a positive impact on receivables. This year we just need to -- we are building receivables, we are planning to build receivables at the end of the year to support basically, the much higher revenue growth expectation. Then again, we have best-in-class DSO so there\\'s no deterioration of DSO just applied to a higher revenue in Q4. So those are some of the main things. Just a question on the improvement in the academic and government spending. Was that a late quarter phenomenon or did you see pretty steady improvement during the quarter, just trying to get a feel for the pacing there a bit. Yes, what we are seeing is, in general, a rebound in the different geographies. I think the business is coming back honestly on easy compare relative to last year. I mean, I just can give you a few numbers. Worldwide academic research spending is pretty much flat in Europe, according to our information. China is spending about 12% growth in government funding. However, all [ph] to the things Mike was highlighting, this picture is distorted, so that probably some of the money is spent towards the later part of the year and the U.S. is growing in about 2%. So overall I think it is a situation where we can say that it\\'s a relief in this market overall and we are seeing that in our order pattern as well. Okay. Great. And then just curious what you\\'re seeing in large pharma. You guys had called out spec and midsized companies as being strong. But I think last quarter, it sounded like order patterns had been disrupted a bit. So I guess, as the big deal speculation dies down a bit are you seeing things loosen somewhat or not really? That\\'s a good question. We still see big pharma still not loosening their clutches completely. I mean, we are done seeing the big deals we have seen in the past. I think the growth, as Bill has outlined, is coming off of mid to small companies. I mean, the reason for that is they are still in the situation of potential consolidation going on. But there\\'s also the patent cliff for small molecules. Even that is almost over and we are seeing a new trend in Europe, for example, that companies, traditional companies, are starting generic businesses after a lot of that business has been moved to India. And this helps, of course, the pharma market in general. But your specific question about big pharma, I would say this is not yet completely there. Just I guess a quick cleanup on the China dynamic. Would you be willing to quantify what percentage of total sales is exposed to this government-related, as well as the, I guess, the China FDA reorganization challenges in China. I\\'ll give you an opinion. The problem is, as you know, in China, is what do you define as government and what do you define as private? Because quite technically, all of the big chem companies, even though they\\'re held as a company, are effectively owned by the government. So I think that from our perspective and where Agilent is, essentially all of the issues are related to impact of government decisions. And I\\'m again just defining anything the government effectively controls, the investment strategy is effectively government-owned. And again if you look at -- I mean, the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the chemical industry, it\\'s all highly government-impacted. And so they really do make those fundamental decisions at the end of the day. And so if you take our definition, then it is essentially 100% driven by government decision. Okay. And then I just want to I guess follow up on that by asking, I guess on one hand, it doesn\\'t sound like you\\'re expecting that to come back in Q4. On the other hand, at the end of last quarter, you talked about strong order momentum in China. You said that again I think this quarter. I believe you typically don\\'t count something as an order unless you expect it to be fulfilled within about 6 months. So I\\'m just trying to reconcile these seemingly contradictory dynamics. And if my understanding is correct, are you trying to basically say that you do expect China to come back, but it may not be this quarter, it may be, say, Q1 of next year based on what you\\'re seeing from an order standpoint? Yes, I think that all of us are in the conventional wisdom that -- or a conventional view of thought that organizational changes are relatively straightforward. And that China continues to be the most -- the country with the greatest growth opportunities that we have. Every quarter, you\\'re a little bit disappointed. I think as Mike said, exactly right, I mean, we\\'re confident in the future, you just never know how the funding breaks. And you see that in the defense business, in Ron\\'s business. So I think we\\'re in a position of -- the guidance that we have is our best forecast of what\\'s going to happen in China, so we\\'re not expecting obviously any miracles, and we\\'ll just have to play it out. The good news is, is that in Asia overall, our business is pretty good. In other parts of Asia, we\\'ve been quite successful. And we\\'ll keep our fingers crossed and hope that Q4, the bottleneck breaks and we get stronger momentum going into \\'15. Okay and one last one. You\\'ve been tracking a bit ahead of plan thus far this year. If we think about that in the context of what you talked about in terms of dis-synergies on the new Agilent side going back to your March Analyst Day, has the fact that you\\'ve done a little bit better than expected provided you any opportunity to maybe pull some of that required investment forward and maybe benefit you from a dis-synergy standpoint next year? It\\'s actually working the opposite direction. Ron and the team and our whole core of a [ph] team is doing so well for them to become independent that we have the risk of increasing the dis-synergies. As we said in -- and again, by dis-synergies, that\\'s meaning there\\'s more residual left over in Agilent to be able to manage through. However, and you see it based on our debt -- buying down our debt, we are still quite confident that first order dis-synergies in the new Agilent going forward will be offset by lower interest payments. Can I just spend a minute on gross margin? I\\'m wondering if kind of by each business, by LDG, by Chemical and by EMG. I\\'m just kind of looking at absolute revenues. I know for you guys, given the mix of business and the instrumentation, never occurred [ph] whether to look year-over-year or sequentially, but if I just look at absolute revenues in LDG and then EMG in particular, you\\'re still not back to the kind of gross margins that you were at previously, and chemical doing a little bit better. So can you maybe just talk about gross margin trends by business and kind of where you\\'re at in your journey there? I\\'ll have Ron start on Keysight, again obviously, a lot of mix impact depending on what type of deals he takes. And then we\\'ll talk about the LDA going forward. Yes, so I would echo exactly what Bill just said. So as we move from quarter-to-quarter, the mix of our products, the mix of our sales has a pretty significant impact on our gross margins. And the other point that\\'s certainly relevant, as Ron mentioned in the script, is the price erosion that we see in certain markets, most notably in the wireless manufacturing space over the past several years, if you\\'re looking at multiple-year trends, has impacted gross margins. And I\\'ll just make some high-level comments, again, Jon, if you have additional details, the guys can give an answer. But LDG is by far the most competitive market that we have. I mean, our base comes from the applied. I think we continue to make great progress in Life Science and Diagnostics. The overall gross margin is solid. I would say very, very competitive in the market. But it is the most competitive market that we have moving forward. We have to win. I\\'m absolutely convinced this will continue to be the long-term growth engine of the company. But this is where the investment is, this is where by far, the most competition is. Fortunately on Mike\\'s team, on the Applied side, continues to do a superlative job. And you can really see the investment that we have made in spectroscopy and again, I alluded to it, and I\\'ll put the plug in, we have systematically redesigned every Varian product line that we received since 2010. And so the NMR, as we said in the past, which is counted in Fred\\'s gross margin, is behind that. We\\'ve introduced one product but we really have to turn the product line one more time. But spectroscopy, we\\'re basically done, not only did we spend the money to do it right, secondly, the market sees it. We\\'re winning the awards that indicate how successful we have with the Varian engineers working together with the Agilent engineers to really develop a great product. And so I think in summary, I think the differential change has been the progress we made on the spectroscopy side. I guess, just to follow up quickly on that, Bill. I guess, thinking about LDA overall as you go forward, I guess my question was around, you highlighted that there are a lot of opportunities on the gross margin side there given, in particular some of the other product lines that you just mentioned from Varian. Are we -- I guess, kind of has anything changed in terms of what you think the potential of that could be over the next 2 to 3 years, given what you\\'re seeing rolling now? Or is it going to take a little bit longer or is everything on track? I\\'m just trying to understand I guess the timing of these improvements. Okay. And then if I can quickly, Ron, can you, on the Electronic Measurement side, I know -- the way a lot of people have reported and it\\'s always hard as you already alluded to in earlier comments to compare one company to another depending on their mix and other pieces of business. But you guys obviously have a lot easier comps than others did in terms of what they were doing a year ago, you had some customer losses and things like that. I guess how would you just overall describe the environment and the overall test measurement market kind of putting aside all of these individual company issues? Maybe just give us a sense of how you describe the overall market. Sure. If you look at the -- sure, I\\'ll just break down by some of the segments. The semiconductor market looks good as they moved to some 20-nanometer pitches. The industrial market looks relatively flattish. The computer market itself is not growing very rapidly from all of the tablet conversion from PCs. In communications, we are seeing a buildout of the infrastructure in basestations, and that certainly helps as people move over to 4G. But there is massive handset manufacturing test pressure on pricing. As more people have entered into the market and people have been very, very aggressive on pricing, that really affects the attractiveness of that market. In aerospace/defense as we saw a nice rebound, a 13% growth in this past quarter, that\\'s from a free up from some of the spending that we saw last quarter and we expect to continue into Q4 with the end of the U.S. fiscal year. So overall on the markets, what we had talked about last year, we see communications a little bit better than the 2% growth that we outlined last quarter for fiscal year \\'14. We see also the aerospace/defense doing a little bit better than what we had outlined, but we do not see the industrial and computer segment tracking to the 5% that we outlined. So 2 segments are a little bit up, 1 segment is down and net-net, that gives us to our 8% growth for the half. We believe the market growth for next year will be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range, and we\\'re trying to get back to that growth rate. This is actually Bryan Kipp, on behalf of Paul. First one, I think I just want to piggyback on an earlier question on the specialty pharma growth. What\\'s really underlying that? I mean, there\\'s been commentary that there\\'s been an uptick in India. And I wonder if that\\'s kind of supporting some of the growth there. And is it additional products that you guys are seeing, is it focused in one area and one vertical for your business, or is it multiple? Just color on that will be helpful. I think we are seeing, as I said before, we are seeing pharma, in general, the big pharma probably more restrained than the smaller ones. I think the product portfolio we have at the moment is really ideally suited at this point in time to enter this market. I think with the new introductions in the LC space and in the LC/MS space, I think we have made inroads in that and the driving force is increasing productivity. These are the reasons why customers even under tight pressure are deciding to move on to purchase instruments in these times. And I think particular in India, I think we\\'re seeing an uptick. The growth in the market overall, we are seeing there the total market is probably at double-digit market growth at this point in time. And so yes, we are hoping that and are optimistic that the big pharma spending starts continuing towards the end of this year. Okay, and you think that the tail for the specialty pharma investment, especially I mean, the 11% you alluded to in India, do you think that has some longevity to it? And I guess in addition, I think there\\'s a question on pacing for academic and government especially in Europe, how do you guys see that pace throughout the quarter? Do you see -- I know you said rebound overall, but did it get stronger month over month? The rates, yes, I believe even so that the spending as I said before is relatively flat, I think that the batches [ph] is released and we are seeing continuous investments being made by the institutions and just one fact, in Europe, the European Parliament has just released a fund of about $5 billion for the next 10 years for bio-related research. Okay. And then, Mike, if I can do a quick follow-up. I know U.S. refining capacity has been pretty strong to start the year. U.S. is I think you guys have alluded to, has been not robust but it\\'s has been steady grower for you all to start the year, hasn\\'t been too crazy. Color around that and then I didn\\'t see anything on the Middle East. Is that starting to fall off a little bit or be more flat, are you still seeing support there? Yes, great question. Thanks for the opportunity to provide additional color. So let\\'s maybe start with the Middle East. That part of the world continues to be a very strong growth region for us. They\\'re investing in capacity in-country, moving -- trying to move higher end of the value chain of refined products. So that area is growing nicely for us. And in the U.S., I think the commentary is still relatively the same as last quarter, which was overall, the industry has probably never been healthier in the U.S. fueled by the low-cost of the fuel stocks from shale gas. And we\\'re seeing plans by our major customers to add infrastructure, build capacity. That hasn\\'t yet come online and translated into new business. So the business is still a steady grower, but I think as the profit pools continue to grow and invest, I think we could look toward a healthier investment environment for us down the road. Actually, I sort of have a mechanics question, and just sort of looking more in terms of how you\\'re going to report fourth quarter. And I just want to make sure I understand. So you basically said you\\'re just going to report the Agilent LDA business as it sort of stands and no commentary on Keysight, is that correct? No. We will report Agilent results with Keysight in Q4. We will discuss in the earnings call the new Agilent going forward. And Ron and team will have a separate investor call afterwards to talk about the results of Q4 and their guidance for FY \\'15. So for Agilent, no change except that obviously, in terms of our financial report, but obviously the focus of the presentation will solely be on LDA. And then on -- at the same time about Keysight will present their financial results and provide their report on their business separately from Agilent. Okay great. Just want to clarify that. So you\\'d mentioned some strengths in the single quad market. Is that the new 6120 that you\\'re talking about? Yes, okay. And then I mean, that goes against -- I mean, you\\'re targeting that for the chromatography market, and that\\'s going against one of your competitor\\'s product, the QDa, on that. Is that -- is that wins against gap products in that market, or just a little bit dynamics on what you\\'re seeing since that\\'s obviously a new sort of instrument for that sort of chromatographic researcher standpoint. I think that\\'s actually a good question. I think we are winning against our competitors at the moment, particularly the product is refilling [ph] just by the fact that our product is more universally usable, and it\\'s more flexible in the application space. It can be deployed and I think that\\'s the major difference between the product, which actually is also from a price perspective, very competitive, and I think those 2 factors are driving the growth in the total single quad market, but also particular against this instrument. I would say it\\'s driving also new instruments in the LC space, particular where these single quads are used in more routine applications, pharma clearly. This is one of the reasons why we are seeing small -- in the small pharma space, small company pharma space, we are seeing this growth rates. Great. And then just one quick question. On the PDL1 ligand, the companion diagnostic. How do we -- I\\'ve had a number of questions from investors about how to sort of think about the size of that market and that opportunity for companion diagnostic. Can you give us some color around that, and I guess relate that to maybe what your experience was sort of with the [indiscernible] I mean, it is -- yes, sorry, good question as well. I think it is very difficult to say how big the market is because there is no real commercial product at the market at the moment. At the moment, Agilent is providing services, development services, for products which are not yet on the market. And I think this is the value proposition at this point in time. However, once those products -- I mean, I\\'m talking about the pharmaceutical products, make it through the value chain, I think, then we can talk about markets that is why it is very difficult at the moment to assess that. And again, I think as Fred said, just look at it as a service opportunity, that we\\'re providing services, and the big payoff is, if we\\'re lucky enough to -- and skillful enough to partner with somebody that they will deliver a differential product in the marketplace, we will get the additional revenue from supporting those reagents and instruments. I mean just one anecdotal information, if you look to the development of new drugs at the moment, I think a big part of the drugs, and if you correlate that with the success of the drugs in the clinics, it\\'s correlating with companion diagnostic, which is codeveloped basically with the drug itself. And I think this is the opportunity afterwards beyond the service business, as Bill just said. Ron, I\\'m wondering, you mentioned revenue pull forward for Keysight ahead of the official go live date on August 1. Is there any way you can quantify that? Okay. And then is there any chance you guys might be wanting to comment at all on \\'15? I mean if we look -- the Street\\'s, I think, 5% core for LDG and 5.5% for EMG. Ron, you just talked about the market growing 2.5% to 3%. So as we think out there for next year any preliminary thoughts? We\\'re going to have to wait to next earnings call before we give the \\'15 guidance moving forward. And also I think it\\'s important not speaking for Ron, but working with his new board to make sure that everyone\\'s aligned for their guidance in \\'15, and likewise with our board. Okay. And then lastly, you explicitly in the pathology talked about Europe being strong. Can you maybe just talk to the dynamics there and then what was going on in the U.S. and if there was a reason that wasn\\'t called out today? Yes, well, Fred\\'s clearly the expert in Europe, so I\\'ll have Fred talk about again, the continued strength that we have in Europe both from a product standpoint and a customer standpoint. I think you see a tremendous tick-up in our sales in Europe and this is mainly driven through the product categories I have been talking about. And it\\'s across the market, so including Mike\\'s markets as well. And we see the academia [ph] government for the reasons I have given before also picking up. And I believe it is the pharmaceutical industry which drives growth, even though we don\\'t see the full potential yet, so I\\'m optimistic that this trend really continues. And Fred, this is Mike. If I can maybe just build on your comments and maybe add a geographic perspective. Within Europe, we often think of Europe as being Western Europe. But if you look to what we call the IDO, the Eastern Europe part of our business, it actually is growing quite strongly as well, so there\\'s both a economic, geographic dimension sort of under the covers if you will in our European numbers. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Thank you, Karen. And on behalf of the management team and myself, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please call us at IR and we\\'ll be happy to get back to you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Agilent Technologies’ Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Please note, today’s conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, please go ahead. Thank you, Karen, and welcome everyone to Agilent’s second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2014. With me are Bill Sullivan, Agilent’s President and CEO; Ron Nersesian, CEO of Keysight Technologies; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier’s comments will be the presidents of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics groups, Mike McMullen and Fred Strohmeier. Also joining from Keysight will be Neil Dougherty, CFO; and Guy Séné, Senior Vice President of R&D and Sales. You can find the press release and information to supplement today’s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an investor presentation along with revenue breakouts, business segment results, and historical financials for Agilent’s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today’s comments by Bill, Ron, and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company and the separation of the electronic measurement business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Lastly, as we expect the third quarter to be the final quarter before Agilent’s Electronic Measurement Group begins operating as Keysight Technologies, comments today will also refer to the Electronic Measurement Group as Keysight. Thanks, Alicia, and hello everyone. Today, Agilent reported second quarter revenues and EPS in line with commitments, with solid growth in orders. Revenues of $1.73 billion were unchanged from a year ago. Q2 orders of $1.81 billion were up 7% over last year. Adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share were at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 18.2%. Keysight revenues came in at the high end of expectations. LDA revenues were slightly below the low end of our guidance. Both businesses built backlog as orders accelerated late in the quarter. Book-to-bill for Agilent was 1.05 positioning us well as we move into Q3. Our work to split the company continues to proceed smoothly. By the beginning of August, we expect Keysight to operate independently as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. We continue to expect the separation to be completed by early November. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science, diagnostics and applied markets that will become the new Agilent. Following my remarks, Ron will discuss electronic measurement markets that will become Keysight. Finally, Didier will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent’s overall financial results, as well as our guidance for fiscal Q3 and fiscal year. Turning to LDA, second quarter revenue of $988 million grew 2% year-over-year on both a reported and core basis. We saw good growth across pharma, clinical and diagnostics, energy and food businesses tempered by the results in academic and government and environmental markets. Orders accelerated at the end of the quarter as we built backlog. Book-to-bill for LDA was 1.04, with orders of $1.03 billion, up 4% or 5% on a core basis over last year. Operating margins, adjusted to revenue, were in line with guidance. Turning now to performance by end market, in life sciences, we saw strength in pharma/biotech, up 4% led by demand from midsized and specialized pharma customers. Diagnostics and clinical revenues were up 7% driven by record companion diagnostics growth and strong demand for CGH arrays and target enrichment solutions. Academic and government remained soft, down 6% year-over-year as government spending delays in the U.S. and China pressured results. In the applied markets Food Testing was up 10% with globalization of the food supply and brand protection continuing to drive strong demand. Energy grew 2% led by the U.S. and refinery projects in the Middle East conversely environmental and forensics were down 5% impacted by government funding. On a regional basis LDA performance was mixed. Double digit growth in Europe was broad based across markets. In the Americas revenues were down 2% on delays in U.S. government spending and softness in Latin America. Asia-Pacific was down 3% affected by slower government funding and lengthened approval cycles in China. We saw improvement in China towards the end of the quarter. Within LDA our life science and diagnostic group had Q2 revenue of $577 million, up 1% from a year ago as recurring revenues offset softness in instrumentation. Orders of $598 million were up 3% year-over-year, operating margin was 13% for the quarter. In early May LDG recently announced the latest version of chromatography data systems CDS software called OpenLAB CDS. New features include flexible data capture, improved automation and faster data analysis. We also introduced a range of new LC products during this quarter’s HPLC 2014 in New Orleans. Announcements include a new next generation UHP-LC multi-sampler which sets a new benchmark in throughput, speed and carryover. We also introduced an updated two dimensional LC system for higher resolution applications. And we are launching a series of new LC/MS and GC/MS products at ASMS next month. These solutions are differentiated by higher performance and lower cost of ownership making them ideally suited for the applications in our core markets. The chemical analysis group had Q2 revenues of $411 million, up 3% and led by strong demand for GC/MS and ICP-MS and services. Orders of $432 million grew 6% year-over-year. Operating margin was 22% for the quarter. The ultra high performance of 7200 GC/Q-TOF continues to exceed expectations with Europe leading all regions for the adaption of high-resolution, accurate GC/MS. CAG recently signed a major contract with a leading environmental company in Beijing. Agilent will supply GC/MS technology for online air monitoring systems, related to ozone and other air pollution – airborne pollutants. Looking forward, LDA’s outlook remains positive, supported by our backlog build, a robust pipeline of new products and expectations for increased flows in government spending. We remain committed to creating shareholder value by increasing our organic growth rate, delivering complete workflow solutions for our customers and growing earnings faster than revenues. Moving forward, our priorities are to continue our late-Q2 order momentum into Q3, launch a series of new products and continue to drive our manufacturing cost reduction programs. LDA revenues for the fiscal third quarter of FY ‘14 are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.02 billion, or nearly 5% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 18.5%. For the full year, we now expect LDA revenues to range from $4.02 billion to $4.12 billion with operating margins at the midpoint of 19.3%. Didier will provide additional details in his commentary. Thank you for being on the call. Now I will turn it over to Ron to talk about Keysight and the Electronic Measurement business. Thank you, Bill and hello everyone. I have three key headlines for you regarding Keysight’s performance in Q2. First, Keysight came in at the top end of its revenue and operating profit margin guidance. Second, Keysight orders returned to growth in Q2. And third, Keysight is on track with its plans to separate from Agilent. Now, moving to the specifics, revenue of $743 million declined 2% or 1% on a core basis, while orders of $782 million were up 11% year-over-year. This resulted in a book to bill ratio of 1.05. Keysight continued to not only effectively manage gross margins and spending, but also had a favorable mix profile this quarter. Keysight generated operating profit of $148 million and an operating margin of 20% for the quarter. Looking to our end market performance, aerospace and defense revenues declined 6% year-over-year. With U.S. budget approvals in place, direct government demand has improved, while prime contractor business in the U.S. remains soft. International aerospace and defense demand was mixed but steady. Industrial computers and semiconductors revenues increased 3% year-over-year, investments in next generation semiconductor process technologies continued in the second quarter, while computer markets remains soft. Communications revenue declined 6% year-over-year. We continue to see strength in 4G base station infrastructure demand, while handset device manufacturing remains moderate. On a regional basis, we saw very good growth in Asia excluding Japan, which grew over 20% with strength across most market segments. The Americas region was down double-digits year-over-year versus the strong compare. Decline – Japan declined 12% or down 4% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency. Europe was essentially flat year-over-year. As I discussed during our Analyst Day in March, Keysight is transforming its product portfolio with the goal of returning to market growth rates. This quarter, we began shipping both UXM wireless test set for R&D and the EXM wireless test set for manufacturing. The EXM wireless test set won 2013 Product of the Year award from the Electronic Products China. In April, Keysight expanded its performance network analyzer series with a low price model targeted at low cost RF components used in handsets and consumer products. Keysight also introduced two high performance portable oscilloscopes deploying next generation technology. One set a new standard for signal integrity and the other set a new standard for price performance. We expect Keysight to begin operating as a subsidiary of Agilent on August 1, and to complete the spin-off in early November. As part of our journey, we are announcing today that we expect Keysight common stock to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KEYS. In addition, at the end of this quarter we will implement an operational cut over of our IT systems. This transition requires tight coordination of our shipment and delivery plans. We are working with customers on the cut over which could cause some revenue to ship between the quarters. As Bill had said, it takes a lot of work to create two great companies from one. Along with all of the excellent internal work, we continue to focus on our customers and all of their measurement solutions needs. Turning to the outlook for Q3, we expect Keysight to return to revenue growth with revenues in the range of $720 million to $760 million. We project core growth at the midpoint to be 5% and operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.4%. For the full year, we expect revenues in the range of $2.86 billion to $3 billion, which represents 2% core growth at the midpoint. Operating margins for the full year are expected to be 18.9% at the midpoint. Thank you, Ron, and hello everyone. To recap the quarter, our revenue of $1,731 million, operating margin of 18.2% and earnings per share of $0.72 were all at the midpoint of our guidance. Orders exceeded our expectations, but the quarter end orders queue was also higher than usual. By business, most of the operating profit variance versus the midpoint of our guidance was due to volume and mix. Please note that Q2 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported on the slide deck posted on our website. This quarter, currency subtracted about 0.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth, and acquisitions had no material impact. Finally, we bought back $50 million of stock in Q2 and generated $272 million in free cash flow, slightly higher than last year. I will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion and EPS of $0.72 to $0.74. At midpoint, revenue will grow 5% on a core basis. Our 18.5% projected operating margin at midpoint will be 30 basis points higher than Q2 fiscal year ‘14 and 20 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. Now, remember that we initiated a drastic cut in discretionary expenses early February of last year that resulted in significant expense reductions in the ensuing months. So, we face a tough compare. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we are also investing in key growth initiatives. Now, to the guidance for fiscal year 2014, we are confirming the guidance we provided last quarter for both revenue and EPS. And as a reminder, we expect fiscal year ‘14 revenues to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and fiscal year ‘14 EPS to range from $2.96 to $3.16. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe for both Bill and Ron, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the kind of the pacing in the quarter, I think you made some comments that orders picked up towards the end of the quarter, in particular in China that some of the delay you start to see materialize. I don’t know if that was more just an LDA comment or if that was also a Keysight comment? And then can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the other emerging markets and whether you are seeing any impact in countries like Russia or Eastern Europe given the environment over there? Yes, I will just make a couple of comments, Jon, regarding LDA and then turn it over to Ron, because the real start of the quarter in my mind is the fantastic order performance of Keysight will maintain their operational excellence. As Didier alluded to, the orders in LDA came in late in the quarter, which is atypical given that half the business is in consumables and parts that it tends to have a more uniform order pattern than you typically see in Keysight. So, we had a back end bias, that obviously affect our revenue. Our revenue was below our own internal expectations and external guidance moving forward. The good news is the orders were there. And as we guided going forward, I think we are in solid position moving into Q3, but we really did have a surge of orders at the end that was out of typical sequence moving forward. And I will rather turn it over to Ron and talk about Keysight. And Jon, if you have any other questions, I can have Mike and Fred talk specifically in terms of what they saw in their respective businesses. Ron? The story was a little bit different in Keysight where we saw orders that were a little bit more balanced throughout the quarter. Clearly with wireless manufacturing, the orders are lumpy. And the good news is that with the wireless manufacturing and semiconductor business that we had, we achieved more orders towards the first two-thirds of the quarter and that enabled us to exceed our revenue guidance. As far as the emerging markets, Russia is the biggest wildcard that we have given that everything of that is going on over there politically. We actually had a decent quarter, but we are cautiously watching what will happen as we look in Q3. We expect our performance in Q3 in Russia to be flat and all signs so far on a local level appear to be consistent with that. I will just follow up, Jon. And maybe Mike, you could make some comments with the order pattern on the applied side and then Fred on the life science and diagnostics side. Yes, sure, Bill. Jon, it’s Mike McMullen. I just had some additional commentary on the quarter, very pleased with the overall order rate for the business. And I think you can see the backlog we have built and the difference between the growth rate of our segment orders versus revenue and particularly pleased by a return to really solid growth in our core instrumentation platforms. And as you know, that’s been an area of struggle in the last several quarters, where you have been looking for this churn on in the replacement market. So, what we are seeing is warming up of the replacement market and signs of return of spending on some of the government side, particularly in the U.S. and promises in China. So, very encouraged by the overall global results, in particular how we have finished the quarter in China. Yes, let me just add also couple of comments. If you look to the different markets we saw strength in the pharmaceutical market as Bill has pointed out on the one side even so the consolidation puts some hold on it and the growth rate was predominantly coming from smaller pharma companies. I think if you look to the geographies, I think China was a little bit behind I think with a bit suffering in the U.S. I think Europe was doing quite well and specifically to the comment on Russia, even so there is impact, I think the size of the business from an LDG perspective is rather marginal, so minor impact from that perspective. Okay. And maybe just kind of two quick follow-ups on, from the LDA side, just to be clear maybe what did you grow in China in the quarter and what’s your expectation for the year? And then for Ron, on the Keysight side, I think you guided to 5% core growth in the third quarter, I think in the – at your Analyst Day, you kind of commented on high single-digit growth for Keysight in the second half of the year. So, I am just curious if that guidance still stands as well? Thanks. They give you an indication in round numbers. China’s business was down mid single-digits. The flipside orders were up mid single-digits. And on the Keysight, our guidance from last quarter still stands and we had expected 5% in Q3 and then that accelerates in Q4. Hi, good afternoon. So you essentially reiterated LDA revenue and you guided the July revenue quarter about in line with what we were expecting. So all-in-all, no real change in guidance or quarterly placing to revenue. However, your fiscal Q2 operating performance in LDA was much weaker than expected and you guided fiscal Q3 op margin for the group a bit below our expectations. So, this implies that fiscal Q4 operating margin I think gets up to somewhere between 21.5% and 22% assuming them doing the math right? And if so this implies an incremental above 30%, so year-over-year, this doesn’t seem Herculean, but it does arguably represent a pretty material level of improvement over the last two quarters of the year relative to what was a weak quarter this quarter. So, can you talk about how confident you are in this guidance and more specifically what makes you so confident that you can get to those levels subsequent to this performance? And I think as you are talking about this, I think to be fair, you guys didn’t spend a lot of time explaining why the margins in LDA came in, in these levels in the quarter. So maybe you can talk a little bit more about that? So, hi Doug, this is Didier. I was talking about the numbers and then probably my colleagues will want to talk about their confidence to achieve the second half, but in terms of Q2 what happened is yes, LDA’s operating profit was below the guidance that is very much in line with our revenue mix, which again was due to orders being skewed towards the end of the quarter. And therefore, we will recover that mix into the second half. And that explains the second half patterns. So, basically nothing fundamental, nothing special in Q2, the only – the main reason by far for the operating margins performed below the guidance is volume and mix and as we are recovering because we have a high backlog go into Q3, obviously we will see that the offset in the second half. Now within the second half, there is no doubt that Q4 I mean even the second half even though there is an expectation of a significant improvement in operating margin between Q2 and Q3 for LDA, there is further improvement expected from Q3 to Q4 in line with the revenue growth. I will just add on to Didier and it goes back, (your think) is correct Q4 is our strongest quarter of the year, very typical and at companies like ours that last quarter tends to be strong. And if you go back in 2013 LG went from Q3 to Q4 from 60% operating profit to 19% and the chemical analysis went from 21.5% to 25%. So again we are not forecasting anything that is we have not seen in the past and obviously both Mike and Fred have committed to meet this guidance. Okay. Alright, thank you for that. That’s helpful and if I could ask one more, I think it’s interesting that you noted challenges for LDA in China within the academic government end market due to the release of budgets, over the course of the recent earnings season, we have really heard this only from Waters, I mean we heard a little bit from others, but they didn’t really call it out as notably as you and Waters have. And I am pointing the companies like Thermo, Danaher, PKI and Bruker to name a few, so on the surface the common denominator here seems to be maybe instrument mix as a percentage of sales and possibly more exposure to LC, I am just curious if you would speak to what specifically you are seeing in terms of what’s slowing down in China within the academic government end market and what isn’t, I think it would just be helpful to sort of contextualize what is going on and why this seems to be specifically impacting some more than others? Thank you. Yes. One of these – I will have both Fred and Mike comment on that and again the China FDA is in major reorganization and parts of the business they regulate we have very large market shares. And but I will have Fred start on the academic research and then also Mike can chime in on some of the applied and food areas where we have very strong positions. Yes. Thank you, Bill. Let me make one statement about the growth in China overall. If you look to the second quarter and compare that to this year’s second quarter and you compare that to the second quarter last year, I think the growth in general has slowed as such, so that’s the general observation. Secondly, I think if you look to the pharmaceutical industry, there has been quality regulation imposed to the pharmaceutical industry in the GMP space, good manufacturing practices. And this why is the part of the consolidation in India, China – in the China pharmaceutical industry which means another investment is retarded quite a bit. So China academic spending as Bill already pointed out I think this has been also a temporary slow down due to some regulations, which have been put in place in terms of anticorruption, which is also something which probably will go away over time once the process has been installed. And finally, as Bill also pointed out, China FDA is at the moment restructuring the food testing labs. And until this restructuring has been completed, I think we will see a shorter investment pattern of the food labs which probably is in the order of a couple of $10 million a quarter. And I think this will – as soon as this has been removed although it will stimulate the orders again. I am just building on Fred’s comments specific to the food market, it’s a heavy platform usage of LC in the food market where Agilent as you know has a leadership position. So where the double-edged sword where we really are affected when see budgets shift to latter part of the year, I think there is a heavy concentration of liquids base used in that market segment. And again that’s why in the early part of the call I indicated I was very delighted by our performance in Q2 from the order perspective because despite the challenges that were highlighting here in terms of timing of the food orders in China. We saw a very strong growth in the environmental side as well as expanding in the petrochemical and chemical side, in the private sector side of the marketplace. So that’s why we’re looking ahead to second half 2014 you’re getting a positive view overall about the business. Just one final comment with regards to China I mean it’s slightly different in this space of genomics and diagnostic, this is where we saw a different pattern and we saw pronounced close beyond the instrumentation Mike and I were talking before. Yes. Just Bill could you just kind of address I think when you were talking about LDA in total you commented about revenue out of Europe being plus double-digits with pretty much Americas and Asia-Pac softer. Could you just be a little bit more specific, is that end-markets are – what was as strong in Europe? Well Europe is as strong as I had noted across all markets and again Fred having – living in Europe talk a little bit about it and then Mike chime in. But our Europe team just did an outstanding job across all of our products to be able to grow in the low teens growth rate in orders. Fred. Yes. I think Europe is as we see the recovery particularly in the academia and government royalty we’re seeing a stimulus of the autos. And if you look to the different industries and then Mike can comment on the chemical analysis side. We saw a significant pickup in the pharmaceutical industry, these are pretty successful particularly that was the LC/MS and I believe this will continue in the second half. And just to build on Fred’s comments what a difference a year makes. So Europe was a real area of strength for us in the quarter. As Bill mentioned our team is doing an outstanding job driving share in what is now a growing market for us and we started to see an uptake in the chemical energy space in terms of replacement side of the business, investments in the food area continue to be very strong in Europe as well as in the forensic area. Okay. And then just a quick question on Keysight, when we look at the order growth the 12% order growth year-over-year, I’m curious if – Ron can you give a picture of is that order growth strengthened significantly in either any of these three pieces in particular comps or A&D and is there some recapture of market share that you could – that you can identify? First of all, 11% order growth was driven with two main areas. As you know the wireless manufacturing business is a lumpy business and we’re very successful in that area in the base station growth as we mentioned. The second thing we talked about last quarter as well as today is in the semiconductor expansion as they move to new technologies and again that was something that also drove our business. I was pleased to see double-digit order growth in all of our major regions except Japan which is having some problems, so that is a nice point that led to our 11% growth. Ron, one of the things that we kind of picked up in the channel in the A&D business in particular on the defense side, the Department of Defense, U.S. they I believe they’ve changed the way they are purchasing and previously they had purchased test equipment and pushed that test equipment down to the vendors stating the protocol and providing the test equipment. And our understanding is that, that has switched around now the DoD is asking the vendors to purchase the equipment and I’m curious is that changed anything in the channel for instance lease verse purchase or.. No, we’ve always seen a mix between direct government purchases and purchases by the prime contractors. As I mentioned earlier the direct government purchases has picked up but the prime purchasing has not. And if you look at the financial results of the prime contractors in the U.S. that would sort of explain it. Internationally there was no significant change there that business was roughly consistent with where it was before. Great. Thank you. Could you speak to the order trends in large pharma, I know you mentioned mid-size and I think specialty pharma was strong, but I’m asking because there was an increase in M&A chatter towards the end of the quarter. And I’m wondering if it has put any freeze on ordering? Look we’re seeing in the pharmaceutical market at this point in time that the consolidation talks between the big pharmas like Pfizer and AstraZeneca is certainly putting some hold on the whole investment pattern in the pharmaceutical industry. I think as I said before the smaller pharma companies are driving the growth at this point in time and I think over time as soon as this situation has speed up I think we will see that those big companies will go to single vendor their concepts and I think our opportunity there is to be a systems provider for those big pharmaceutical companies. That’s helpful. And Didier a follow-up on Doug’s question from earlier. Can you elaborate a bit more on the negative mix component in LDG and still trying to get my arms around since it was the lowest performance in a couple of years? Yes, I mean I won’t go into the detail but when you do the math we have about you would expect 65% contribution margin versus the variable cost of sales. So if you do the math on the reduction in revenue versus the guidance that we provided and you still get 65% of the reduction in revenue will fold to the bottom line basically it was flat it’s like $4 million to $5 million and doing the analysis and again we have plenty, plenty of products and the markets and the product lines like that. Whatever it is not explained by peer volume which is about $4 million we could explain it mostly by mix factor. Thank you. And then finally a really quick one. Did you notice anything in the Life Science and Diagnostic and Chemical Analysis businesses? Did you notice anything unusual about the revenue or ordering patterns from Japan in the quarter, and I ask because there has been some discussion that a tax change for one might have shipped it around some purchasing and you guys with in April and quarters should have – could have some insight into that? I think the one – I think it was in March, I think we saw a pretty good month because this was just before the tax rate and I think this good all the way got partially compensated by the April, by the fact that there was a higher sales tax. And but in general if you look to LDG I think you have exhibited some overall growth in Japan. Hi, thanks for taking the question. EMG came in at the high end of guidance. Can you talk to maybe where you’re most surprised to the upside? And then looking ahead you did have a competitor that’s talking about in handset testing another $300 million or so coming out of that market, you maybe just talk us whether you still think flat growth to that market is the right assumption? Sure. The semiconductor market or the semiconductor test equipment market was very hot and we have very high margins in that business and accordingly that helped us and that’s why we had such outstanding incremental above the midpoint of the guidance over 80%, but that’s not something that we expect to repeat. We had been seeing a lot of price pressure in the handset wireless manufacturing segment, that is why our strategy continues to be to move more and more to R&D, but that pressure that is there on the pricing continues to accelerate. So if you take a mix of high let’s just call it a lot of semiconductor shipments and very little or less handset manufacturing shipments you get the very, very strong incrementals. As we go to next quarter we expect to have a much more normal balance as we move from Q2 to Q3. And your view on just kind of the overall handset testing market I mean do you think that, that market remains flat or or do you see it consolidating in fact? I think there is enough – there is significant price pressure as that market has become crowded and manufactures continue to look for simpler ways to test their products. It’s all about cost per test. The market is very competitive and it’s one of the lower margin areas or one of the lower margin businesses that are there. We are seeing competitors will be acting more desperate ways on the pricing side and we are doing the right thing for the shareholder and making sure we are going to return in everything that we invest in and where we put our effort. And then for LDA it sounds like environmental front (excludes) kind of the delta relative to the expectation, can you maybe just talk to it, it sounds like you are expecting a recovery in that business for the back half of the calendar year, is that driving the potential upside. And then you had previously called out some delays I think in pathology did those come through this quarter? I will jump right in and my perspective here. So the environmental and forensic business was down in Q2. The story here remains the weakness in government spending particularly in the more developed countries and economies. When I look to the second half, we are expecting to see improvement in the area as some of the government budgets are released let’s say in the U.S. So we are expecting some uptick in the second half in those areas, both at the federal and state level. But I also think the bigger driver is China as the overall global food market and the growth in the chemical energy space, our major customers are now talking about and in investing in capacity in the U.S. because of the lower feedstocks making their overall operations much more profitable. So clearly there is an element of recovery building around the environmental forensics market, but I also expect strong growth in other two larger markets. And then Bill, can you just comment on that, did you have some policy orders that came through from the prior quarter? Yes. This is – it looks like you are right I think we had a really strong quarter for diagnostics and genomics. And particular the diagnostics piece was growing mid-single digits and it’s driven by the pathology business and even more so by the companion diagnostics which we believe was outstanding as Bill mentioned at his initial comments, I think genomics we see a pronounced need in the market at the moment I think its growing about mid-digit to high-mid digit range. And it’s predominantly driven by cytogenetics and the CGH race. And secondly the target enrichment business, which is going very nicely were also relative to our competitors. Thanks for taking the question, actually, Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Ron, I just wanted to start on EMG. I know its kind have been discussed throughout some additional question here you talked about wireless manufacturing orders and semiconductor orders starting off pretty strong and then pull through in the quarter. Where it’s some of those orders stuff you expected in the second – I guess in the third quarter. I know you said that 5% expect progress anyway and then in addition to that first quarter growth obviously has to be in that high end of prior guidance the second half alluded to 8%. What’s really driving that for I know you mentioned strength in the wireless or semiconductor demand but is it new products some existing products legacy products. Just to give more clarity on that? Sure. First of all, there was nothing pulled up to when we look at the 5% nothing was pulled into Q3 that would make that Q3 looked weaker that’s probably this components with the 5%. We’ve always assumed an economic outlook that would pick-up towards the end of the year that’s where as a low level base line and top of that’s a government which has not been purchasing very much obviously during sequestration, they finally are getting their act together on getting money out to the people that make to decisions. So we expect the government business to accelerate towards the end of the fiscal year for the government in September in the U.S. On top that our seasonally high quarter is always Q4 so Q4 is our strongest quarter and if you look at what we did last year $705 million in Q4 was a relatively low compare. So if you take a look at the low compare you look at your 780 ish million dollars in orders in Q2 we typically see Q2 and Q4 be strong against a compare of $705 million you can do the math and get there pretty quickly with any type of economic strength or slow recovery and with some new products that are coming out. I mentioned the UXM and EXM where our competitive position is very strong, it’s as strong as it has been in years in those areas but will continue to build on those. Yes. I appreciate it. And then I guess just an additional follow-up on the chemical side. You cited (indiscernible) office a strong adoption in Europe, I think it since consecutive quarters of strong refinery demand in the Middle East. The order bookings were plus 7% on a core basis is to be driven by broader QC adoption and demand or what’s really driving that core order growth there? Great question. So thanks for that. So, on the mass spectrometry side there continued to be demand particularly for technologies that allow you look for unknown. This has become an increasingly desired capability both in the food but also in the forensics area and that’s why I spoke earlier to some bright spots in terms of forensics coming up. So the demand from mass spectrometry is really been driven by – continuing to driven by the food market but also there is emerging requirement to identify unknown both in the food supply as well as in designer drugs for forensics. And then you hit the nail really in the head in terms of what’s going out in terms of Middle East we’re seeing infrastructure build-out, major projects coming to fruition and Agilent is very strong in this space and we’re getting the business. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if on the LDA side just wanted to talk a little bit more into the weakness this quarter on revenue. Was there any meaningful impact from your exit last year from the high end NMR markets? I’m just trying to get a sense of whether that was a factor and just as we move to the balance of the year maybe you could put some color around that wakened your expectations just given we’ll be lapping through the exit on that business but at the same time you had a pretty healthy order dynamic this quarter? Yes. Our shortfall in revenue in the quarter as we have said is really directed to the late orders that came in they were atypical. The NMR business was non-material to that issue at all. And as you can hear from the comments for every place that we had some good news we had some offsetting bad news. And so quite frankly it was the mixed quarter and I think the message is the orders ended up being strong and we feel comfortable with the guidance that we’ve given as we move into the second half of the year. Got it. And I apologize if you guys gave the number, but just hoping for the overall growth rate in China, if you could speak to that, I know you guys gave a consolidated Asia Japan number, but maybe try to tease out China on the growth rate and looking what you’re expecting for the balance of the year there? Thank you. On the LDA side the business was down mid single digits, orders were up mid single digits moving forward. And for us to be able to grow 5% in the second half we have to continue to see the order momentum in China as we move forward I think both Mike and Fred talked about where we think that there will be opportunity as the government reorganizations and focus are completed. And that was indicative of stronger orders in China at the end of the quarter. Thanks. Good afternoon. Bill, in terms of the late 2Q order surge, was it attributable to any particular end market customer or geography or would you characterize it as more broad-based? Mike and Fred make a comment from an aggregate it was broad-base, but Mike and Fred probably a little more insight, if there is any nuances, I am not sure statistically there is a lot of variation. We do tend to have a surge of orders at the end of every year on the LDA side as I had mentioned, it’s because only half the business at capital equipment, it tends not be as high as you typically see in Keysight, but Mike if you have some thoughts and then Fred. Yes. Just to build on Bill’s comments, geographically I think the story we have already talked about China and the strong close there. We also saw in the United States and in Europe. And I think those three geographies really drove the results for the quarter. And just to repeat some of the earlier commentary in terms of strength in the food market, which continues to globally very strong market for us, even with the government push-up in China in terms of major projects. And I said earlier, the return to growth in the chemical and energy space is really promising to see. Yes. Also building on the Mike’s comments, I think we talked about the pharmaceutical industry and I think you will see a slight uptick in the second half. I mean, we talked about the academia and government market, we believe there will be some relief of the budgets that we can participate. And I think Europe in general as Mike said was going quite well. So, from that perspective, I think we are positive that we can deliver the results Didier was referring to. Thanks. And then Didier, I didn’t hear you mentioned our expected share count for end of the year. Should we still expect about 100 million of share repurchase activity in the back half? We have – last time at the analyst meeting we talked about spending $400 million over the next, I mean this year – over this year and next. So far, we have got $115 million this fiscal year and we will see. In terms of the share count, you can assume for the projections 338 million shares in Q3 and 339 million shares in Q4. Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. This is Robert for Patrick this afternoon. Couple of questions. We talked a lot about China and LDA. I am just wondering, Ron, if you could perhaps decide on how EMG fared in China, any impacts from the LTE rollout? We, as I mentioned earlier on a broad basis that we did very well in base station infrastructure build. There is a lot of manufacturing that goes on in that area, but nothing unique in China this quarter. So, we continue to be very competitive in that space, but nothing significant to report. Great, thank you for that. And sort of staying on the kind of EMG tales, I am wondering if you can provide any update on UXM and how – has that led to an improvement in your position in wireless or have you see any gain in share of the customers you had previously lost share in? Yes. By adding the UXM, which is the R&D wireless test set, we have actually been involved in much more direct conversations, more bids in winning more business than we have done previously. The way it’s typically done is someone will test out the box, figure out if it has the right type of coverage or testing capability. And then it’s a like it enough with one product, they will start using it and then that gets replicated. The response on UXM has been excellent, but the R&D market is not like the manufacturing market, where someone likes it, they will go buy 2,000 of them at once that will rollout in a much slower area. So, R&D, we see a much steadier pace not as volatile, not as fast up, not as fast down, but we are very pleased with both the UXM and the EXM in their competitiveness. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Thank you, Karen. And I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today and wish you all a good day. If you have any questions, please call us at IR and we will be happy to give them an answer. Thank you.

Before turning the call over to Bill, I’d like to remind you that will host its annual analysts meeting in New York City on March 6. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website two weeks prior to that date. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported first quarter orders of $1.68 billion, down 2% from last year and flat on a core basis. Q1 revenues of $1.68 billion were unchanged from a year ago, up 1% on a core basis. While revenues came in at the low end of guidance, adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share were at the high end of the guidance, up 8% from a year ago. Operating margin was 17.6%.  We saw a mixed business environment with continued steady growth in life science and applied markets. This was offset by continued weakness in our electronic measurement markets, particularly in aerospace and defense. Despite some ongoing economic headwinds, we continue to benefit from our commitment to manage expenses and reduce manufacturing costs.  We also continue to make excellent progress in preparing for the split of the company. On January 7, we announced Keysight Technologies as the name of the new EM company. We expect the separation to be completed by early November. As I indicated last quarter, Agilent will increasingly differentiate our electronic measurement and LDA businesses in preparation for the company’s separation. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science diagnostics and applied markets. These businesses will be the focus of the new Agilent, as the company continues under my leadership.  Following my remarks, Ron Nersesian will discuss our electronic measurement performance, which will be the focus of the new spinoff company under his leadership. Finally, Didier Hirsch will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent’s overall financial results as well as our guidance for fiscal second quarter and the full year. Turning to LDA, our first quarter performance continued to show solid revenue growth across instruments, services, and consumables. Q1 revenues of $1 billion increased 5% year over year, reflecting strength across most end markets and a healthy Q4 backlog. Q1 orders of $979 million increased 2% over last year. The slowing in the order growth is driven by weaker demand in academic and government markets. Operating margins were up 210 basis points to 19.2%, consistent with our margin expansion goals for the businesses. We continue to focus on attractive end markets, our leading product portfolio, and significant operational leverage. Our end market performance in LDA was particularly strong in pharmaceutical, biotech, clinical, food, and forensics. Pharma revenue grew 8% year over year, with strength in Europe and Japan offsetting slow demand in the U.S. Food revenues were up 14% over last year, as globalization of the industry continued to drive demand for food safety. Forensics grew 26%, driven by the need to identify and characterize new designer drugs entering the global market. And [energy] was up 3%, led by Europe and large refinery projects in the Middle East.  Conversely, academic and government markets declined 10% year over year. Research spending remains constrained, impacted by slow budget releases, particularly in the U.S. and China. Diagnostics and clinical revenues were up 10%. The [unintelligible] was slow, due to a very slow start for the quarter, but the clinical business was robust, driven by CGH arrays and target enrichment. On a regional basis, LDA performance was mixed. Europe continued to see the strongest regional performance, driven by strength in pharma and services. Asia, ex-Japan, also showed strong growth, while Japan was down primarily due to weak currency. Americas was up slightly, constrained by delayed budget releases in Canada and the United States. Within LDA, our life science and diagnostic group, or LDG, had Q1 revenues of $592 million, up 5% from a year ago. Orders of $554 million were flat year over year, reflecting softer instrument demand in the Americas and China. Operating margin was 17%. We signed a new companion diagnostics agreement with Merck [and Amgen]. Development projects will include treatments for lung, breast, and gastric cancer. And LDG released the third version of our intelligent system emulation technology for our 1290 Infinity LC systems. The new [isat] allows for emulation of competitors’ systems. Our chemical analysis business continues to show strength across both its instruments and reoccurring revenue portfolios. Q1 revenue grew 6% to $417 million, driven by chemical and energy, as well as non-government food safety markets. Q1 orders grew 4% to $412 million. Operating margin was 23%. In the quarter, chemical analysis launched two spectroscopy systems. The new ICP-MS and MP-AES systems introduced more streamlined operational features and a user-friendly interface. This will enable a wider range of applications and improve accessibility to a broader range of lab personnel. LDA’s outlook for fiscal FY2014 remains positive, as the world economy continues to improve and budgets are settled. While the comparisons will get more difficult starting in Q2, we expect growth trends to continue. Our gross margin proven initiatives continue to progress well, and we see additional opportunities to grow share with new product releases in the pipeline. Our priorities will continue to be centered on improving the customer experience, driving organic growth, increasing our margins, and improving our return on invested capital. LDA revenues for the second fiscal quarter of FY14 are expected to be between $995 million to $1.02 billion, or 4.1% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 18.1%. For the full year, we project a revenue range for LDA of $4.03 billion to $4.13 billion. At the midpoint, LDA’s operating margin is expected to be 19.5%. Didier will provide additional details in his commentary. Thank you for being on the call. Now I’ll turn it over to Ron to talk about the electronic measurement business. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. For the first quarter, the electronic measurement group reported orders of $699 million, down 7% year over year. EMG revenues also declined 7% in the quarter to $671 million. While orders were consistent with expectations, the impact of Lunar New Year on our ability to recognize revenue late in the quarter was greater than anticipated.  This resulted in revenues that were below our guidance. The book to bill ratio was 1.04 for the quarter. Despite lower than expected revenues, solid gross margin management and disciplined expense control yielded an operating margin of 15.2%.  Taking a closer look at our end market performance, aerospace and defense revenue declined 27% year over year against a tough compare. The first quarter of FY13 was the peak of our aerospace and defense business, prior to U.S. sequestration budget reductions.  Consistent with the positive signals that I noted last quarter, industrial computers and semiconductor revenue increased 4% year over year, driven by investments in next-generation semiconductor process technologies. Communications revenue declined 5% year over year due to softness in wireless R&D and broadband spending. Wireless manufacturing was up 1% year over year. Long term growth drivers remain intact. Wireless standards continue to evolve, driving investment in emerging network technologies. As a result of two key product introductions, EMG is well-positioned to capitalize on these macro trends. As I’ve said before, we are committed to winning in the wireless ecosystem. In November, we introduced a new modular wireless manufacturing test platform called EXM. It is getting strong reviews for both cellular and wireless land tests, and just two weeks ago, we introduced a major new wireless R&D platform called UXM. Both the manufacturing and R&D platforms have multiformat architectures to support 4G standards and can be upgraded as standards evolve. Another key part of our product strategy is to build a modular product offering that leverages our technology leadership in feature-rich instrumentation. Our modular business continues to gain momentum, with orders for PXI and AXIe offerings again showing strong double-digit growth in Q1.  Shifting from Q1 results, we remain focused on our FY14 priorities which are to launch ourselves as an independent company, focus solely on electronic measurement customers, strengthen our position in wireless communications and modular solutions, and to continue to generate strong profit margins for our shareholders. As Bill commented about the split, I am pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to separate EMG from Agilent. On January 7, we announced the name of our new company as Keysight Technologies. As we plan to begin operating under the Keysight Technologies name as a subsidiary of Agilent, effective August 1, the spinoff is expected to occur in November. Despite the extensive work involved with the separation, we remain intensely focused on managing our business without interruption and delivering the quality, innovation, and service that our customers deserve and expect. Turning to our outlook for Q2, Keysight revenues are expected to be in the range of $705 million and $745 million. We expect operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.2%. With expected growth of approximately 8% in the second half of FY14, revenues are now expected to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $3.0 billion, or 2% core growth at the midpoint for FY14. We expect operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.7%. Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our revenue, adjusted for $5 million of unfavorable currency, was $6 million, or 0.4%, below the midpoint of our guidance, but our EPS was $0.01 over. Once again, we were able to deliver on our EPS commitment thanks to our disciplined management of expenses, in line with our operating model. Please note that that Q1 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported in the slide deck, posted on our website. This quarter, currency subtracted about 1.5 percentage points from our year over year revenue growth and acquisitions had no material impact. A final note on Q1, we bought back $100 million of stock in Q1, and therefore completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized by the board in May of 2013. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our second quarter. We expect Q2 revenues of $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion and EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. At the midpoint, revenue will grow 1% on a core basis. Our 18.2% projected operating margin at the midpoint will be 60 basis points higher than in Q1, and 110 basis points lower than Q2 of last year.  Remember that we initiated a drastic cut in discretionary expenses early February of last year that resulted in over $30 million of expense savings in Q2 last year, so we face a tough compare. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we’re also investing in key growth initiatives.  Now to the revised guidance for fiscal year 2014. We’re now expecting fiscal year ’14 revenues to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and at the midpoint this translates into 3.6% core revenue growth. As stated by Ron, EMG has revised down its midpoint revenue guidance by $55 million, to a year over year core growth of 2%. Midpoint operating profit guidance for EMG has been reduced by $35 million and operating margin guidance at the midpoint is 18.7%. At the same time, LDA has increased its midpoint revenue guidance by $5 million to a year over year core growth of 5%. Midpoint operating profit guidance is increased by $4 million, leading to an operating margin midpoint of 19.5%. Agilent EPS is now projected to range from $2.96 to $3.16 and the midpoint of $3.06 is down $0.12 from the November guidance, which represents a reduction of $0.13 coming from EMG offset by an increase of $0.01 from LDA. I’m trying to walk through the math on guidance here. You’ve cut revenues by $15 million. If you assume maybe a 6% decremental, then you’re talking $25 million to EBIT or $0.06. So why are you cutting the bottom line so much? Maybe just talk about why you don’t have additional leverage you could call to maybe offset some of the impact on earnings? As I mentioned, the $55 million revenue decline for EM triggers $35 million operating profit decline. And I’ll let Ron just talk about the incremental decremental. With regards to the decremental, we’ve looked at that closely, and we are anticipating growth of 8% in the second half. And accordingly, we are continuing to invest to bring up new platforms that we think will drive that growth in the second half. And just to follow up, Ron, in your comments you talked about the latest from the Chinese, that looked bigger. Can you maybe just talk to us about whether things have picked up post the quarter and do you expect those delays to come through in the first half? Our orders were right on expectation at $699 million. What happened was we built about $15 million in pipeline due to Lunar New Year. So this is basically products that we’ve received orders for, we shipped, but we’re not able to recognize revenue because of the way Lunar New Year fell. We anticipated and forecasted that to a certain extent, but it was greater than what we thought. We plan to flush that backlog, that $15 million worth of backlog in Q2, as well as have a sequential increase of $39 million to bring our revenue up $54 million in Q2.  Ron, could you elaborate a little more just on the puts and takes to the EMG guidance takedown? What are you factoring for the aerospace and defense business? And if you could give us a view around the comms segment, that would be helpful. For the aerospace and defense segment, that is the biggest segment that really is driving the change. We had expected that to be flat. It actually was down 27% because of the tough compare. So in particular for the year, we’re moving it from flat for the year to down 5%. The comms business, we were forecasting 3% growth before, and now for the year 2% growth. And industrial computer and semi, we were forecasting 5% growth, and we still are. And that business has been turning, especially in the semiconductor space. So the decline is basically driven in the aerospace defense spending. Even though the budget was approved in September, it’s been a slow start. We have seen more acceleration towards the end of Q1 on quote activity and orders start to pick up, but we do believe that there’s a bit of a lag in that recovery.  Could you talk about the [unintelligible] PXI and the dynamics surrounding PXI versus the box business. You know, double digit PXI would suggest you’re, I guess, keeping share. But is the market on the box side coming down? And so can you talk a little bit about share and also the dynamics of box versus PXI? The box business is much greater than the PXI or the modular business, and it continues to be so, but we are building our modular offering because that provides advantages for certain customers. Our modular business is relatively small, and it continues to grow. We’ve stated that it’s roughly $100 million in the past. Last quarter we saw approximately 50% growth and this quarter it was well into double digits, getting close to that same 50% number. So we are seeing traction. At first we brought out some of the infrastructure products, and now we’re coming out with core RF and wireless products to go forward.  As a matter of fact, the platform that we had for manufacturing is a modular platform that we just introduced, and the reviews on that product are very, very good. We’re very pleased with it.  Where do you think market share is? Any change? Is there a gain? Is there a loss? What’s your thought there? We’re definitely gaining share in the PXI market. There’s no doubt about it. I believe our growth is quicker at roughly 50% the last two quarters. But we will continue to work on that. That is a multiyear strategy that we’ll continue to drive over the next five plus years, until we’re number one. On the academic budgets, I want to ask a little bit about the comments there. It seemed like across the rest of the industry in life sciences there was decent fourth quarter budget flushes. So if you could put some color beyond the geographic comments you made there, that would be helpful. I’ll make a comment about China, which is more difficult, then turn it over to Fred to talk about the U.S. Again, a lot of these is who your customer base is, and exactly where you are in the process. Clearly, in China and there, our belief in January was a slowdown in terms of commitments in academic and research. And that was impacted by the Lunar New Year. So I don’t think that we’re going to get a really solid feel to exactly where our position will be in academic and research until Q2. And I’ll have Fred comment about the U.S., which is obviously a large market.  I think, you know, the NIH [unintelligible], if you look at the NIH [project], we’ve defended it for a large piece of the spending. You see that this is below the spending of 2012. And if you look to the pattern of things which are sold at the moment, there is some hesitation to spend the money on instrumentation as well as on services and consumables, and this is a consideration as we see it at the moment. And I’ll put my editorial on it again. Not to make an excuse, but every time Lunar New Year is in our January, or our Q1, we have a lot of anomalies that are difficult, and unfortunately it only shows up every three or four years. But if you go back over that period of time, it is always an interesting quarter to describe when we have this event. And then just as a follow up, if I could, on Dako, I don’t think I heard it, but if you could give the growth in the quarter there, that would be great. And just if you had any updated views regarding long term strategy here, on moving the [genomics] business in there along with diagnostics. And wondering if we might see some meaningful updates to the strategy for that combined asset base before the deal closes. Again, we combined the two organizations between the clinical and our pathology. We’re absolutely convinced our array CGH business as well as our target enrichment is going, and we had a very, very robust growth rate. But we did have a slow quarter versus our Q4. I’ll have Fred make a couple of comments about the pathology specifically, and any other color commentary regarding genomics. The pathology business, as Bill said, was indeed a bit weak. We have pulled in a lot of orders in Q4 of last year. That was one effect. And quite honestly, if you look to the first quarter of fiscal year ’13, this also was impacted by an artifact so that at the moment, Q1 looks a bit low. I think we believe the demand for pathology is pretty robust, and in particular, as Bill mentioned, we see a lot, in particular in the clinical space, I think the micro arrays are outgrowing by far, at the moment, our competitors. Sure [fisher] is making inroads into the market, and by the way, also the microfluidics business is growing double digits, mid double digits, and this together gives a good footprint in the clinical space with the genomics products we are providing.  I guess I’m still struggling a little bit in some of the deltas for the quarter, particularly as we look at aerospace and defense. We sort of came into the year, as you said, [unintelligible] flat, and now we’re down 5, but we just had a down 27, when I think last quarter we were down at about 11. So it was a pretty big deterioration. I’m just trying to get a sense for how something like that is so difficult to forecast. Or did it come in closer to where your forecast is and then the comps are going to drive it, etc.? I’m just not sure I totally understand. I know the Lunar New Year and some of the other factors, but I’m just trying to see what transpired maybe from a pacing perspective to where this was so difficult to sort out. Our forecast was to exceed the midrange of the guidance all the way up towards the end of the quarter. And right near the middle of January, the middle to second half of January, we received a very substantial number of requests to delay delivery until after Chinese New Year. That happened in China. We also saw some of that in other areas.  In aerospace/defense, the budget was signed in December, but at first what was happening, the end users didn’t know how much money they were going to get, because it wasn’t passed out to them. We actually saw nice acceleration in aerospace/defense right at the end of the quarter, but obviously that did not translate into revenue.  And don’t forget that Q1 ’13 was the largest quarter that we had in over eight quarters, where in Q4 of ’12, people were placing their last orders before sequestration and then we shipped that, about $195 million, in Q1 of ’13. So we had a very high compare on that standpoint. So aerospace/defense, basically it was a very slow start to spending the money that picked up at the end of the quarter, and then in China, we saw some pushouts, and two orders alone accounted for $11 million worth of the delta. On the guide, the two things that are sort of perplexing to me, or I would say three, one, it seems like some of the issues we had were temporal and there are some assumptions of improvement, and yet sort of the guide, it doesn’t feel as if it reflects all of that. It seems as if you sort of took it down, at least on the revenue side, by more than the delta. So I’m a little bit confused there.  And then on the dropdown, again, to Tycho’s point, it seems like the decrementals are pretty substantial, just relative to the revenue change. Was there any thought process to maybe do more on the cost side? I know it’s always tough, but we’re sort of looking at an earnings picture here that’s similar to where we were four years ago.  So it’s been a pretty frustrating period, I know. Just trying to sense the temporal versus structural nature of some of this, because the guidance implies some of it’s temporal and some of it’s not. So I’m trying to sort out how you thought through that.  From a management perspective, the thinking was very straightforward. Recovery of electronic measurement or [unintelligible] was in the second half of the year. That was the assumption of the guidance. We had a difficult Q1 to interpret. So we’re going into Q2 with quite frankly a fair amount of uncertainty because of the issue that Ron outlined very, very well.  So then the question that comes in is if we don’t change the guidance, then the second half recovery is just enormous, and I think that that would set wrong expectations. So we said if Q2 is what we think it’s going to be, then the second half snap back can’t make up the difference from the first half. So that’s logic number one, and hope we’re wrong, but that’s the logic path that we went in.  On the expense side, we’re in a big Catch 22. We have to win in modules. We have to win in communication. We’ve got to get these new products out. LDA has a whole string of products, and so to take draconian expense cuts, given this uncertainty that we have, also is I don’t think the right answer. And so we made those two tradeoffs moving forward, and try to lay out to investors the best we can what we think will happen, given the problems that we had in Q1 in electronic measurement and the continued uncertainty going forward. And just one follow up. What about on the repo side? You’ve obviously got some flexibility. Stock will be down 5%. I think it’s over that now. I mean, I know there was a lot of hesitance to do that before the split. How much will the volatility and what we’re seeing here, if you do believe somewhat in the recovery thesis, how much does that sort of push you to consider maybe ramping that up a bit? We have been authorized by the board to maintain our share count at I believe it’s 335, and this quarter we’re actually at 338. So yes, we have the cash available, and yes, we have the authorization to continue to make stock repurchases. Let me just make sure that I understand, just to follow up on Ross’s question, the surprises in the quarter were really twofold, one being the Lunar New Year pushouts, and one being the weakness in the aerospace and defense market. Is that correct? Yes. In the short term, the Lunar New Year had a $15 million effect, and we were $19 million off the center of guidance and $9 million off the low end of the range, and the aerospace/defense picture, we believe, will be a slower recovery than we had anticipated before.   And I guess Ron, I think you mentioned that your orders were actually in line with expectations. I’m just trying to square those two comments in my mind. Yes, orders were fine, and that means that our Q2 guidance we could have met if we didn’t have the $15 million delays in the actual revenue recognition or customer acceptance. Longer term, for the second half, we just think that the aerospace/defense market, given its hole in Q1, and given where it’s coming from, is going to be a little bit slower.  So as Bill had mentioned, we have a real hockey stick, from roughly 7% decline in Q1, and we’re forecasting an 8% increase in growth in the second half, so we are expecting a significant upturn. And we’ve seen things like Europe. Europe has posted growth for seven months in a row. That feels very good. The semiconductor market overall feels very good. But there are other mix things that would cause us not to count on more than 8% growth in the second half. So just sort of looking at some of your more government exposed spending, correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe that your environmental forensics, core was down like 7% in Q3 ’13, it was flat Q4, up 7%. You know, is that environmental that’s rebounding there? Or if it is environmental, is it outside of the U.S. that’s doing that? I’m just curious, that also does have some government exposure to it. As you know, we report the combined environmental forensic number externally. The story there actually, and it was a nice surprise, is the strength of the forensics business. And it was up fairly significantly in Q1. A lot of it is being driven by concerns about designer drugs and drugs abuse testing on a global basis, particularly we’re doing very well with various police and security authorities globally. So that’s been a real area of strength for us in the first quarter.  I would tell you that in the more developed countries, particularly in the United States, budgets remain quite sluggish. But I will tell you it’s a different picture than it was last year, which was we knew we were facing sequestration. This year we know the budgets have been restored in certain agencies such as the EPA. We haven’t yet seen those budgets being released. So I hope that gives you some clarity. Yes, the OMIX platform is picking up as we speak. We have shipped a couple of dozen in the latest quarter. The feedback we are getting back from our customers remains positive. And we have put a couple of new assays during the quarter on the platform as well. We are just rolling the product out as the others come in.  And just one final question, have you done any more work in terms of looking at the tax implications of the spend, and just how the tax rates are going to fall? Yes, we have. I apologize for not answering it directly, but we will share that in the Mach analyst day meeting. But we are very, very close to determining essentially what the tax rate will be for the new Agilent moving forward, and the range for our key sites in there. But please wait until March, and we will have that.  I think it’s important that I don’t give the number now, because the Form 10 will be published right before that, and then you will get a historical perspective of what the actual tax rates have been for what the two companies have been if they were independent. So I think it’s good to see the total answer in context moving forward. I continue to say that we are taking the opportunity to look at ways to ensure that we have sufficient cash in the U.S. Obviously Keysight has to have sufficient cash in the U.S. moving forward, and so there will be some tweaking of the overall tax rate. Bill, on the first quarter, on the LDA side, the area of life science and diagnostics, if we look at the gap between order and revenues, trying to go back in history a little bit, it looks a little bit out of the ordinary from a historical perspective. You mentioned you had [unintelligible] demand in the U.S. and China, but anything else that kind of ends up [unintelligible] in terms of the orders [unintelligible]? No, I think as Fred said, there’s clearly a lot of orders that were pulled into the last month of our Q4. The start off in November was terrible. We ended in January, I think, quite fine, I think a 7% growth rate, but we had a terrible start to the quarter. And I don’t know if we’ve trained all of our new employees about how the compensation system works at Agilent, for many, many decades, but nonetheless, we just had a terrible start to Q1.  January was fine, so basically some of the order shortfall in November got booked in October is basically what I’m saying, and we exited the quarter on the runway, and we think that we’re going to have solid growth as we move forward. But we did have a slow start to our Q1. Hey, Bill, can I add some initial commentary from the chemical analysis side, which is, as you know, we have a large footprint of our businesses in Asia, so the story of Chinese New Year really did impact us, because we lost basically a good week or so worth of quarter end orders. And then also, back to the comments on U.S. government spending, I know earlier we were focusing on the life science implications of the U.S. government spending, but also it had a material impact on the results for CA in terms of the order rates coming in for the first quarter, albeit it’s a much different story than it was a year ago, because budgets have been restored, and we just need to wait for them to be released. And then, if I could just ask the question, maybe a little bit of a two-parter here, you talked about emerging markets like they’re one country. Obviously they’re all individual countries. Historically Agilent has had a nice, strong presence there. [unintelligible] has been a little bit less robust recently, so I guess one, can you give us some color about how you’re seeing the forecast in those markets for you for the rest of your ’14?  And then maybe tying that into strong EM business, maybe help me understand what gives you confidence that you will see that 8% growth in the second half. Historically, I know there’s always been a bit of a hockey stick, but talking to competitors now, everyone seems to say that they’re not seeing it yet, and I guess what are the major drivers this time around? I’ll make a couple of comments on the LDA side, and then turn it over to Ron on the Keysight side. Again, our non-GAAP in East Asia business grew 8%. Obviously China/Korea was very, very strong for us in the quarter. India continues to struggle. I think in the Americas, Brazil has its challenges moving forward. And so there are issues out there that we have to address, but quite frankly China just dominates the position for LDA. So how China goes, that’s how our emerging markets will go. As far as emerging markets, we sell in aerospace/defense to some of the emerging markets, in particular Russia, a little bit to India, and some to China. And we saw those markets were soft. As a matter of fact, if you add them up, like some other competitors have announced previously, our orders were off 16% in Q1 in the emerging markets. And again, that’s an overlay with aerospace/defense in certain areas. So that’s the environment that we’re seeing there, which tends to correlate with the guidance that we have going forward. The things that make us excited is when we look at the second half, Europe continues to be strong, from the standpoint that it’s grown seven months in a row. And we had two major product platforms that we’ll start shipping in the second half. One is the wireless manufacturing platform, which is a modular based platform that’s getting excellent reviews, and the latest is the new one that we just announced a couple of weeks ago, which is a new wireless R&D platform. And just to give you an idea, this platform is the latest and greatest. It’s up there, and customers have been giving us reviews saying it’s the best platform that exists on the market. It handles LTE advanced and category six data rates up to 300 megabits. It does carrier aggregations, all the latest things. And it has integrated fading, which is typically something that someone would have to buy a [unintelligible] product and hook it up with their wireless product in order to make the solution happen.  So when we take a look at the strength of the products, the feedback that we’ve had in these areas, how Europe has turned around, and also how things are starting to pick up in some other areas, that gives us the confidence for the second half. Ron, one clarification. You sized your PSI business at roughly $100 million. I’m curious if that’s a trailing 12-month basis, or is that from annualizing current quarterly results? And I guess I was curious, when you talked about the drivers for the [unintelligible] in the second half, you didn’t mention necessarily the Chinese opportunity, and you didn’t really mention wireless test directly. I guess you did talk about your two major product lines. So I’m curious, can you update us on timing or opportunity with China Mobile? I think you previously sized that at, I think, a $30 million annual opportunity. And can you talk about wireless test and expectations there? There’s no doubt with our new platform that’s coming out, we are gaining momentum. If you look at two areas where we probably had the biggest product holes on a competitive basis, it was in the wireless manufacturing and wireless R&D platforms. And we have really come a very long way in those areas within the past year. With regard to China Mobile, for the TDD/LTE spectrum, it was awarded to all three players ahead of schedule. Commercial licenses have been issued, and China Mobile plans to put in place 500,000 LTE base stations in 340 Chinese cities. And we’re very much engaged in that. Obviously Ericsson is number one in share, Huawei two, NSM three, and Alcatel Lucent four, and we are very strong in the base station area, and will continue to try to win that business. And I guess going back to the wireless test side, you had a competitor that said that the market compressed from about a $1.3 billion opportunity to $1 billion since 2013. Do you agree with that assessment? And two, do you expect that the competition is going to continue to compress that market in 2014? Or should that industry come back to growth? We see growth in communications for us. We have forecasted a 2% growth for the year. The market’s probably flat. There are two things that are going on there. We’re obviously seeing the unit volume increases from 1.8 billion phones or the 1 billion smartphones that are being produced today.  But you also do see some price erosion that goes on as we’ve seen more consolidation in the marketplace, and you’ve seen a couple of the smartphone manufacturers actually put a little bit more pressure on the market.  The good thing about this market is these standards continue to evolve. They are very highly complex technical challenges, and accordingly, we seem to offset that with our business in R&D or by having leading edge technology. But looking at all that, we still see that 2% growth when you factor in the unit growth and the pricing situation.  And last one, I guess for Bill, there’s some components and subsystem suppliers in your academic and government food chain that are seeing an uptick in demand, especially in North America, given the Ryan Murray budget deal. And although you reported this area as being a soft area for you in the quarter, I’m curious if you’ve seen any impact at all from the budget deal. I’m not sure that I know. No, there’s nothing for us. Again, we’ve been a late entry into that market since our program that we made in triple quad and [unintelligible], and obviously in our genomics area. And so I’m not sure that our own issues are somewhat unique to what our investment strategy is and exactly who those customers are. So we’re not of knowledge that any particular impact good or bad, versus the [unintelligible] that you had asked about. My first question is on the decrementals again. I mean, the decrementals implied in the EMG guidance are, to be fair, pretty surprising. If we go back 12 to 18 months, you said you couldn’t cut spending any more in [EMC] without cutting into bone. Then last year you found ways to cut a lot more than people expected. Now it doesn’t seem like you’re getting to the leverage one would have expected to see if the cuts you had made in the second half of last year were sustainable. In hindsight, did you guys cut too far last year? And has something changed that suggest that you now need to invest more in what appears to be a more challenging environment than you had anticipated? There’s no doubt we cut very deeply, and I would say that we were on edge. There are a couple of product areas where we really needed to invest and win. It’s as simple as that. The wireless one box testers, we talked about those key products. And again, we’re in this for the long haul. We don’t want to be short sighted. If we didn’t anticipate an upturn that would be coming within quarters, we would potentially do something different. But given how important it is for us to be number one, and given what we see coming, we believe that this is in the best interest of the shareholders and they’ll be happy for it over time. The last few quarters you talked about picking up share in areas like LC and to an extent mass-spec. And looking at your results, it’s not clear that that continued into Q1, especially when you look at your growth and how it compares to your peers. And related to this, it doesn’t seem like your pharma growth was nearly as robust as some of your peers. What was different this quarter for you? Again, be very careful comparing quarter to quarter, particularly given our quarter is off all of our competitors. We had a very strong end of the year. Our competitors had a very strong close at their end of the year. You really have to look at the rolling four quarters when you look at Agilent moving forward.  If you in fact look at the organic growth rate, the last four, we’re basically at the overall market. I would argue the second half of the last two quarters we have been slightly above that. At the beginning of the year we were slightly below that moving forward.  But again, I’d be very cautious of making those comparisons, because I’m sure that many people ask our competitors, how come Agilent had such a great four? And again, I think you’ve got to really normalize it on a calendar day to really get a true view of what the true organic growth rate is. Bottom line is, last four quarters we were basically growing at the overall market, which we believe is about 5% organic growth rate. And even this quarter, we’ve grown 6.4% on the currency adjusted. Taking into account the fact that we had China New Year, which our competitors don’t, and last year it wasn’t there, it was in February. All good points, but to be fair, you guys were the ones who proactively said you were picking up share in some of these areas. Do you still believe you’re picking up share? I am very cautious on market share. All the comment was is that our growth in the fiscal year was higher at that point in time than the competition. Then they ended their fiscal year and you saw that little bit of shift moving forward. We are very, very cautious on doing it. The competition is very, very good. They have their up and down quarters, we have our up and down quarters, specifically in areas that we have done well, such as the LC, other areas that we have been below the market. And so in aggregate, right now, if you look at where everyone is today, plus our additional month, we’re roughly, non currency adjusted, at a 5% organic growth rate, which is the weighted average of the market.  And last question, and I think it’s an important one, even though right now it’s not a huge part of your business, as we look ahead, and we think about the company post-split, one of the things that’s got people excited about the story is the prospects of life sciences being an above-market grower with the potential to really expand margins at your growth levels. But one important component of that is really anatomical pathology growing strongly, and you guys did talk about not having a great quarter there. And again, one quarter doesn’t make a trend, but can you tell us, were autostainer placements about where you expected them to be, or was that a source of weakness in the quarter relative to plan? No, as Fred said, our placement is going exactly as we want it to do. I’ve also been very clear that we are taking a very deliberate path to install, to ensure that the equipment works, that there aren’t issues moving forward, that we have the right products that are validated on it, that we have new releases. And again, we’ve said this for many years, this is going to be a slow, methodical process. We did not want to get ourselves in a situation where we overextend ourselves, we get placements in place that aren’t performing to what we believe the instrument can perform. So we are systematically engaging, as Fred said, and installing a dozen systems every quarter. Maybe just two on the cost within the P&L. In the past, you guys have talked a little bit about your ability to, within your model, take down fixed costs in addition to some of the variable portions if you do need to. How much of a lever are you actually finding that to be at this point? And I guess the follow up, what portion of the cost structure is actually variable at this point? I’m going to go back to the broad strategic decision. We, based on our guidance, given the uncertainty, are not going to pull the trigger right this moment to dramatically reduce our variable spending. We could do that, Didier talked about it. We did a year ago and took $30 million out. All of the triggers that we have in place still exist. There is too much uncertainty in the quarter to execute that.  The issue clearly is in Keysight. [Ron’s story], soon to be a large shareholder, is all about growth, and we have to continue to execute on the programs that we have had. And obviously Ron and the team, as they move forward the new board - in fact, if you don’t have the [unintelligible], you can pull those triggers. So we can do that tomorrow. It is quite easy to pull the triggers. All the variable components that we have in place are exactly the way they were in the past. But just given the outlook it is, I’m in 100% support of Ron and his decision to continue to execute the plan and be realistic on what the second half recovery can be, and not just sit here today at the beginning of the year and hope for somehow you’re going to get a huge growth in the second half of the year. And I just don’t want to set unrealistic expectations.  Any split costs you guys have in your assumptions for guidance for the rest of the year? Or is it probably the same thing, the 25 that you saw this quarter and the pull through? No, we’ll give more detail in the March meeting. But in terms of the split cost, what we will say is that the one-time separation costs will be higher than what we said before. We’re doing two things. One is we’re accelerating and expanding the branding of Keysight, and I think that’s clearly a worthwhile investment. And we are making greater progress on the separation than we had alluded to. The outcome of that will be that the synergy costs on the Keysight side are going to be minimal, and the synergies on the Agilent side are going to be higher, just because of the great job the team has done in separating. As a result of that, for example, the service agreements that Agilent was soon to provide to Keysight, there are not going to be that many service sites. Again, we are making superb progress in setting up the IT systems, separating the real estate, setting up all the systems to ensure that Keysight can be a very credible, established company from the get go. But other than the shift back and forth, there isn’t any substantive material change than what we’ve talked about, in my opinion.   Thank you, operator, and just wanted to say thank you, everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I’d like to wish you a good day. '"

       "'Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I\\'ll be your operator for today.  As a reminder, today\\'s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\\'am. Thank you, Keith, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s First Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2012. With me are Agilent\\'s President and CEO, Bill Sullivan; as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian; and the Presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis Groups, Guy Sene, Nick Roelofs and Mike McMullen.  You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please check -- click on the link for Financial Results, where you will find revenue breakouts and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. For any non-GAAP financial measures, you will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.  Before turning the call over to Bill, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its annual Analyst Meeting in New York City on March 8. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent Investor Relations website 2 weeks prior. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Agilent\\'s Q1 orders of $1.62 billion were flat versus last year. Q1 revenues of $1.64 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 per share, and operating margin was 19%. We generated $150 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in net cash. Our Q1 performance was a solid start to fiscal year 2012. Electronic Measurement revenues were $778 million, up 1% over last year. Operating margin was 21% of revenue, a 58% increment for the quarter. We saw strength in Aerospace and Defense, up 5%; industrial, computer and semiconductor markets were up 6%, with strength in the industrial subsegment partially offset by continued weakness in computer and semiconductors. We also saw an unexpected decline in the communications markets, down 8% year-over-year. The causes were twofold. First, there was the decline in wireless infrastructure or base stations for global network equipment manufacturers. This was coupled with a substantial decrease in demand from Chinese infrastructure vendors. Second, there was a significant decrease in investment in RF component supply chain. This decline overwhelmed our double-digit growth in handset test. While we believe this is a pause, we are taking a conservative position in our guidance. In our bioanalytical measurement businesses, you\\'ll recall that a year ago, we experienced some revenue delays from the Varian integration. This resulted in easier compares for our first quarter in fiscal year 2012.  Chemical Analysis revenues of $396 million were up 14% year-over-year. Operating margin was 22%. Life Sciences revenues of $461 million were up 14% over a year ago. Operating margin was 14%. All key markets remained strong. Environmental revenue was up 16% year-over-year, food was up 14%, and petrochemical grew 14%. Pharma and biotech was up 18%, while academic and government grew 7%. We made a number of announcements in the first quarter. First, with our continued focus on maximizing Agilent\\'s operations and improving gross margins, we named Ron Nersesian to the position of Chief Operating Officer. Ron led the recent transformation of our Electronic Measurement business. Under Ron, we also centralized Agilent\\'s order fulfillment operations. The new global organization should better enable us to leverage our worldwide scale and scope in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. For example, we have started shipping NMR sample loading automation and carry UV-Vis spectroscopy products out of Penang. Second, we have registered Agilent Infinity 1200 LC and 6000 MS instruments as Class 1 medical devices with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is an important step for Agilent\\'s strategic initiative in the diagnostics market.  Third, we announced 4 acquisitions in the first quarter. These include Halo Genomics, which expands our SureSelect portfolio and BioSystems Development, which expands our Life Science capabilities and sample prep.  Finally, in January, we announced that Agilent would initiate a quarterly cash dividend. This is a reflection of Agilent\\'s financial strength and continued growth opportunities and underscores our commitment to enhance shareholder value and return.  For the second quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.72 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year remains unchanged. This outlook assumes several factors. One, Electronic Measurement will grow approximately 2% for the remainder of the year; two, we will see continued solid performance in Chemical Analysis and Life Science, resulting in overall Agilent growth rate of approximately 5%. Revenue growth will be back half loaded, and we will have easier year-over-year comparisons. And finally, we will continue to deliver market-leading products while we make progress in optimizing our order fulfillment operations.  Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As always, my comments will refer to non-GAAP figures. Agilent first quarter results reflected the soundness of our operating model. Revenues adjusted for the changes in exchange rates since last quarter were at the low end of our guidance, while EPS of $0.69 was at the high end of the range, as operating expenses were well-managed. Indeed, the first quarter year-over-year operating margin incremental of 39% was at the high end of our 30% to 40% operating model of expectations.  Let me start with Q1 orders and revenues. Orders of $1.62 billion were flat from one year ago and down about 1 point in constant currency. Segment orders adjusted for currency reflected a 6% decline in EMG, while LSG and CAG grew 4% and 3%, respectively. Regional order growth rates in constant currency were 6% growth in the Americas, a 2% decline in Europe, 3% growth in Japan and a 7% decline in the rest of Asia Pacific.  Revenues of $1.64 billion increased 7% from one year ago, both at current and constant exchange rates. Both CAG and LSG revenues grew 14% or 13% at constant currency. Adjusted for last year\\'s Varian revenue delays mentioned by Bill, CAG grew 7% and LSG grew 11%. EMG revenues increased 1% versus the strong prior-year comparison and were flat on a currency-adjusted basis. EMG\\'s excess backlog due to capacity constraints has now been shipped. Regional revenue growth rates in constant currency were 3% growth in the Americas, 4% growth in Europe, 10% growth in Japan and 12% growth in the rest of Asia Pacific. Our regional breakdown of revenue was largely consistent with prior periods, with 35% coming from the Americas, 26% from Europe, 28% from Asia less Japan and 11% from Japan.  Now moving to the income statement. As I have noted in the past, while currency does impact each P&L line, it has minimal impact on our operating margin performance as a result of our geographic diversification and systematic hedging program.  Gross margin of 54.9% was essentially flat versus last year, while operating expenses were well controlled and increased only 2% year-over-year. Consequently, our Q1 operating margin of 19.2% was up 150 basis points versus the same period last year. By segment, EMG\\'s operating margin of 20.6% improved 30 basis points over year-over-year. CAG\\'s operating margin of 22.2% increased 350 basis points year-over-year, and LSG\\'s operating margin of 14.3% was up 240 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income of $244 million or $0.69 per share compared to $212 million and $0.60 per share one year ago, an EPS increase of approximately 15% year-over-year. Turning to the cash flow and our net cash position. Total quarterly cash generated from operations was $150 million, up $30 million compared to the same period last year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at a cost of $34 million. Our net cash position at the end of January was $1.6 billion, an increase of $135 million from the prior quarter and $1 billion higher than one year ago.  Now turning to the guidance of fiscal year 2012. As always, our guidance assumes exchange rates as of the last day of the reported quarter. Although the just-released IMF worldwide GDP growth outlook of 3.25% is 25 basis points lower than the assumption in Agilent\\'s previous revenue guidance, we are not revising the midpoint of our revenue guidance, except for the currency impact.  We believe the most likely economic scenario is indeed a soft first half, followed by a stronger second half. We are projecting a fiscal year \\'12 revenue range of $6.92 billion to $7.02 billion, which is based on exchange rates as of the end of January. At midpoint, our guidance corresponds to a 4% growth in the first half, followed by a 6% growth in the second half, and for the full year, corresponds to a 5% year-over-year revenue growth or 6% in constant currency.  For EPS, we are maintaining the midpoint of our prior fiscal year \\'12 guidance and narrowing the range to $3.13 to $3.23 based on $355 million diluted shares. The midpoint of our EPS guidance at $3.18 reflects 8% growth over our fiscal year \\'11 EPS of $2.95, which is consistent with a year-over-year operating margin incremental in the middle of our 30% to 40% operating model range.  Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we expect Q2 revenues of $1.70 billion to $1.72 billion and EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. Year-over-year currency adjusted revenue growth at the midpoint will be approximately 2%, while the midpoint of our EPS guidance is essentially flat year-over-year after adjusting for the onetime benefit of the non-GAAP tax rate adjustment made in Q2 last year.  Bill, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail around the communications end market. I think that was a bit of a surprise to us as well. Could you talk about some of the different pieces in there? Maybe geographically, what might be leading to your belief that this is more of a temporary slowdown as opposed to something more structural? Right. Yes, it\\'s a great question. And as you said, the -- we were surprised on the reduction in investment for test equipment, both the base station development as well as the component that go into the radio that eventually ends up into the phone. Our overall one-box tester that we use for cellphone testing was fine. So needless to say, Ron and Guy have done a lot of analysis, and I\\'m going to turn it over to Ron and Guy to give their color or commentary of what they\\'re seeing and what they\\'re expecting for the rest of the year. Ron? Thanks, Bill. As Bill had mentioned, the first part of the decline was due to the base station infrastructure build-out. And we saw the decline not only in the global suppliers, but also in the suppliers that are local manufacturers within China. This, we believe, is a pause in the marketplace as we have seen rapid growth over the last 2 years. But there has been a pullback during this most recent quarter. The second part of the slowdown is due to RF components, which get fed into the whole supply chain. And as you know, Agilent has a very, very strong position in base stations and a very, very strong position in RF components. And in both of those, our market positions are stronger in those 2 segments than they are in handsets. So that is why we believe it has affected our business. As we take a look at the forecast going forward, the deals that we have in the funnel, the discussions that we have with our customers and the economic outlook, we\\'ve gone to a conservative estimate of 2% revenue growth for the rest of the year, which correlates with the $3.18 that Didier had mentioned earlier. Guy, would you like to add any other comments? Thank you, Ron. I would just add that yes, China has been the place where we\\'ve been exposed the most with this trend on the base station and the suppliers for base stations. Going forward, we believe that base station and ecosystem for this industry will probably stay slow, while the handset R&D and manufacturing and their suppliers should keep going as planned. And I\\'ll put one additional comment on this. And again, for us having a quarter that goes from October to January, any time Chinese New Year is part of this quarter, we can have surprises over the decades. Fortunately, Chinese New Year is only every 4 years. It\\'s the same quarter as Christmas. So maybe Guy, you could comment on what the outlook\\'s like in February since everybody has returned back to work in China and the rest of the Chinese part of Asia Pacific. Yes, Bill. I would just basically restate that we have seen so far February being on track with our expectations. And as I mentioned, base station and the supply chain for base station would probably stay slow for the rest -- at least for a couple of quarters, with the handset part getting back to -- on track. Okay, that\\'s very, very helpful. And maybe Didier, just a quick one on the LSG and CAG side. You\\'ve talked about investing in the Varian business in the past. And at one point, you mentioned it was breakeven. When can we start to see some of that leverage come through and maybe some of those investments start to roll off? Yes. I mean, we -- as you know, we don\\'t anymore present the Varian separate from Agilent. We\\'re just one company. And you\\'ve seen -- you\\'ve heard like the operating margin improvement significant that both CAG and LSG have demonstrated on a year-over-year basis, which were, I would say, spectacular. This is, for a good part, the impact of the work that has happened in Varian. And it -- this -- we still have some way to go. We\\'ve talked about generating $100 million of cost synergies over 3 to 4 years. The first year was mostly around the SG&A. We are now showing the synergies -- starting showing the synergy on the cost of sales. And I\\'m sure we\\'ll get a chance to talk more about the actions that we are taking. And again, as we have said, both Mike and Nick and their teams, we\\'re in the process of essentially turning every platform that we received through the Varian acquisition to ensure that we have not only a platform that is highly competitive from a measurement standpoint, but also will be able to be manufactured at much lower cost. Unfortunately, that can take easily 2 to 3 years to make that transition. Bill or Ron, I should know this, but I\\'d like some perspective on if the RF components related weakness, is that a channel phenomenon, meaning sell in and sell through, or is that a direct piece of business? I\\'m just looking for if -- we\\'ve heard a lot about distributor inventory destocking in China, and I wonder if this is part of that, or is this completely separate? No, this is typically a direct sell through, whether the RF components that are used for handsets or the RF components that are used for base stations. But if there is, in fact, an over inventory situation in the channel, obviously people are not going to put in on additional capacity. And that\\'s the big wild card. By definition, as you manage through any inventory adjustment, people will put in additional capacity on the manufacturing side. How much of it was just a disruption as an artifact to the quarter, how much of it is an oversupply of components in the channel. Because not only are we not talking about power amplifiers, we\\'re talking about filters. We\\'re talking about capacitors. We\\'re talking about PC boards. I mean, there\\'s a whole -- all kinds of bits and pieces that go into a radio module just on the handset. And obviously, there are a lot of similar components that go into the base station. Understood. So Bill, basically this happens when a phone manufacturer takes down their unit forecasts and therefore, they have to work off whatever they -- so basically, excess versus their prior forecast. Is that basically the effect we\\'re talking about? Well essentially, absolutely. The overall demand on the end products is going to affect the supply chain. Typically, as you know in the semiconductor industry, the supplies always tend to get ahead of the overall demand. What has been difficult is we\\'ve had 2 natural disasters over a relatively short recent period, right between earthquake and flooding. And so I think in my own opinion, being an old semiconductor guy, that\\'s why it\\'s been so hard to read the semiconductor supply chain right now. As you know, the SIA forecast and some Varian organizations are believing that we\\'re in a pause period, and we\\'ll improve in the second half. If that\\'s the case, then just like we said, everything will be fine. But the signal and noise ratio right now is pretty high. All right. I appreciate that color. My follow up for Didier, I think you mentioned the -- you burned all of the backlog in the first quarter in EMG, but it looks like the difference between bookings and revenue is only about $20 million, and I thought that number was 50. So any commentary around or color around that would be great. And I just want to make sure, EMG for the second quarter is below 2% growth, is that right? And it basically accelerates in the back half in your guidance? Accelerates a little bit in the back half, yes. But it\\'s -- yes, it\\'s still a positive growth in the second quarter, accelerates slightly for the second half because we are talking about 2% growth for the 3 quarters. Not much -- and not an enormous acceleration in our conservative forecast, as Bill mentioned. So on the first question, Jon, I mean, if you look at our EMG backlog since in the last 3 quarters, it has come down $68 million in the last 3 quarters. And so we believe that we are now -- we have the right level of backlog. There\\'s no more capacity constraint as we have experienced. There\\'s always adjustments. Probably, the hardware component of the backlog will come -- probably come down further, but then the software component will increase. So net-net, I think that the best assumption is that we are now at a level of backlog that is not hampered by any kind of capacity constraints and therefore, anything that had to be shipped has been shipped. Just wondering, either Bill or Didier, if you can give us a little sense of how trends progressed throughout the quarter? Was the communications drop-off largely a trend you saw in December? Or could you just give us a little color as to how things progressed throughout the quarter? That would be helpful. Yes, we did -- the communication drop-off really happened end of December. We -- early December, we were pretty confident on what we were seeing still, and it happened end of December and then across January, with end of January being stronger again. Yes, a point to mention is that a significant portion of the orders were acquired right at the end of the quarter, so we typically see this type of pattern when people are holding on to purchase orders and they\\'re delaying the capital purchases. So the last week of the quarter was a higher percentage of the quarter than we typically see. And is this changing your way in terms of thinking about cost structure at all? In other words, do you have to step up investment here or alternatively pull back a little bit in light of the communications drop-off? Yes. From my opinion, it\\'s too early to tell because right in this period of time, you had a major shutdown similar to what happens here at Christmas. And so I think the signal noise ratio is high enough. We have a very good record, strong record of reacting quickly. But given what our outlook is, the forecasts we have, we can still make our commitments moving forward. And so we\\'re going to not have any major change to our investment strategy. Okay. And then last one. I guess, as we think about kind of your capital deployment strategy, obviously, you announced the dividend. Should we still think about you trying to repatriate some cash this year? I think it\\'s about $500 million later this year. And should we expect you to prioritize Life Sciences within the M&A strategy? Or how do we think about your priorities? They have not changed at all. You should expect the $500 million at the end of the year. You can tell by the 2 of the acquisitions that I highlighted in my comments that Life Science continues to be our #1 focus, and I asked everyone to write their congressmen to hopefully get a change on the way foreign profits are treated by the United States government. And cash repatriation has no bearing on the -- our capacity to make acquisitions. So we are not limited because we -- the cash is here or there. Acquisitions we can fund one way or another. And so cash repatriation would be potentially just in terms of capital return but has no impact on our willingness and our ability to make acquisitions. So I just want to start again on the comms business. Actually, the statements about base stations weren\\'t very surprising. I think it was not too dissimilar from what we heard from Aeroflex, Danaher, and National Instruments as well. But on the RF component side, it\\'s a little surprising. And I\\'m just wondering if you think there\\'s any competitive issue in that market for you. No, I don\\'t believe there is. We\\'re on top of these customers. As a matter of fact, the customers that did not purchase or that declined, we\\'re working on them right now and working on deals that will close as we go forward as opposed to business that has transferred to any other supplier. Great. And we\\'ve talked a lot today about this incrementally weaker outlook in the EMG segment, in comms and RF components. When we look at Q2 coming in a little lighter than I think what the consensus expectation was on the top line, is any of that coming from the other 2 segments, or is that all in EM? We have -- when we take a look at all the segments, we saw aerospace defense come in stronger than we had expected at first, and again, the signing of the bill by Obama at the end of the year has helped us, and we\\'ve seen some money flow up. So that segment appears to be strong. Our industrial segment also appears to be strong. We do take a look at what our order rate is in the previous quarter and what is shippable, so that has an effect on the seasonality of the revenue that goes -- that comes out the following quarter. I appreciate that. What I was really going for is, are either the LSG or CAG segments incrementally weaker for the quarter relative to the back half? Are either of those pausing as well similar to this comps in market? Sorry, sorry. My apologies, Will, sorry -- comments on the Chemical Analysis side, we are right on the -- our order expectations for Q1, and we\\'re right on the outlook for Q2. So we\\'re right on where we want to be. Yes, well, we\\'re seeing some pretty good strengths. Q2 is always a little soft for us. But we saw a lot of strength. As you saw, the Pharma market really pulling strong, as well as academics. So we\\'re not looking for any big pauses. Yes. If there\\'s any message, even though we -- obviously, the guys have an easier compare because of the Varian\\'s miss of $30 million of revenue a year ago, even if you factor that out, our analytical business continues to be very, very strong. The story here of the quarter is we had a surprise in communications. That surprise, based on our forecast, will not have an impact on the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year. So the -- you\\'re looking for 2% local currency growth at EM. Could you remind us what the LSG and CAG outlooks are for the rest of the year, or how you\\'re factoring those in? Yes, so for -- it\\'s about close to 7% for the whole -- for the remainder of the year for BAM. Okay. And I guess your commentary, the academic markets have been strong. Was that still -- is that both U.S. and Europe, or is that mostly -- or is that still mostly Europe as we saw last quarter? Yes. Actually, the strength was pretty good across the board. Europe was a solid number for us, solid single-digit, and we had double-digit growth in general across the board as the LS total and academics mirrored that, obviously, they weren\\'t double-digit, but they mirrored that regional distribution. So we saw pretty good strength. U.S. still a little bit softer than we had hoped, but as most of you guys saw last 48 hours, Obama put through a proposal for a flat \\'13 NIH budget. So a lot of optimism because that was the nervousness. So we\\'ll see how that translates in orders, that 48-hour-old comment. Well, I don\\'t -- I mean, just from -- certainly from our Washington consultants, it doesn\\'t sound like that there\\'s much hope that, that whatever Obama put forth is going to last and survive whatever Congress decides to do with it. So that may be a little optimistic. On the rest of the end  communications, so I mean are there any signs on the industrial that things are coming in a little bit -- are starting to turn there? And/or are you going to be a little bit softer here? Are you getting any hints at all? What I am getting for is that are we potentially looking for a surprise on the industrial side? The industrial side was incredibly strong. It was pulled down, as we said, on the comms and the semiconductor side. The industrial part of our business was well above expectations, and again, I have Ron and Guy make some comments about where we\\'re getting the strength on the industrial side. So on the industrial side, we have a very broad portfolio that plays into the different marketplaces. And that we saw that and we had double-digit growth in that segment this quarter. So things look very, very good in that area. Automotive is a place where we have seen some strength, and I\\'ll let Guy make any other comments. Yes, and I would say our overall industrial computer and semiconductor was up 6% in Q1. We see this ease down, obviously, to -- as we say for EMG, at 2% total for the rest of the year. Some of the very strong business we got, for instance, both test activities were very good in Q1 and also some very good automotive business. The double-digit number I was referring to was just the -- was the industrial sector where you asked the question. Just one kind of clarification. If we think about China, we\\'ve heard from a number of companies within the Chinese area where things seemed to have slowed. I know you had the New Year issue, but how are you thinking about just kind of the overall business in China, and I guess in particular, a little bit more on the EM side since there\\'s a little bit more exposure there? Yeah, I think the best one overall, I mean, I think it\\'s well documented that the electronics side in China has got pressure on it. And the good news is, is that our analytical business both in Chemical and Life Science continues. But I\\'ll have each of the 3 group presidents give a comment of what their outlook -- what they\\'re seeing in China specifically. Guy? Well as you know, China has been very strong for us for the past years. And we see China very related to the comms\\' overall activities, both on the base station and handset. So we will see a slowdown in China compared to what we have seen in the past years. Yes, outside of the discussion earlier about the pause at the end of the quarter because there was nobody in the office for 2 weeks to take orders, the overall markets still remain very robust and strong in Chemical Analysis business from the food marketplace to chemical and energy, environmental and forensics, so very strong demand. And the comment that was made earlier from Guy in terms of the start to the quarter, we\\'re also seeing a very strong start in China as well this year, so -- in Q2. And I\\'m just going to echo Mike\\'s comment. I mean, no real change in trajectory. A lot of investment in Life Science, both the academic and therapeutic levels, and we did see the Chinese New Year effect, and we did see some strength in the last couple of weeks as those orders start coming back in. And then Bill, maybe just a broader question for you. If you think about that Electronic Measurement business, some peers of yours will -- even though they\\'re not seeing things slow at the moment, will look at macro indicators and PMIs, whoever, and will forecast the business just based on that because they know how cyclical or how tight it is to those markets. Is there any -- does it make more sense maybe for you to -- instead of just looking at the current momentum in the business, but maybe to look at some of those macro factors and use that in forecasting your outlook for that business? Well, we do. And it\\'s no secret that our correlation in the past to SIA, which we don\\'t like to talk about as much, and of course PMI, we know exactly what the correlations are in order to do that. But at the end of the day, it is -- we have thousands of sales people that are out there with customers and we know what the overall macro environment is, but there are just deals that are going down. And if we get there first and have a better solution, we can sometimes offset some of the macro trends. But we do exactly as you suggest. And obviously, when Guy goes to Ron with his overall proposal to grow, we know what that macro environment is. We have a very detailed analysis to understand where the competitors are, where the competitors are strong, where they\\'re weak. But at the end of the day, we have to assign orders quotas to thousands of people, and it is very, very bottoms-up detail of what we can do. This is Vijay in for Ross. Could you comment on the strengths seen in Pharma? What is driving that strength? What are you seeing in the HPLC? How sustainable, I guess, is this strength going forward? Yes, Vijay, a really good question. We continue to be on the same theme, which is we see a technology upgrade going on and we see an acceleration of the replacement cycle. We\\'re about halfway through that acceleration of replacement cycle that we\\'ve been seeing and talking about, and that\\'s a big driver. A big surprise in a good way to us was the strength we saw in European pharma. So not only the 18% overall macro, but Europe was very solid. And that speaks to me as being a technology upgrade. We\\'re seeing a lot of mass spec as well as LC going into European pharma. So we think that\\'s a biomolecule investment lends, one quarter of pretty solid results on top of a pretty good secular. Sure. And then maybe -- digging on an earlier question on -- in dividend policy, could you walk us through the rationale behind sort of initiating a dividend policy. What was the thought process? Well, the thought process was very, very straightforward. As you know, we have a substantial amount of cash. Most of that cash is trapped outside the United States. We are absolutely committed to being a high investment-grade company, so we\\'re not going to borrow against that money to return cash back to the shareholders, even though we have a long history of already buying back $8.5 billion worth of stock. Our number one priority continues to be in acquisitions, but we are a conservative company, and we will not make an acquisition that we can\\'t get back our cost of capital. So in this environment, what would it take to attract new investors? There is a growing segment of investors who are demanding to have some sort of dividend being paid for them to be able to invest in a company. 400 of the 500 S&P 500 companies today all pay a dividend. And so as you go through that rationale and environment that I believe will continue to have low interest rates by paying a dividend opens up the potential for investors to buy Agilent stock, and obviously reward the existing shareholders with a dividend and payback that is very measurable and not at the mercy of a buyback. That was very helpful. And maybe if I could squeeze one last one in and apologize if this has been asked. Did the Chinese New Year have any impact in the quarter either on orders or revenues? Yes, we -- well, sure it had. You can\\'t shut down, as Mike said, the last 2 weeks of China and not have an impact. That was in our forecast, right? We knew this. Every 4 years, this event happens in our Q1. The analysis we do just from the surface believes the impact was one point delta, right? But it\\'s hard to tell because behavior changes. If you\\'re going to shut down, why am I going to take the delivery if I don\\'t need it? Do I need the components or -- because we do the same thing in our own factories. And so it\\'s a very difficult event for us to fully quantify. Over the decades, Christmas, you know exactly what happens in the West at Christmas during the December time period. We know what happens on Chinese New Year. When they\\'re both together like that, it\\'s always interesting for us. But given the shift of our business into more countries that celebrate the Lunar New Year, we just have more -- a little bit more volatility when we have this event that shows up every 4 years. Just a question perhaps for Ron. When I look at the EMG piece of the business, and where drops -- we dropped the sales growth expectation from 4 to 2 for the full fiscal year. Is the majority of that or is all of that decline really calculated based on your current expectations for the communications business? As we basically have a very good quarter in general purpose and Mil/Aero, is the outlook for those 2 pieces of the business relatively unchanged? Well, I would just start by saying that one percentage point of the delta is currency related. So volume-wise, you\\'re talking about one percentage point reduction. Go ahead. Although we saw the aerospace defense business being strong, we have not expected it in our forecast to be as strong as it was in Q1, and the same thing with regard to the industrial market. So the other markets we\\'ve left relatively flat or relatively conservatively, and we\\'ve adjusted the communications market as we have spoken. So... I don\\'t think that that\\'s something that I have concrete data on, on the handsets. I know on the base station side, the component side, we\\'re very strong, and we have grown faster than the competitors in the last 2 years. But on the handset side, I think there\\'s a couple of good competitors that we\\'re fighting toe-to-toe with. And it\\'s going to continue that way for a while. Okay. And then just a last question. When I look at the volumes and the expectation for EMG\\'s sales growth for the balance of the year, it\\'s -- are there any significant puts and takes at the margin line? Or is the operating margin for EMG likely to settle in here plus or minus a point, I guess, with sales mix? We\\'re committed to the 30% to 40% incremental model that Agilent has. EMG has been at 40%. And even this quarter with the communications surprise, we delivered a 58% incremental. So we feel very comfortable that we\\'re running the business very efficiently and effectively given the macro situation that goes on. And I don\\'t anticipate any major changes from the path that we\\'re on to deliver to our model. Actually, maybe a follow up to that last one, very specific to fiscal Q2. When I play with my model a bit, if I take my EMG down to levels you described -- my EMG revenue growth down to levels that you described in your prepared remarks, it doesn\\'t -- it looks like you guys are actually building in an incremental that\\'s much lower than the norm. I know over the course of year you\\'re expecting to stay in the normalized range. But I guess what I\\'m getting at is if I take my EMG number down, if I don\\'t take my incremental down in that group, it\\'s -- I have a hard time getting to your EPS number for the quarter. Any chance you could provide your assumption for incremental in EMG for Q2? Yes, I\\'ll take that question, Doug. This is Didier. When Ron talked about committed to the operating model, the operating model does show that below sudden revenue growth, you do have decremental, not incremental. EMG did a fabulous job this quarter delivering stronger operating margins on very small top line increase and huge incrementals. I would consider that to be exceptional. In Q2, there is no doubt that as we envision the 2% revenue growth, the kind of incremental that our model delivers normally, you would have a decremental. We will have an incremental, but it\\'s going to be a very small incremental. And again, totally in line with the operating model. With 2% revenue growth, it\\'s a different story than the 4% to 10% that we had talked about. But -- so there will be a small incremental, but certainly not in the 30% to 40% range considering the -- only a 2% revenue increase. And this is -- I\\'ll add. And we had got a previous question, are we planning any cutbacks? We have quite a few product launches in Q2, particularly on the analytical side. And we have made a decision given the situation in communications and anomaly, how quickly will the -- or how long will the pause be. We\\'re going to continue and stay the course through Q2, get the products out moving forward. As you said, over the year we\\'ll look fine. But I think doing something dramatic in Q2 across the company, and particularly given how strong the analytical business is, wouldn\\'t be a prudent decision. Okay, now that\\'s very helpful. A higher-level guidance question. You\\'ve guided for stronger growth in the second half versus the first half. Is this predicated on improvement in the economy, or is this just largely a function of comparisons? There is no doubt that all the economies that we follow and track do anticipate a small improvement in the second half. If I recall the numbers last that I\\'ve seen on average, the expectation is that the worldwide GDP will grow about 3% for the first half, but more like 3.5% in the second half moving towards 4% in the first half of the following year. So there is a little bit of tailwind coming from the macroeconomic situation. We also have much easier compare. I mean, like all the talk we\\'ve had about communications, for example this quarter, last year, communications improved 45% year-over-year. So our compares vary in Q1. Our compares in Q1 and still Q2 are very challenging. They get much, much easier in the second half. So that\\'s also something to take into account. Okay. And if I could sneak in one more, another question on Lunar New Year. I know it\\'s always tricky for you guys to forecast when this happens when it falls in fiscal Q1. But would -- my guess is you can\\'t quantify the impact exactly, but could you at least say whether this was close to -- whether it came -- whether the impact was close to what you had planned for and how the more favorable comparison in fiscal Q2 comes into play? Yes. And again, like I said, I don\\'t want to use the Lunar New Year as an excuse whatsoever. We knew this was going to happen, we made our forecast and we\\'re off by effectively a point. And now that\\'s shame on us to able to make that happen moving forward. And as we said, it appears things are going back to normal in Q2. I mean, it\\'s our responsibility to forecast that. There -- it\\'s just difficult to know exactly what is going to happen, and then you couple that with well-documented event, particularly in the comms side that there could be a build up of excess component capacity. So how much of that is just purely adjustment of inventory, which has got to be most of it, how much was it just the behavior because you had a major holiday in January. And it\\'s -- quite honestly, it\\'s hard for us to know exactly what the answer is. But we obviously missed what the expectation was based on absolute demand in the component side of RF, as well as the infrastructure. Bill, could you talk about the market for LC/MS, where we are in the conversion rate to high pressure, the color in those markets? Sure, I\\'ll have Nick answer that question. But as you can tell, we continue to do very, very well in this market. Yes. And Paul, just for clarification before I answer, are you talking about LC, or you\\'re about LC/MS because you said LC/MS? Okay, both. Okay. So let\\'s start with LC. Yes, we are seeing tremendous demand for the UHPLC method. And therefore, we\\'re seeing more than 50% of the units going into the market being UHPLC capable. And that, by the way, is both an Agilent statement and a market statement. So while we still see a lot of people on the old methodology, they\\'re buying UHPLC-capable machines, we think this continues to be a really strong technology upgrade vector. It\\'s the comment I was making earlier about technology upgrade in pharma even in Europe going on. So a really strong market. That market is probably growing in the upper-single digits, and we\\'re doing a little bit better than market, so we\\'re pretty pleased with our stronger upper-single digit growth there. In the case of the mass spec market, tremendous technology waves going through not only to Life Science-specific customer sector, but also in the applied markets like food and environmental. And so we\\'re seeing a lot of strength. We had very, very solid double-digit growth in mass spec for the quarter in revenue and really nice momentum going forward. So that also is seeing a technology push at the triple quad and multi-sector end of that market, Q-TOF as well. Yes, sequencing is a great question. We\\'re in that market, not in a box. And right now that\\'s a good thing to be, is not in a box. We are in the reagents that go in front of the sequencers. We think there\\'s a lot of installed sequencing capacity at the gigabase large center world. We see a lot of installing of instrumentation going in the personal sequencer world, and both of those things are really positive for somebody who is in genome partitioning because we think the personal sequencer world is definitely going to be dominated by partitioned genome subsets and kits. And we\\'re seeing the gigabase world start to talk more about exome rather than whole genome. And you\\'ve heard the big box guys make comments just recently on how their new boxes are going do exomes fast. You\\'re starting to see actual data in their marketing speak or from the 2 big CEOs in this space about how they can do so many gigabases or so many exomes. So we\\'re pleased to see that, that terminology is getting into the market. The oscilloscopes play not only into the industrial market, but they also play into the computer market. So we don\\'t give those stats out on a quarterly basis as our competitors eagerly wait for our announcement, but we have a very solid product line in that area. And we\\'re very happy with the share gains that we\\'ve made. We\\'ve done a very good job, and we\\'ve gained share at the low-end and the high-end, if you look at the macro trends over multiple years. In any quarter or any period, someone could claim that they\\'ve done a little better or a little worse depending on what they shipped and what the flow through and what went into distribution. But our gains in oscilloscope market share have been second to none for all the product lines we have in the company. Well yes, I\\'ll take that one. So at constant currency, the Americas in terms of revenue, yes, grew 3%. CAG and LSG had phenomenal growth and EMG had a decline. Interestingly, just to complement also, order-wise, to be precise, EM had a 6% increase in orders for the Americas. So I mean it shows it is sometimes -- things are going to be a little bit lumpy. No, there were 2 areas that were particular. There were base station manufacturers in Europe that we saw some weakness and then obviously, the one in Asia. So primarily, the weakness that we saw in base stations was in Asia followed up by Europe. In fairness, the absolute correlation between where the order gets made and the revenue gets made and delivered, I would tend to look at these as macro trends from the region to deep down by region in the product line is highly problematic given how global procurement is done in this world today. I think the EM and the Life Science product cycle stuff is relatively picked over. So I did want to spend a moment on the diagnostics initiatives you mentioned in the prepared remarks. And specifically, what are some of the next steps that you guys are sort of working on for product development in that area? And then, maybe what kind of investments you need to make at the margin for channel development as you move forward this year? Good. I\\'d have Nick give an update. And again, we\\'re going to go in a lot more detail in our Analyst Meeting next month. But Nick, why don\\'t you kind of give an overview of where we are? Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Isaac. And as Bill said, we\\'ll try to give you a lot of detail on the 8th of March. But yes, basically I remember that this is still a small piece of Agilent where we\\'re just dipping our toe in the water here. We\\'ve registered factories, as you\\'ve heard a couple of quarters ago. We\\'ve now registered a couple of critical product lines with U.S. FDA. We\\'re continuing to produce a few things in the side of genetics area that we\\'re talking to the FDA about as well, and our reagent consumables side. Those will be micro arrays. We do not yet have a big push here. We do not yet have a big significant presence in regulatory or clinical trial management. And so those are elements that we\\'ll need to work through, and those are elements that are gaps not to mention, as you pointed out, how do we get to the customers and how do we educate the doctors, and those that where we\\'re off in reimbursement is something we\\'re also aware of. And as you know in the last 7 years, mostly organically, we have really built up our Life Science capability. That was task number one. During the course of that, we had brought in house the reagents capability, automation capability, the recent announcements that we made this quarter. And so we are putting all the pieces together. As you know, we\\'re inherently an organic growth company. Moving forward, we\\'re obviously going to look at ways to be able to accelerate Nick\\'s success through additional acquisitions. But I believe that our Life Science base is solid, and the diagnostics is the most -- next logical place to put our toe in. Sure. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. If I could just follow up with another thought there. If I put the comment you just made on the acquisition path in context with the dividend and all that, I think we can all agree that some of the diagnostics assets that we\\'ve seen trade in the last couple years have gone at pretty interesting premiums. So is it fair to say that if you guys find assets that you find interesting in diagnostics, you might be willing to take a longer horizon for your return hurdles that you might have also in the business? We will not make a bet that we don\\'t have high confidence that we can get a return in the lifetime of our shareholders. Yeah. So 2 sort of broad areas, I think I\\'m curious about. I think the first is just looking at Electronic Measurement business. And the source of weakness there, I think, one of the areas you highlighted was components in the wireless. So my understanding at the point at which you spun out your Semiconductor Product Group into Avago was that the vast majority of the components business, especially into handsets went out of that business, but you mentioned not just infrastructure components but also power amplifiers, just partly the things like that on your commentary today, I think, or during the Q&A. So can you give us some color as to what is the component percentage of that business right now and what the strategy is? And whether you are actually competing with Avago in that business, or you\\'re still focused on primarily the infrastructure side. So that\\'s the first sort of broad area of questioning. Yeah. Just first of all, we\\'re not making any comments about Avago. Avago does, in fact, supply RF components into the handset market moving forward. We\\'ve been very clear. We believe the handset test market is 25% of the total market. The other 75% is all related to the components that go into base stations and components that go into handsets. That\\'s what we\\'re talking about. The biggest impact is in the smaller components that go into handset. Obviously, when the infrastructure base station people cut back, that\\'s going to be impact to that component supply chain. But the component supply chain going into handset is dramatically bigger, and that is where we saw the impact. Yes, but we are seeing it only from the test side over there. It\\'s not components that you\\'re selling into the market.  we\\'re components business. That\\'s what I thought you were thinking. So we\\'re not competing with any of the guys in this thing. We\\'re not selling components. We are selling test equipments. I know, I got it. Yes, so that\\'s been a -- okay. So it\\'s purely from the supply chain correction over there impacting demand for your test equipment, but there\\'s nothing that you\\'re selling directly into the handset? Okay, got it. So I just wanted to clarify that to ensure that, that wasn\\'t something that I missed out on. The second area is just when you announced the acquisition of Varian and you talked about the delta between the gross margin -- traditional Varian products and the Agilent sort of similar products and where they could be, there\\'s about 1,000 basis points delta there. And you\\'d also identified opportunities for both your Life Science and Chemical Analysis business to shift production into Penang into your facility there, and get benefits from those businesses by doing that shift in production. Could you give us some color as to how much of that delta has been captured and how much more room is there over the next couple of years to improve those margins further and how much of the shift is still left in terms of production over there? All right. Of the $100 million of savings, $35 million is in corporate overhead, and we have completed that. And you can see it in the -- our expense structure. The other $65 million is all in manufacturing. One point -- we will get one point this year. It\\'s going to be back-end loaded. But we are going through and redesigning every one of these products. We\\'re going to do it right. And we\\'ve been very clear it\\'s going to take us at least 3 years to be able to get through this process. I have the highest confidence that we\\'re going to do it, but we\\'re going to do it right. I just wanted to maybe add some comments. We\\'re right on our internal plans in terms of the product transfers and the internal gross margins, but also this -- a comment around the refreshing of the portfolio which will drive not only improved gross margin, but also improved market share. We\\'ve just launched a number of very exciting new products and we just actually finished up a division review with Bill, and these products are exceeding our internal forecasts. So the portfolio strategy is coming together as well. That will be my teaser for the March Analyst Meeting where we\\'ll go in some detail. But we are right on our plans that we put together. And just one example that we had on the AA, we introduced the world\\'s first microwave AA that essentially will allow this instrument to be closer to some of the uses such as in mining, and not have to put it in an infrastructure to provide, for example, Argon gas. And here is an example where you spend money. Varian actually developed the work. They just didn\\'t have the money and the opportunity to do it. We finished that up. It\\'s been easy to tear their cost out, take their existing AA and just transferring it to Penang, but we\\'re not going to take market share over time. That\\'s our strategy. We\\'ve been very, very clear on that, and I have high confidence that we\\'re going to make it happen. Ron? I also want to comment that we\\'ve announced a new OF organization or order fulfillment organization that is focused on getting the absolute maximum leverage out of Agilent. And that includes for instrument products, the building of our products, the logistics and the supply chain. And that is something that\\'s brand new, and we\\'ll be updating folks on March 8 at the Analyst Meeting. So it\\'s fair to look at -- based on your commentary from the gross margins on the Electronic Measurement side that there is a potential for negative leverage as things go down, that the vast majority of sort of the efficiencies that when you gain by improving cost on the Electronic Measurement side are behind us, but for the Life Science and Chemical Analysis side, there is still very significant runway for margin expansion by reducing cost. Is that fair? So just a few quick ones just to clarify some things. First, following the comment that was just made about NMR, I think it\\'s an interesting question there as it relates to kind of the margin trajectory at BAM at least versus my model. It was actually surprisingly strong, and we think about CA and what\\'s going on at LS between the NMR investments, the Varian cost savings and the incremental targets. It\\'d be great if you could kind of walk through how you think about how the year progresses in light of the costs and I would say kind of below the COGS line? And I\\'ve got a follow up to that. Yes, there\\'s lots of parts to your question. So let me -- I think the easiest is just for me to give an example of what we\\'re going to do then turn over to Mike and Nick to be able to -- how we balance the portfolio. Nick\\'s example in NMR, Varian invented the technology, underinvested. The other guy\\'s done a very, very good job. We\\'re systematically going through and redesigning the console. It\\'s already transferred to Penang, redesign the probes, try to optimize the magnet manufacturing. These are all the things, and Nick\\'s -- in his past life was an expert in this space. And those are the type of things we\\'re going to do. And so we have that impact to his operating profit number, and it\\'s substantial. On the other hand, we know we can fix this. This is where the expertise of our Electronic Measurement Group comes in since it\\'s an RF measurement. And we will do that and spend the time to be able to make that through. So Nick\\'s getting an incremental, even though he\\'s making this investment in NMR based on the benefit of the growth he has in the other products. So that\\'s the example of things that we\\'re trying to work through and that is consistent with our operating model that we have displayed, and we\\'ll give an update next month. But again, we\\'re really quite pleased with the progress we\\'ve made in terms of driving the top line growth, as well as making these ongoing investments, as well as the impact of the acquisitions which again, it\\'s small numbers, but are non-trivial. So I\\'ll have Mike and Nick give some comments. Yes, Daniel, since that kind of gave the NMR an example, let me go ahead and give you one more layer of detail. I\\'ll let Mike do the subsequent comment. Just to think about this, to redesign a product, you also move the supply chain, and you redesign the new product to include a supply chain that\\'s based and leveraged. And it goes back to what we\\'re trying to do here, Ron talked about and we\\'ll talk about a lot more when we see you guys in March, centralizing order fulfillment centralizes our supply chain. I get the R&D team to design a new NMR probe or a new NMR magnet or a new NMR console and at the same time, we leverage the supply chain of a $7 billion company that\\'s heavily Asia based and rapidly Asia moving. That\\'s gets up front in the design. So all of these pieces interweave to really drive that gross margin element and the target is not to take the 10-point gap that was existent between Varian and Agilent and close that gap. The target is to take where Agilent will be in 2 years and drive Varian to that point, which will be better than where Agilent was by itself 2 years ago. Well -- and if I could just hop in for a sec, I guess that speaks to the kind of the real crux of the question, which is when we look at the incremental targets that you guys have provided by segment, it certainly seems like at least given what we saw in BAM in 2Q -- or excuse me, in fiscal first, the run rate actually looks, all things considered, like you guys are kind of above plan overall. And if -- it would be wonderful, Didier, if you could kind of speak to the overall run rates. When we look at R&D on a sequential basis versus 4Q, I mean, that number has basically stayed flat for a while now, and SG&A barely budged. So I guess when investors think about the flexibility that you\\'ve obviously demonstrated, right, with EMG having a very strong incremental in the quarter, how do these numbers directionally move through the rest of the year? Well, so -- and you can reconstruct that from the overall guidance I\\'ve provided. But yes, you will see as you do that, that BAM will have some really nice incrementals in the second half of the year. I mean, obviously, Didier, with the integrations behind us, we\\'re in pure execution mode, and lots of things are going on relative to supply chain transformation. As Nick talked about the portfolio transformation, and in few quarters, you\\'re going to continue to see -- if you look back, you\\'re going to see these reflected as it flows through the systems in terms of continued improvement to our gross margins, so pure execution mode. And I have -- and again to remind everyone, the call is at -- we have moved the company over the last 7 years to have a higher and higher percentage of variable cost, variable spending. And as we entered into 2012, we\\'ve raised the bar. Our goal is to have 21% of return on invested capital, now it\\'s 25%. We have set the pay for all the executives at a higher growth rate than what we just said. So that obviously builds into the system lower expenses as we go forward. And that\\'s factored in our guidance and factored into our confidence of why we believe that we can -- under the scenario that we gave, we can hit the mid-range of our EPS guidance. Yes. I mean it\\'s -- when -- to give a high-level view, and you can do reverse engineering of all the numbers I have given you. But on the midpoint of our revenue guidance, which is a 5.2% revenue growth, would generate for the company 36% incremental, which if you know our operating model, 36% corresponds to 8% revenue growth. So what is happening, a lot of the Varian cost synergies are starting showing up along with the benefits of the new organization. So this is a thing that adds fuel to the fire and explains why we are meeting the mid-range of our incremental guidance even on lower revenue. That really was kind of the heart of the question. It certainly does seem like the savings are showing up and investors can actually see the leverage that you guys have talked about. And if I could ask one last follow-up, I think -- obviously, given all the focus that we\\'ve spent this call talking about comms, the various end markets, it\\'s interesting because if we go back to quarter, we were all talking about the regional outlook and what was going on in Europe and how things were shaping up in the U.S. as it relates to academic and government. In this quarter, if my math is correct, it looks like Japan actually accelerated. Europe was a positive surprise, but the U.S. and China were a little bit weaker than expected. So how do investors think about the overall volatility given there is obviously kind of product and market noise, and then now it certainly looks like there\\'s a regional overlay that is hard to kind of reconcile when you build it all up? As I said, there is no lack of signal-to-noise ratio in this quarter. We have lots of good news, couple of surprises in there, different regional shift and again, I\\'m sure each of us on this call has a different opinion what\\'s going on. But this is the challenge that corporate America corporations around the world have and trying to navigate a pretty complex set of markets by region and submarkets that we have. And then, of course, the performance of the company itself. So again, it\\'s -- I don\\'t envy the investors in trying to sort out exactly what\\'s going on. Yes, I think everybody has to go, so we probably need to close this off for now. So, Keith, I\\'m going to go ahead and just close and thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please of course give us a call and thanks again. Bye-bye. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\\'s conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Caris, and I will be your coordinator for today.    As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to hand the call over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s Third Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2012. With me are Agilent\\'s President and CEO, Bill Sullivan, as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian, and the presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis Groups, Guy Sene, Nick Roelofs and Mike McMullen. Also joining is Lars Holmkvist, President and CEO of Dako. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor. agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results, where you will find revenue breakouts, historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations and an investor presentation. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. For any non-GAAP financial measures, you\\'ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia and hello, everyone. Agilent\\'s Q3 orders were down 1% and Q3 revenues were up 2% over last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 per share and operating margin was 20.3%. Agilent\\'s performance in the fiscal third quarter did not meet our revenue and EPS guidance. This was due to a softening of shippable orders, as well as a much higher-than-normal push-out to delivery from our customers at the end of the quarter. While we are not seeing outright order cancellations, we\\'re seeing all the classic signs of a slowdown. Deals are taking longer to close and customers are delaying shipments. We felt the full effect of this phenomenon in July, the last month of Agilent\\'s third fiscal quarter. The biggest headwind was in the aerospace and defense sector, where revenue was down 11% year-over-year. While U.S. government spending was stable, it was offset by decline in defense contract business. We would normally see an uptick at the end of the year, but we expect Q4 to be lower than normal due to fears of automatic spending cuts. The second headwind was in the industrial segment, which declined 10% amid deteriorating economic conditions. We saw more conservative demand from our customers in distribution channels across the industrial markets. A third headwind was in the environmental markets, which declined 6% amid lower government spending. Finally, Academic and Government research was down 6% while we saw continued softening due to budget concerns. The declines in these submarkets were offset by positive results in other areas. Communications revenues were up 7% over a year ago, reflecting strong wireless manufacturing test demand. Wireless manufacturing growth was driven by smartphone capacity expansion, primarily for devices but also for component manufacturers. Forensics Markets revenues were up 17%. Strength was driven by increased demand for screening and identification of abused prescription pharmaceuticals and designer drugs. Pharmaceutical and food safety markets also experienced modest growth. Finally, we saw strong growth in diagnostics, where our acquisition of Dako closed near the end of June. As part of Agilent, Dako\\'s currency adjusted revenue was up 14% over the same period a year ago, and business reported the strongest July in its history. The integration of Dako is proceeding well. Net result of this market, give-and-take, is that we ended up with 2% revenue growth for the third quarter. Even with Q3\\'s disappointing revenue, our teams continued to leverage the power of Agilent\\'s operating model. Agilent has a number of variable cost mechanisms that we are able to exercise doing economic cycles. In addition, we are continuing our ongoing process to reduce manufacturing costs throughout the enterprise. Agilent\\'s global fulfillment organization had several initiatives underway to consolidate manufacturing sites, streamline logistics and reduce manufacturing costs. We\\'ve been able to react very quickly to the economic uncertainties and we will continue to act conservatively moving forward. Looking ahead, we believe we\\'re entering a slow growth environment. As a result, we have lowered our Q4 guidance. We remain well positioned to react quickly to business opportunities anywhere in the world. We continue to introduce innovative technologies and solutions, supplemented by bolt-on acquisitions. For example, earlier this month, we introduced an integrated 1 box tester and multi-port adopter. This reduces the number of tests for smartphones and tablets that contain multi-format and multi-band technologies. We also finalized our acquisition of Test System division of AT4 wireless. This acquisition expands our offerings in wireless R&D, particularly in LTE. We recently introduced the 1290 Infinity quaternary LC system, the first ultra high-performance quaternary system that delivers the accuracy and precision of binary systems. And our other recent introduction, product introductions including the microwave plasma, ICP, Triple Quad and GC/Q-TOF are exceeding expectations. Our SureFISH Pro has also continued to do well. We have dramatically increased the number of customers evaluating this new technology. In addition, we have released our first translocation FISH probe that addresses the cancer market. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As always, my comments will refer to non-GAAP figures. Since last quarter\\'s conference call, worldwide GDP growth has slowed significantly to 3.1%, and the purchasing manager\\'s new order index has dropped to a 39-month low of 47.2, indicating a significant contraction in the worldwide manufacturing sector. In this context, our orders and revenues were below expectations, but we executed as per our operating model and delivered an operating margin of 20.3%, slightly higher than in the same quarter last year. I\\'ll now cover Q3 orders. At $1.66 billion, orders declined 1% from 1 year ago. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and currency, orders were down 2%. By segment, the 2% core order decline is the following: EMG, minus 3%; CAG, minus 4%; LSG, plus 1%; and DGG, plus 8%. The breakdown of the core order growth by region is Americas, plus 8%; Europe, minus 5%; Japan, minus 10%; and the rest of Asia Pacific, minus 6%. Moving to Q3 revenues. At $1.72 billion, revenues increased 2% from 1 year ago. Dako contributed $40 million to this quarter\\'s revenue. The core revenue growth, after adjusting for acquisitions and currency, was also 2%. By segment, the 2% core revenue growth is the following: EMG, flat; CAG, plus 3%; LSG, plus 5%; and DGG, minus 2%. Core revenue growth by region was 9% in the Americas, flat in Europe, minus 7% in Japan and minus 3% in the rest of Asia Pacific. Moving to the income statement and on cash flow. Cost control measures initiated last quarter, coupled with the automatic cuts from our significant variable cost structure and reduced variable pay related to the Dako acquisition, resulted in our achieving an operating margin of 20.3%. To put it in a different perspective, compared to the midpoint of our guidance, excluding Dako, revenues were lower by $97 million, while operating profit was down only $26 million. In a tough macroeconomic environment, we\\'ve delivered strong financial performance and continued to demonstrate the power of our operating model. Non-GAAP net income of $278 million or $0.79 per share compares to $276 million and $0.77 per share 1 year ago. Total cash generated from operation was $240 million, down $12 million compared to the same period last year, when we received $31 million from the unwinding of an interest rate swap. Now turning to the guidance for Q4. As always, our guidance assumes exchange rate as of the last day of the reported quarter. We are projecting a Q4 revenue range of $1.76 billion to $1.78 billion. At the midpoint of $1.77 billion, our guidance corresponds to a flat core growth for the quarter and for the full year, to a core growth of close to 3%. Our Q4 EPS guidance is $0.80 to $0.82. At the midpoint of the guidance, full year EPS would reach $3.07, a 4% increase over last year. I was wondering if you could make some comments on this Pharma end market, and I\\'d be particularly curious about NMR demand there. Sure. Pharma end market. Pharma continues to be a decent market for us. We see mid single-digit growth in terms of the orders and revenue in that marketplace. NMR and Pharma is a place that has been somewhat soft. Basically, they\\'re relocating a lot of facilities. And so, they have yet to buy large capital equipment in the chemical molecule space. And NMR tends to be more traditionally a chemical screening tool, so it\\'s relatively flat and flatter than the overall market. Great. And then just a follow-up. Are there any updates to the outlook for the Dako synergies in 2013, revenue synergies in particular? So for our forecast for Q4, Dako\\'s revenue is forecasted to be at $85 million. They\\'re coming off a very strong Q3, and we have not given a forecast for FY \\'13 yet, but we will do that in Q4 earnings. But Lars, maybe you could share on some of your views for the quarter and how the integration is going. Yes. Certainly, Bill. I think they\\'re making progress. I mean, a couple of factors that I\\'d like to point out. Number one, the advanced staining market remains strong, funding remains in place. We see robust volume and value growth across our regions. And secondly, and more importantly, Dako is making good progress. So we see sequentially, our business growing and coming up from a fairly low growth rate prior year. This is not a straight line commitment to say that we\\'re going to continue every quarter to deliver this growth rate. There will be some fluctuations as we move forward, but certainly Dako is making significant progress in our base business improvement program. Our investment into the Americas market, as well as the Asia Pacific emerging territories is bearing fruit and we see a very significant uptick of our business. New technologies are also picking up and taking good traction right now. Okay, so we can assume the synergy targets that were laid out when the deal was announced are still essentially in place. Well, I referred to Bill\\'s comments. Basically, what Bill said for the fourth quarter is in place and we\\'re going to come back with the specific revenues in this portfolio for \\'13. So I guess just big picture, Bill, maybe you can just -- maybe you can just talk about kind of how the quarter progressed, a little bit more detail. And maybe, as you sit here today, what continues to make you feel a little bit more uncomfortable within your business versus where are you feeling a little bit better? Well, the big surprise at the end of July was our inability to ship $50 million of revenue due to customers\\' unwillingness for delivery acceptance. And if we have shipped that $50 million, we would have beaten our guidance with Dako. And so, obviously, that was disappointing. It\\'s very classical in a slowdown that people will begin to push out deliveries. As I said in my prepared remarks, there have been -- there has been no evidence of cancellations during the quarter, but that\\'s the reality of it. So for our guidance in Q4, we assume the same order and revenue pattern from Q3 going into Q4. I think it\\'s prudent. We\\'re not assuming that this $50 million of revenue that was pushed out is somehow going to show up in Q4. And so we are taking a conservative position in terms of our revenue expectation, hopefully. Again, that there will not be continued deterioration for Q3. We are not planning for our seasonally high Q4 growth rate, so we\\'ll assume a flat Q3 in our core business, as Didier said. And then, we, of course, will get the benefit of the Dako acquisition in Q4 and that\\'s how we determined our EPS range. And with that $50 million, was it more weighted towards -- I know you talked about weakness in aerospace and industrial and chemical, but was it more weighted towards one particular either industry or segment? The delivery delays were very consistent to where we saw the slowdown of business. And again, the slowdown we\\'re seeing and I think, has been well documented in the newspapers and whatnot in terms of issues with prime contractors in the U.S. in particular and some issues inside the industrial segment. The environmental, which is still a large part of our business, again, is very much dependent on local government funding. And obviously, a lot of jurisdictions are in -- particularly in Europe and the U.S., under enormous spending pressures. Okay. And if I can, just 2 other quick ones. One just on Dako, just so I\\'m clear, that plus 17%, was that just July or was that a quarterly growth rate year-over-year? It was from the time we acquired Dako, so towards the end of June, a little bit over 1 month. And Dako, was that -- has Dako introduced any new products, I kind of -- what was -- those kind of new, more automated products have yet to be introduced, is that right? So Lars, why don\\'t you talk a little bit about why the quarter, I think, in total was a record, I mean, in terms of absolute terms in July, as well as very strong organic growth? And maybe you could describe some of the drivers. Sure. I mean, again, as I said, the market remains strong. We can see the reports from the industry and that confirms that the funding is in place and I think fundamentally, Dako is making good progress, and I refer to the base business improvement program that includes us upgrading our instrumentation base and us adding more sales people in front of the customers. We are yet to see the impact of a new automated stainer. And as I referred to that in the earlier call, we are hard at work at that. We are a couple of months away from market release, and we expect to see that hitting the market during 2013. And obviously, that\\'s going to be the incremental impact of the way they\\'re going to position that stainer. But fundamentally, the market remains strong and Dako is making good progress here, and this is across the regions that we see. Okay, that\\'s helpful. Then last one, though conceptually here just kind of following along on the Dako. I\\'ve got lot of questions, given the weaker environment in your -- the more flexible cost structure that you have, as your ROIC declines and you have less of a variable payout. Can you maybe conceptually just talk about how that plays out, say in an environment in which you\\'re planning on the ROIC hit because of Dako but then, let\\'s say, the environment is just a lot worse than you anticipate as well. Can you maybe just talk about how that -- how does that flexibility play out in that environment? So we have targeted, in terms of variable pay, 10% variable pay based on the overall salaries. And so that\\'s the base. And I think, roughly our total salary is about $1.3 billion. And so at the beginning of the year, we had moved the target at the 10% from a 21% return on invested capital to 25%. And so depending on the Dako obviously lowered for a short period of time, the overall return on invested capital, but any performance less than target, it automatically adjusts the Agilent variable pay. And we calculate that in terms of payout, the Q3 plus the Q4. And so roughly in Q3, our return on invested capital in total was at 18%. So  I mean, it\\'s a pretty linear extrapolation from a 25% target at 10% variable pay. It slides down very linearly along that vector. So it\\'s pretty easy to determine what an 18% return on invested capital would end up as a variable pay component. Does that make sense? Bill, so you guys have done a pretty good job, I think, over delivering on the core operating model, I guess up until the fourth quarter here. Obviously, with the revenue below. How -- at what point do we start taking structural cost actions, kind of in preparation or assuming this environment on the core revenue side continues? Well, I think, again, what we\\'re forecasting is, and I\\'ve been very clear on this, is kind of a muddle go-forward business environment. And if in fact that we are able to growth flat core plus the benefit of Dako, we are going to maintain a 20% operating profit without any major restructuring, and that\\'s our first order goal. Ron and the team have taken a lot of action to ensure that we can maintain our margins moving forward. We\\'re not anticipating another 2009. And again, there\\'s obviously issues with the euro still hanging out there. But right now, we\\'re forecasting a flat growth environment, and we believe that we can maintain our 20% operating margin with the existing head count. And again, I mean the one caveat is that Ron and the team and again, are working to drive out manufacturing costs. We are looking at site consolidations. So there will, in fact, be some impact in terms of streamlining our order fulfillment. But again, it\\'s not a major restructuring of the company. Got it. So Didier, are you willing to give the operating profit of Dako in the fourth quarter? And also, I don\\'t know if I missed this, but can you give kind of the core growth assumptions by division for the fourth quarter? That will be great as well. Basically, what we\\'re expecting is that a slight year-over-year deterioration in the core growth for EMG between Q3 and Q4, and also for the CAG in about the same core growth for LSG. And DGG, Bill already said that we are assuming $85 million of revenue for Dako. The overall operating profit on Dako is around the 15% operating profit. This is after restating from ISFR to GAAP. Of course, where R&D can be capitalized in ISFR also includes the investment that we are putting into Dako to beef up R&D and to be able to expand into Asia moving forward. But what\\'s interesting here is that the slowdown is in segments across all of the business. We\\'re not seeing what we saw in 2009 where the electronic business crashed. We\\'re seeing softness in academic and research, environmental, aerospace and defense and industrial. So as a result of it, as Didier said, it\\'s a lot of give and takes that end up with roughly a low core growth rate. Okay. So just to make sure, Didier, Electronic Measurement you said, so slightly worse than flat. Did I understand that correctly in the fourth quarter? Yes, exactly. I mean, overall, for Agilent, we are going from a 2% core growth in Q3 to flat in Q4. And so you see about the same kind of -- it\\'s homeostatic for by business or with EMG and CAG a little bit under the average and LSG a little bit better than the average. Bill, it sounds like Asia was exceptionally weak in the quarter and it seems like there was a falling off a cliff towards the end of the quarter. Could you talk about the country-by-country trend? Maybe give us a little bit of color around the China environment? Is this something you expect to be persistent? Is there a reset in your expectations? I know in the past, Didier has been relatively confident around the base trends there. Is there any change on that front? Didier noted the Japan being down 10% and again, I\\'ll have Didier explain exactly how we demonstrate orders versus revenue. But in ship to country, China\\'s business was up 23% year-over-year. This was all driven by the wireless business in EMG. Chemical Analysis and Life Science business were in mid single-digit growth rates. And Didier, why don\\'t you again, explain in terms of how we know regional revenue versus how the orders are necessarily placed? So we -- in all the reports that we provide and all the regional information that we provide, orders and revenues are consistently computed on the basis of where the order is taken. So if an order is taken in the U.S., it impacts both the U.S. -- the regional, the Americas order growth rate and the Americas revenue growth rate. The number that Bill gave you by country, we are able to track on a ship-to basis. So there might be an inconsistency between -- there is, obviously, between the number that Bill gave you, 22% growth or 23% in China on a ship-to basis, and the Asian overall, Asia-Pacific excluding Japan growth rates. But just because we want to report orders and revenues the same way by -- based on where the order is taken. Sorry for the -- it might add a little bit of complexity but it provides a little bit more information to do it those 2 ways. Okay. I guess, if you\\'ll fundamentally the view the demand environment in China, Bill, how would you sort of look at that outside of the dynamics of that order there disregarded et cetera but what does the fundamental situation there are look like? Is it sequentially worse? Did you do see a similar sort of falling off in July? And what\\'s the view going forward? We\\'ve seen some other competitors have commented on China being weaker than expected, and the recovery likely pushed out into \\'13. So could you give that sort of fundamental color from an Agilent standpoint? Yes. Overall, China is slowing, showed up in our numbers. The big swing factor in China will be wireless manufacturing because 85% of the cell phones in the world are manufactured in China. The rest of our businesses is in the mid single-digit growth rate, which is half of what it was a year ago. It\\'s not going negative, but there is no doubt that China is slowing down as a result of issues particularly in Europe and what we\\'re starting to see in the United States. Okay. And I also wanted to ask you about the investment, the thought process behind investments in the business. In the past, you\\'ve talked about academic and government, just the whole end market being a higher growth potential market for Agilent. And therefore, the investments were higher and we were to expect lower incrementals in the near term. Given all of the challenges we have seen with funding and a slowdown there, has your view changed on sort of the return on investments in that space? And is that a part of the cost savings that you\\'re talking about? Or are the cost savings basically focused on EMG again? Again, the cost savings that we are targeting are in manufacturing. They\\'re not in EMG. EMG has the best gross margins in the company. The focus continues to be on chemical analysis and life science; predominantly, the Varian product lines. And that is what we are focusing on. I\\'ve been very clear. We need to get 5 points of gross margins improvement, and both Mike and Nick through Soon Chai\\'s organization are working on to be able to make that happen. At this point in time, we are not changing our investment portfolio. A company cannot instantaneously jerk a company around for a momentary slowdown. If in fact there\\'s a financial crisis in Europe next year, then we\\'ll deal with that. But we are absolutely committed to continue to invest in research and development, committed to academic and research, committed to ensure that Dako is successful, continue our investment in life science, and of course, be competitive across all the applied markets and electronic markets. Again, we\\'re a company that\\'s been around since 1939, and we will continue to provide our customers the best measurement solutions in the world. So I\\'m trying to get a sense, piggybacking off of what some of the other folks asked. Just on sort of where do you think we are kind of in the contraction and demand? I mean, when we look at sort of the macro, I mean, we\\'ve been seeing PMIs come in for a while. You\\'ve seen guys across the tech space on the customer side sort of have inventory issues and go through a lot of the demand pain and a lot of the high end CapEx guides leveraged Asia, it\\'s been pretty bad. Q3 is -- but we\\'re seeing the market and others sort of imply that we\\'re going to see sort of another side of it. That we\\'ve kind of come down, we followed this path the last few summers and then things sort of get better in the fall, winter. Now I guess I\\'m just trying to get in the context of what\\'s implied in Q4 and vis-à-vis, the reaction you saw from the customers, how you sort of characterize this versus other examples, whether it\\'s regionally or by division and just get a sense for, \"all right, so this is bad but we knew the economies were slowing.\" And so was it that much worse than you would have expected given all the data we saw? And what are we looking for to sort of see the other side of this if we actually could see an improvement in growth at some point? Clearly, that\\'s what the market in and of itself is sort of implying. Well, first of all, the big surprise is that we had a delta change of $50 million of revenue delivery that customers didn\\'t want. Now having been in the industry for a long, long time, this doesn\\'t surprise me whatsoever that when people get nervous about the macroeconomic environment, they slow down spending. 70% of the company is in capital equipment. It\\'s the easiest thing to stop and so that\\'s exactly what happened in the markets that we had outlined. In my opinion, the fundamental issue is that you have economic and political uncertainty in Europe and in the U.S. That\\'s why this is so different in what we\\'ve seen in the past. It\\'s not supply and demand, it\\'s not a normal rescission. But given the issues of the euro and what\\'s going to happen and then you have this financial cliff in the U.S. in January, complete political disagreement in Washington, people are really nervous. And I think that depending on, quite honestly, if you would -- if somebody agreed tomorrow to say that Europe is going to do a euro bond and the U.S. was not going to have a financial cliff in January, you would have a different outlook. I think it\\'s as simple as that. And of course, China, where their number 1 trading partner is Europe, is just going to see the second order effect of what\\'s going on in Europe and the U.S. And I think it\\'s that, and that\\'s why it\\'s so hard to predict what\\'s going to happen. Didier? I would just add that the slowdown, even though it was expected, everybody expected the Q3, Q4 -- Q2, Q3 GDP worldwide to be lower than in Q1, it was more pronounced. I mean when we guided in May, the PMI new order index was at its highest for some -- for awhile, and then it dropped to being the lowest since 2009. So it was fairly sudden because of the factors that Bill has mentioned. And it\\'s not something that even though we are conservative and we are careful -- and on top of that, to date, people say, \"well, worldwide GDP is going to be 3.1% growth for Q2, Q3.\" From our standpoint, when you look at our models and our correlations to GDP, it feels a lot more than 2.5% and 3.1%. So I\\'m not even sure that the numbers that people are expecting will really, really materialize. I think they are probably going to be revised down in the next few weeks. So I guess, do you think to some degree on a relative basis in your peers, in terms of how the performance just aesthetically looks, obviously you have an exposure to a couple areas that they don\\'t, like on aerospace, defense, which was weaker. But on the sort of traditional tools businesses, do you think the function of the timing of the quarter in that July was net worse and we\\'ll see this sort of play out in 3Q more broadly from a demand perspective? Or were there other things sort of specific to some of the product lines or some of the end markets where you touched that you saw sort of an exaggerated -- sort of delta versus expect relative to everyone else. I think you outlined the 2 issues. First of all, we had the extra month. So if you believe the macroeconomic environment is slowing greater than in July versus June, then that would impact us differently than our peers who are typically on a calendar quarter. And secondly is that if you do a weighted average growth of our peers, we grew slightly less than them. But we have much higher exposure to aerospace and defense and industrial. A lot of them have much greater exposure to academic and research, but the industrial and aerospace and defense is 18% of the company. So the areas where we\\'ve had strong market positions clearly, we saw the most headwinds in Q3. Okay. And I guess just last point, I just want to get this clear on Dako because I feel like there\\'s a lot of a bit of cross nets  here. In terms of how you\\'re thinking about sort of the revenue opportunity there from the synergies perspective versus the original, are we sort of in the same place? Or are we moderately worse? I guess, it isn\\'t clear to me kind of in terms of how you\\'re thinking about the total return equation there, kind of what the all in sort of conclusion is, having owned this now for a couple months. Well, we\\'re not going to overplay. We\\'re off to a great start. July was the best month in Dako\\'s history. And as Lars said, there are going to be ups and downs. The data and the forecast is that we are at or above what we told everyone to justify the acquisition. On the other hand, we are only at the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do. And the good news is it wasn\\'t bad news, which often happens in an acquisition, but we won\\'t be bragging about it until we get a couple years into leveraging the capability of Dako and Agilent together. That\\'s really where the proof in the pudding is going to be, to be able to get the return on the investments we had made. But we\\'re off to a very, very good start. I appreciate some of the color you\\'ve given on guidance. As we think about cash flow, though, can you, Didier, maybe update us on how you think about cash flow guidance for the remainder of the year? Do you still think you can do north of $1 billion for the year? Yes. No chance, $1.1 billion is our operating cash flow minus about $200 million of CapEx, so $900 million net. Okay. And then, Bill, relative to your own expectations for the quarter, can you help us think about how much of the delta was Europe versus Asia relative to your own internal expectations? It was mostly market segment just as we had defined. Again, we tend to look at business by company and by market, because most of the companies are so multi international. And then as Didier said, we sort of add it up at the end about what region got what orders and what revenue. But again, the surprise was the slowdown in orders and the unwillingness of customers to take delivery. I mean, that was the issue. And again, you add in $50 million back into our revenue number, we wouldn\\'t be having this conversation. And it all showed up at the end of July. And again, as any capital equipment company, all the shipments tend to be biased to the last month of the quarter and we could not get customer acceptance. Okay. And then as we think about kind of the diagnostics in genomics business, I think Dako was more or less in line with our estimates overall, because that division was a little bit late light relative to what we were expecting. Did you see a slowdown in genomics? And can you kind of comment on some of the underlying trends there? Yes. The quarter for the genomics was slightly below expectation in Q3. However, they\\'re going to be able to make that up in Q4. So again, I think we\\'re going to be in fine shape. It\\'s just the seasonality of the quarter on how deliveries are being done there. Obviously, they\\'re impacted the most by academic and research. They had some negative. The continue -- there\\'s a fair amount of pressure on the gene partitioning. It had a sequencing. On the flip side of it is, as I said, the acceptance of our new probe technology has been great. I mean, the number of customers has increased dramatically moving forward. We\\'re introducing this technology through the Dako sales team, and so we\\'re really quite reasonably optimistic as we move into Q4 in terms of our new growth -- our new group diagnostics and genomics group. We\\'re quite optimistic. And lastly, can you talk on price? Are you able to kind of hold price in this environment with some of the delays? Or do you have to see some slippage across the board on price? In this environment, there is a lot of pricing pressure across every one of our segments moving forward. And that\\'s why, as we had outlined, we are very aggressive on moving after manufacturing. We\\'re not signing it up. It\\'s following all the bottom line, because quite frankly, a lot of that work that Ron\\'s team is focusing on is going to offset some of the pricing pressure that we\\'re seeing. Bill, I guess we\\'re really trying to sort out what the earnings will be like this time around versus \\'08, \\'09 and the start of that. Within this pie chart showing industrial computers and semis is 20% of Agilent in the quarter, is most of that now industrial? And how do you think that industrial market will be this time around? Like what was it like in \\'09? Will industrial have a lower trough compared to your semiconductor computer that you saw in \\'09? Yes. The difference between today and \\'09, I mean, are not the same. Because in \\'09, there was lack of liquidity, there was lack of cash and people just stopped spending capital equipment. Right now, people are starting to be conservative because, first of all, 2009 is very real in their memory. And two, all you have to do is read the newspaper every day, and the lack of progress in Europe, the lack of progress in Washington causes people to not want to spend. If you look at the consumer savings rate, it\\'s gone up 1 point in the United States already. So if there is a euro crash of some sort, you will see, in my opinion, a replay of 2009. Right now, there is no evidence of a replay of 2009 at all. It\\'s a very hard one to call because I think people are just waiting to see what happens because of the lack of clear government policy. And I guess that gets to the cyclicality issue. Again, is it more industrial that you see in that sector? Or is it also the computer semiconductors? I wanted to understand the lab environment a little bit better and how the labs are thinking about the consumables that you\\'re selling to them versus the capital equipment. Can you talk a little bit about the product lines that were hit the biggest and how consumables played out in the quarter? So first, I mean, for my comment, then I\\'ll turn this over to Mike for his consumables comment, but for my comment, the LC business was pretty soft. We had a situation in LC where the overall growth in revenue was negative although the orders were positive, but that business was pretty soft quarter-over-quarter. Mass spec continues to be positive both on orders and revenue. So it is more that routine replacement subset that we\\'re seeing some softness in. And the rest of the businesses where it\\'s a technology upgrade, we\\'re still seeing strength. And that\\'s true, obviously more for pharma than academic. The academic problem was pretty regional. It was very much U.S. and Europe, not rest of world. And, Mike, if you want to talk about the consumable piece. Yes, sure, Nick. And just to continue the similar dialogue here. As Nick pointed out, on the LC side, replacement cycle, we saw a similar phenomena on the Gas Chromatography side in terms of replacement. But as we pointed out, some of the new higher end products are really continuing to grow quite well. Relative to consumables, we\\'re still seeing interest in the ongoing operations of funding those by our customers and saw growth in our consumables business in line with our peers. And as a follow-up, when you talk about China LSG and CAG growing mid single digits, do you think that mid single digit gets worse going forward? How do you think that plays out in Life Sciences for China going forward? Yes,. I think the market in China for life science continues to be a market that\\'s going to grow above their GDP rate, and that\\'s because it\\'s a place that they\\'re investing in their 5-year plan, so I think the market macro looks pretty decent. And you just have to look at their GDP and add a bit. We obviously are seeing a lot of competitors and we\\'re big in China, so we\\'re adjusting our footprint and our behavior to make sure that we stay at or above the market rate, and that\\'s a challenge for us. But the market itself looks pretty good. So just to tease out that last piece, is it completion that had the bigger impact this quarter? Or is it macro? Which 1 of the 2 for China life sciences? Relative to the CAG side, as Bill pointed out in his comments, we had solid single digit revenue growth for the quarter. And we would not expect to see a slowing from that growth rate as we move forward. What we did see in the quarter was really some level of uncertainty in the customer base, obviously, from some of the economic concerns that we\\'ve been talking about today. But also, in the run up to the leadership changes that we\\'ll be trying later this year. And our competitive position in terms of share remains very solid. A couple questions on the EMG piece of the business. The Communications piece is up 7%. Did we see any broadening of the strength there outside of the handset test business? Or was all of the strength kind of concentrated there? Have we see anything come back on the base station side or... So to answer this, we did not see changes on the base station in infrastructure compared to what we said last quarter, so this is staying at the low side. We have seen strength of our costs to overall wireless manufacturing segment and also the R&D part of the wireless handset. But you also saw, Guy, negative growth on the optical test side, which was quite substantial. That was really the big news buried in the numbers, is a very substantial cutback in optical test. Okay. And then just one maybe longer-term question, but there\\'s been an announcement, big service provider here in the U.S. talking about kind of phasing out their legacy 2G network. This is out to the 2016, \\'17 timeframe. But I\\'m curious, does that suggest an accelerated spend then in LTE and -- or what would you expect to be the impact on phasing out the legacy 2G spend but then accelerating impact on the LTE? Is that generally speaking a positive for sales and margins acceleration or... I don\\'t know if Guy of Ron have a different opinion. My view on this, and we went through the whole change from analog to G2, G3, G4, that the market doesn\\'t move that fast. And so at least based on the last 10 years data, one wouldn\\'t see an abnormal change in overall investment. But, Guy, Ron? Yes. I would really concur with what you said, Bill, is that the CapEx that we\\'re going to invest is not really changing. It\\'s just shifting, okay? Shifting. It is more -- I would say the positive is at the R&D side, because obviously, more investment going into additional LTE investment in designing. And potentially for LTE-Advanced, so there\\'s more and more need for what they call carrier aggregation to make the most of the network and the bandwidth they have, so that\\'s where I would see the positive signs. Again an EMG. So what are you seeing as far as comm orders going into 4Q? Did you see a hit there in 3Q? Or are you seeing kind of a steady-state continuation of the kind of mid high single-digit growth? Well, going forward, I would say there, the sequential, especially on the manufacturing side, we expect this to moderate slightly in Q4. As you know, there are cycles for some of this production and the time where some of these devices go to market. So that\\'s probably the comment I could do for Q4. Okay. It bounces along the bottom. And then can you comment on the -- you mentioned that there was weakness in the distribution channel. Do you have a view of sell-in versus sell-through, amount of de-stocking versus in demand there and where you think inventories are? Yes. We are very rigorous on managing our distribution inventory. And we track that very well. And so, there\\'s no evidence -- Ron, correct me if I\\'m wrong, of any build up in our distribution division channel. And, yes, we take credit when we ship to them in revenue, but we watch the sell-through very well just to ensure that we\\'re not exposed. I guess, first, for Didier, a question on gross margin. If we look at wireless manufacturing test tools kind of be at elevated levels as a portion of mix, and if we look at the $50 million in orders that haven\\'t really shipped in the quarter and then we take into account inventory being somewhat elevated, should we expect inventory to be worked through in the coming quarter? And consequently, expect some margin pressure perhaps with gross margin declining sequentially? No. You would expect we had a strong wireless manufacturing test business in Q3. And as you noted, it comes with a lower gross margin than the average. In Q4, you would expect a sequential increase in gross margin. And by the way, also a slight sequential increase in operating margin also. And I do believe there\\'s some opportunity to reduce inventory, but most of the inventory growth sequentially is the result of the inclusion of Dako. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And I guess, you discussed aerospace and defense being a little bit weak. You discussed that you\\'re seeing a little bit of, I guess, order softness you think because of the worry about a fiscal cliff. But as you guys sit here and you kind of do your roundtables and you look at the aerospace and defense business and you think about, I guess a range of expectations that could happen with sequestration, how do you look at that business playing out in 2013? I realize it could be a wide range but if you could kind of just give us a thought process of potential outcomes. I have been very public about this that one of the big risk factors to Agilent is aerospace and defense segment of the business, which at that time, is 10% of the company. Now it\\'s down to 8% of the company. We are coming off a record high investment over the last number of decades in aerospace and defense. With awards winding down, the desire to cut an additional $50 billion. The sequestering, as you said, is another $50 billion. If that happens, I believe that Agilent is going to be impacted. The only offsetting can be what type of programs are still funded. The issue is that once there\\'s that magnitude of a cut, everything just comes to a screeching halt until people decide what programs they are going to fund moving forward. Guy and the team, of course, are trying to get more business outside of the United States. We\\'re shipping into operational surveillance. We obviously continue to focus on radar systems and guidance. But if the financial cliff happens in January, I think that you\\'re going to see a major impact to U.S. defense spending. And as we said in our notes, the government spending hasn\\'t changed much, not too surprisingly. It\\'s the prime contractors that are already cutting back in anticipation of a major cut in defense spending. That\\'s what we saw and it happened faster than we had anticipated. And Bill, as you kind of look at the big picture, there any businesses outside of aerospace and defense, maybe getting into academia and government that you think could also see some of the negative impact of those potential outcomes? Every one of our segments that have high government spending are at risk of having pressure. Start with the local governments, no money, go to state level, state-by-state, go to countries, anything that we touch. And we saw it in this last quarter. aerospace and defense and environmental testing was below expectation. We know what the number is overall. I mean we\\'ve never provided that level of detail. But I think Mike and the team, and Guy\\'s team know exactly where the opportunities are in each -- by country, by region, province and by state. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And I guess just one more, maybe for Didier. As you kind of move into this sluggish macro environment and you kind of are in the process of digesting Dako, how should we think about your willingness to lever your balance sheet? Are we in kind of a cash replenishment cycle? Are you guys still actively looking for the right opportunity? Or do you think that your product portfolio is in essence where you need it to be at this point? Well, we\\'re always looking at opportunities for either bolt-on acquisitions or something. Or obviously, there\\'s no way we\\'re going to do anything in the short term considering we want to declare a victory on Dako before we become more aggressive, the same way as we\\'ve done with Varian. But certainly, the driver is not the availability of cash or how cheap interest rates would be if we do a bond offering. It\\'s just what opportunities are we seeing to create shareholder value. And right now, we are entirely focused on making sure we create the committed shareholder value in Dako. In the meantime, there could be small bolt-on acquisitions, but nothing big in the short term. First off would be on book-to-bill this quarter, can you maybe give us a sense of how that looks in the aggregate? And then also split it out between the EMG side and maybe the rest of the business? Yes. You have the information on our vital -- on all our documents. You have the order and revenue in all the schedules that we provided. This is the message. I mean this is again, at this point in time, the softness we saw was in EMG and in Chemical Analysis. Chemical Analysis related to government spending. Life Science actually did overall did reasonably well even with the pressure in academic and research. And obviously, Dako was a huge benefit to the company. But it is not a massive change in one segment versus the other at this point in time. Sure, okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, Nick, maybe, if I could ask a question about China to follow up on the earlier one regarding the government funding there. I think a lot of the other companies in the industry have been talking about waiting on a lot of the new government officials get into place, start releasing budgets. Some of that has been expected to show up in the back half of this calendar year. I\\'m just wondering if you could maybe comment on your expectations for those government dollars to start flowing at some point later this year. Yes, we think the comment is -- let me just say, I can pretty much validate the comment. They are putting a lot of new officials in place. There\\'s a question on government hand over. But in terms of when you get down into the bioanalytical sector and certainly Life Science, there\\'s a lot of money that is in principle committed and is yet to be committed by the actual end researcher at the National Academy. And we expect that to occur in the next few months. Great. And maybe a last question if I could on the long-term picture. Didier and Bill, can you maybe remind us what kind of a global GDP growth assumption you guys bake into your views? Because you guys obviously have your sort of foundation call for 8% core growth. I\\'m just wondering what kind of underlying GDP growth you think you need to hit that number on a multiyear base. Okay. And so just last there, is it fair to say if we look into a multiyear period where 4.5% looks difficult, would you guys maybe revisit the long-term guidance number? Absolutely. If we don\\'t believe in the 4.5%, absolutely. Right now, it is the consensus estimate. And I can tell you there\\'s a lot of debates in-house whether are economists smoking something or what are the downside risks. But right now, it is the consensus estimate. It\\'s the ISM number. It\\'s all the various bankers, economists are still going for this kind of ongoing secular growth rate for the worldwide GDP, with obviously emerging economies being growth engine. The message is, if in fact as predicted that the worldwide economy grows next year at 3.8%, we\\'re going to do fine. I mean Agilent has done a great job to be able to respond to market opportunities anywhere in the world. The big issue is nobody really knows what is going to happen. I would submit the fundamental issue is the issues in Europe and the United States. So the Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis gross margin -- not gross margin, operating margins improved nicely sequentially and -- which is impressive, certainly, in Chemical Analysis, given that the organic revenue growth is weaker. What happened quarter-to-quarter on that? Ron, why don\\'t you talk about some of the things that we\\'re doing from an order fulfillment standpoint to, again, meet our commitment to improve the gross margins by 5 percentage points? You may remember that back in November, we announced that we created an Agilent order fulfillment organization, and that\\'s to leverage $1.7 billion OF organization. They\\'re focusing on 3 particular areas. The first one is our overall manufacturing cost of actually putting together products and where products are made, and there\\'s some minor consolidations that are going on of locations for that piece. The second piece is to use one integrated supply chain, which can get the best sourcing possible. And that is located in Asia, where we had the EMG supply chain in the past. And the third is to lower our logistics costs. And all 3 of those areas are being used to leverage our capability across all of the businesses. And again, that is what\\'s driving the gross margin improvements in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis. As Bill had mentioned, there is some pricing pressure that shows up in the gross margin line less than it shows up in actual COGS dollars or a little bit more slowly, but the progress has been exceptional. So if you kind of look at a scenario where you\\'ve got sort of these improvement programs in place and the economy kind of muddles along for the foreseeable future, did I hear you correctly in that scenario that a flat year-over-year operating margin or an operating margins, say, in the 20% range is what you think is achievable? And then just one final throwaway question on this. On the CAG business, how did vacuum -- I would assume you got a bigger hit from the vacuum business, the old Varian vacuum businesses in there. Was that disproportionately down relative to some of the analytical and instrumentation businesses? In the current environment, I know Bill and Didier, you addressed this in a couple of points in the call, but I\\'m itching to get your take kind of overall. But how is management balancing making strategic investments versus being more aggressive on the variable cost side to protect earnings? Given, I think, the experience in \\'08 and \\'09, you certainly have taken a lot of fixed costs out. But just kind of looking ahead, like how hard are you pressing on that variable cost line today in order to kind of get to those fourth quarter numbers? This is the power of the operating margin or operating model that we have. I mean, a lot of the variable costs that you\\'ve already seen are automatically built into the system moving forward. Ron and the team of course are looking at all this discretionary spending, focusing the investment on where we can drive shorter-term opportunities. But in a muddle forward scenario of low growth, I have the highest confidence that we can continue to invest in technology that the market demands and not exercise the organization such a way that we\\'re distracting people from being the best company to do business with in our market segment. And so, again, we have a lot of flexibility. Obviously, the Dako inclusion and the continued growth in this is obviously very, very helpful for us in this environment. And barring a major economic reset, I think that within our framework, we can in fact deliver this 20% operating profit on essentially flat growth. And then kind of following up on the question earlier, but in terms of more near term, saying you\\'re looking at the fourth quarter, does your guidance imply, like can you give us some guideposts there? Just kind of broadly speaking, say PMI is the number that Didier focused on early on in the call, but is there something where -- is there kind of a range of estimates that you\\'ve looked at, that you feel comfortable with maybe on some of the macro indicators in terms of reaching your fourth quarter guidance? How we do it, it\\'s more mundane than that. We know what the backlog is, we know what the order pattern was in Q3. Historically, Q4, the orders are the highest for the year. In our guidance, we assume that was not going to happen, that we would see a replay of Q3 in Q4, so that\\'s the baseline revenue. So we know what the order turns are, we know the forecasts are, we know what the funnel is, but we took a position saying we have a backlog, we assume that the pushouts and deliveries weren\\'t going to show up in Q4, that, that phenomenon would continue. And that -- as a result of that, you\\'re seeing a flat organic growth rate from Q3 to Q4, then we get the benefit of Dako on top of that. That\\'s how we determined our guidance. Great. And then maybe one more. Just Asia x Japan, since -- sorry, Asia x China, sorry. But China certainly had some strong growth in the quarter, although the base decelerated, as you mentioned. But outside of China, can you just comment, were there any particular big countries that experienced more significant weakness are not? Just any color on kind of what you\\'re seeing there would be helpful. Japan minus 10%. And India, with all the currency fluctuations, we saw some purchasing folks that were delaying, trying to play the currency better. But other than that, it was relatively consistent. And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. And I would now like to hand the call back over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, Caris. And this concludes our call for today. I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. Thanks, again. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\\'s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Derek, and I\\'ll be your operator for today.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor relations. Please proceed. Thank you, Derek, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s Fourth Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2012. With me are Agilent\\'s CEO, Bill Sullivan, as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s President and Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian. Also joining are the presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Life Sciences, Chemical Analysis and Diagnostics and Genomics Groups, Guy Sene, Nick Roelofs, Mike McMullen and Lars Holmkvist. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there please click on the link for financial results, where you will find revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Bill and Didier\\'s comments today will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. For Agilent\\'s fiscal fourth quarter, orders were flat year-over-year, while Q4 revenues were up 2% over last year. Operating margin was almost 22%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86 per share. The headline for this quarter is that most of our end markets remain soft. As a result of executing on our operating model we improved gross margins, tightly controlled our expenses to deliver a record non-GAAP operating profit, exceeded our EPS guidance and strengthened our balance sheet as a result of excellent free cash flow. We are pleased with our financial results for the quarter, as we have rebounded from our Q3 earnings miss. In regards to end markets, Q4 played out as predicted. Fourth quarter revenue, excluding Dako, was flat compared to Q3. Electronic Measurement revenues declined 5% over last year. Communication markets were down in high-single digits with softness in R&D and manufacturing. Aerospace and defense spending was down 2% year-over-year. All of our Chemical Analysis markets remained soft except for Forensic, testing for drugs of abuse, with overall business revenues down 3% year-over-year. Our Life Science business was flat compared to previous year as we continue to see positive growth for Pharma and continued weakness in academic and research. Overall organic growth in our new Diagnostics and Genomics business was slightly up year-over-year. Dako met its fourth quarter revenue plan and continues to deliver on our expectations. Looking ahead for the fiscal -- full fiscal year 2013, Agilent expects revenue of $7 billion to $7.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.80 to $3.10 per share. Forecasting the outlook for FY \\'13 is difficult, especially in the face of a potential U.S. financial or fiscal cliff. However, we would like to share the thinking that supports our FY \\'13 guidance. First, we\\'re assuming there will be no new financial crisis in the United States or Europe. However, continued uncertainty will dampen demand until the second half of our fiscal year. Second, Agilent will face higher pension expenses and the traditional increases in compensation and benefits. These costs will be less easily absorbed in a slow growth environment. We continue to deliver on our ambitious manufacturing cost improvement plan. However, we\\'re also facing price competition again because of the current slow growth environment. Overall, we are forecasting an FY \\'13 core revenue growth rate in the range of plus or minus 1.5%. Total reported revenue growth, including the impact of acquisitions, is expected to be in the 2% to 5% range. In regards to business segments, we\\'re forecasting a 1% to 3% decline in our Electronic Measurement business. We are not counting on increased investments in cellular infrastructure in the first half. Our Chemical Analysis and Life Science businesses will be flat to up to 3% with no fundamental changes in end markets. For our Diagnostics and Genomics business, core growth to be in the range of 3% to 7%, with Dako growing around 3 -- 6%. Finally, we will continue our investments in R&D. We will ensure that we continue to meet customers\\' needs with innovative and cost-effective solutions to solve their most critical measurement challenges. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As Bill stated, we are quite pleased with our fourth quarter results. Revenues were in line with our guidance, and our operating margin reached a record high of 21.7%, a noteworthy performance in a challenging economic environment. We delivered substantial sequential and year-over-year improvements in gross margin, thanks to varying cost synergies and other cost-saving programs in CAG and LSG. We also maintained the strict operating expense controls implemented 6 months ago. Reflecting on our performance for the full year, we reached a record 20.2% operating margin on 2.5% core revenue growth. Our core revenue growth was close to the low end of the guidance we provided in November of last year, but our all-time high $3.12 EPS, including $0.04 from Dako standalone, was $0.12 above the low end of the guidance. We generated over $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, $100 million more than the guidance provided 1 year ago. Now turning to the guidance for fiscal year 2013. As Bill stated, our fiscal year \\'13 revenue guidance of $7 billion to $7.2 billion assumes the economy will muddle through in the first half of our fiscal year and pick up moderately in the second half. We do not assume a fiscal cliff scenario, but do expect stringent government spending. The $2.80 to $3.10 EPS guidance takes into account year-over-year increases in compensation and benefits of $100 million, as well as an increase in sales commissions of $15 million as quarters are being reset, offset by variable pay reduction, cost synergies and the incremental Dako standalone operating profit contribution of about $30 million. At the low end of the revenue guidance, one would also expect a tougher price environment. As you update your models for fiscal year \\'13, please consider the following. Annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2012. Stock-based compensation will be about $90 million compared to $76 million in fiscal year \\'12. And as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $32 million. Pension expenses will grow from $70 million in fiscal year \\'12 to $85 million in fiscal year \\'13. Depreciation is projected to be $195 million for the fiscal year. Net interest expense is forecasted at $95 million, and other income at $15 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is assumed to remain at 16% and the diluted share count at 355 million shares. And we expect operating cash flow of $1.25 billion and capital expenditures of $220 million. Now finally moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion and EPS of $0.65 to $0.67. As a reminder, we typically see EPS decline materially from Q4 to Q1 because of the impact of the December salary increase, front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to disbursement of the variable incentive pay of the previous semester. So, Bill, obviously we\\'ve got 4 more years here to look forward to of somewhat less accommodating tax policy. At what point does the board -- do you sit down and rip the Band-Aid off, so to speak, so you can put in place kind of a more formulaic capital deployment plan given your tax situation today? Well, I think that our fundamental tenets in terms of looking on capital deployment has not changed. Our #1 priority continues to be investing in the businesses as we have done. Secondly is to tax effectively, return excess cash to the shareholders. We\\'ve done that through stock repurchase, as well as paying for a dividend. And so I don\\'t believe that there\\'ll be any fundamental change whatsoever. And I don\\'t understand why one would deliberately not maximize your balance sheet to ensure the health and -- the health of the company going forward. Understood. So, Didier, why not put in more of a buyback or a capital deployment event to 2013? From what I understand, you\\'ve got some $500 million or so coming back tax efficiently. What have you assumed in terms of your marketing that U.S. cash for next year? Yes, I mean we intend to continue on the kind of programs that we\\'ve had since the last 3 years. As a reminder, in fiscal year \\'10, we bought back $411 million of shares, fiscal \\'11 $497 million, this year $172 million. We\\'ve maintained our basic share count of 346 million shares. We do have opportunities, potentially to bring -- to put some of the money we did bring back, by the way, on November 5 as permitted to good use in the U.S. through potentially acquisitions, small acquisitions. We spend about $200 million every year on small acquisitions, and we will continue to do regular buybacks as per above the average of what we have done in the last 3 years. So we will put the $500-plus million to Q3. In terms of the projected share count, I mean it\\'s always difficult. It\\'s so much influenced by the stock price, and I think it\\'s difficult to , so it\\'s just what to -- what we think, I mean it\\'s just a nice round number. And the board fully supports our fundamental position that we will remain investment grade. We will make prudent acquisitions to drive success for the company. We\\'ll do everything possible to tax effectively return excess cash to the shareholders. It appears that you are guiding us to model about 100 to 150-basis-point decline in the operating margin, is that right, Didier? And if so, is that all mix? And some of the other items that you called out on the call, are there areas of -- other areas that we should be thinking about where you are making investments this year? Yes, I mean, the -- we are -- in the range that we have provided, at the low end -- at the high end of the range, we are pretty much aligned with kind of gross margins -- I mean, this year\\'s results. But at the low end yes, indeed, that assumes that there will be a tougher pricing environment and a corresponding potential hit to the bottom line. Fundamentally, at essentially 0 organic growth rate being the middle of our range, we\\'re not going to get the leverage. We felt at this point in time, given the economic uncertainty, that to make any sort of restructuring charge to make up the difference is not prudent. Secondly, to back away from our investment in emerging markets, to back away from the investment we\\'re making in Dako, to back away from any investment we\\'re making in research and development is not the prudent thing to do. We are having very, very solid forecast in uncertain economic times and I believe that we not only need to be well positioned today, we need to make sure that we\\'re well positioned for the future. Okay. That\\'s all very helpful. And one follow-up. How did the expectations that you factored into 2013 guidance for Dako compare to those outlined at the time you closed the acquisition? Specifically, is the deal tracking below plan, ahead of plan? I think you had talked about moving towards market growth and for revenue of $0.33 in the -- or so or above $0.30 in the first full year of revenue. We\\'re about a quarter and a half into that. So just wondering what you factored into guidance. So the fundamental core business of Dako continues right on plan. We continue to make the investment in Asia. Those revenues are slightly behind plan. The investment in selling SureFISH through their product line is going well in terms of number of customers. We\\'re not quite yet getting a high enough reorder rate to hit the -- linearly on track to what we had said. We obviously have lots of time ahead of us. This is going to be a multi-year effort to be able to drive the value of Dako. But we are very, very pleased with the progress that we\\'ve made today, very pleased with the integration. And as I said, the core business of Dako continues to recover as originally outlined. Just wanted to ask you about -- Bill, you\\'re kind of down 1.5% to plus 1.5% for DD&A kind of guidance for fiscal \\'13. What type of environment, I know that you envision, I know you lay that quantitatively, but it seems to be still kind of a breakage maybe with the model in terms of the economic growth and what type of organic growth you would achieve versus that? I\\'m just trying to kind of reconcile the 2. Well, it\\'s very, very difficult to give guidance in this environment right now. We often joke it’d be a lot better to give guidance after decisions were made on Washington and how the financial cliff was going to be dealt with. But what we have done with each of the group presidents and Ron have gone to -- into each one of the groups, market-by-market to try to make a balance estimate of where we see the overall business. We believe that with the political uncertainty in Europe and the U.S., that you\\'re going to see a pretty flat growth rate. People are hesitating. It\\'s a model forward, as Didier said. And so as a result of that, you give the pluses and minuses of our market segments, which really haven\\'t changed in Q3. You can easily come into an environment of relatively low growth. Our operating model obviously doesn\\'t get the incremental when you\\'re outside of our range or bottom end of our range of 4%. And then the question comes in as do you restructure the company now to force ourselves back into the model or do we continue making the right investment for the future. And we have made the decision to continue to make the proper investments to the future while continually to focus on improving our manufacturing cost of sales or manufacturing footprint and overall productivity. Great. And maybe just one related to that. Just in terms of EMG specifically, which you think that was the big fear in the quarter, but it looks like it kind of came in close to kind of expectations. Can you just set the pace of what you saw throughout the quarter, maybe as you ended the quarter, the down 7% in orders, just kind of what do you -- kind of how are you thinking about that going forward? Well, we had a bit of state defense, as we expected sequential growth over last quarter but still under last year. And in general, all our market segment were low. Remember, the overall communication industry is lower in Q4, and that\\'s what we -- what happened in this last quarter or so. So very consistent with our expectation. Okay, in terms of the orders down 7%, that was, I mean that wasn\\'t -- I mean that kind of was consistent with the way you guys were seeing in the world? As Guy alluded to, a lot of the orders and revenue that we have recognized tends to be ahead of the holiday season, and the team has done a great job of delivering those orders. And typically, you will see it soft in Q4 and potentially soft in Q1, depending what the inventory carryover is from the holidays. Maybe just one more to sneak in. Didier, on the pension expense, can you just kind of highlight specifically, I know you kind of called that out, but how much does that factor in to kind of the $2.80 to $3.10? How should we think about that increased kind of investment in the pension plan? So in terms of the -- I mean, we are very well funded overall with our pension plan. But we were impacted by a significant reduction year-over-year on discount rates, which basically imply that our liabilities went up. Our return on assets for the fiscal year \\'12 was very good, better than our expected return on assets. But net-net, that resulted in an unexpected because we cannot forecast pension expenses. It all depends on what happens on the last day of the fiscal year. So we saw a $15 million increase, and now we\\'re all set for the fiscal year \\'13. That\\'s about $0.03 of EPS. I guess just first briefly, Bill, is there any change to the ROIC targets for fiscal year \\'13 in terms of the variable pay? No. As you know, this year we raised the return on investment capital target from 21% to 25%, and there\\'s no change in that number going forward. Okay. So that stays that way for \\'13. And there\\'s -- to be clear on Dako, I think you had guided for \\'13 I think $0.35 of accretion. I don\\'t know if you can do it this way, either maybe Didier or Bill, but if you, like, take each of your segments, can you maybe and do a walk, you did $3.12 in earnings this year. Could you maybe kind of just help us think through the -- you have Dako, it sounds like you said $30 million in operating profits I think if I\\'m doing my math right, you\\'re talking about like $0.07, and then maybe some of the decrementals that you\\'re expecting in the other business segments? Yes, it\\'s a little difficult. Yes, I was -- $30 million increase in operating profit for Dako between 2012 and 2013. For the rest, the operating margins, as answered previously, are the high end of our guidance are similar to what we have seen in 2012 on the relatively flat revenue growth. Again, I would say that it is -- our high end of the range is about 1.5% core revenue growth for the business, and at the low end minus 1.5%. But there\\'s not a fundamental -- I mean, I didn\\'t calculate the incremental corresponding because that, at 0% core revenue growth, it\\'s very difficult to calculate the incrementals. But we are really, really, really operating very -- not only in line with our operating model, but even, in fact, better than what we committed to when you think that we\\'ve reached a record operating margin both for the quarter and for the year on the -- only 2%, 2.5% core revenue growth that is way better than what we committed to in our operating model. So I guess if we think about there\\'s pretty narrow range of core growth. I think you said, right, minus 1.5% to plus 1.5%? I mean if you -- it sounds like what you were saying, Bill, in terms of restructuring, I mean if you do anything -- I mean but it looks like it\\'s a fairly wide range in terms of kind of where the margin could come in. But so if you\\'re going to be flat for the year, don\\'t expect that given what your plan is today, that you would be able to keep flat margins year-over-year. Is that kind of the message just sort of to be clear? Right now, without us restructuring and because of the increased cost of DD&A outline, we\\'ll be roughly at a 19% operating profit. At this point in time, we will not restructure to make up the difference. And so that is . Last question, I mean, Bill, what would you need to see in order to say, \"Okay, let\\'s actually take a little bit of a deeper step here?\" I think you\\'d have to have, first of all, you\\'d have to see a negative growth in the business moving forward, and that negative growth would happen beyond a year. Typically restructuring costs, enormous amount of money, enormously disruptive for the company. And to do something like that, we would have to ensure that the return it would be better than -- you get your return for making that -- those cuts within a year. So you\\'d have to see a fair amount larger drop in business, and the duration would have to be beyond a year or at least forecasted beyond a year. An additional comment on the 19%. This is on the overall Agilent business, including Dako, which still has, especially with investments that we\\'ve committed to make, a lower operating margin than the rest of Agilent. We\\'re very close to upholding our business, our margins quite high in a slow growth environment. And obviously if, in fact, that we are wrong, economy does recover and I always joke if we had a budget resolution in Washington a Eurobond and $0.5 trillion Chinese stimulus, our view might be a lot different. We\\'re still going to be able to get the type of leverage that we\\'ve got in the past. Bill, in your comments, you commented on the pricing environment a number of times. Can you just talk about where you\\'re experiencing some of the greatest pressures, and whether you get a little bit more aggressive on price going forward? Any big deal where the customer is getting multiple bids from all of our competitors, we\\'re going to have pricing pressure moving forward. We\\'ve actually done a very good job this year of holding our discounts across the company. Again, we measure those. But as Didier said and I have said, if you go in to an environment of slow growth, you just don\\'t have as much leverage in terms of the overall pricing. And so to not assume that there\\'s going to be some downward pressure I think would be unrealistic, and that\\'s the message that we\\'re conveying. And then in your comment a minute ago, you joked about China stimulus. But can you just talk about whether you\\'re expecting a reacceleration in China over the coming year? And how much of that will be EMG versus Life Sciences and other areas? So right now in China, EMG is down because that\\'s where most of the end communication test equipment ends up. As it stands now, and Guy can correct me, that the G4 standard in China is now not going to even be approved until March. And so I believe there\\'s not going to be a lot of growth in the first half of the year. Our overall analytical business in terms of Chemical Analysis and Life Science, the revenue is modest this quarter. The good news was that the orders themselves were in the teens. And as I said, we continue to leverage our infrastructure for Dako\\'s products inside of China. So given all the issues in the world, China is still the #1 story and one could imagine that if our order trend continues that China could, in fact, see a pickup, particularly in the second half of the year. And then maybe last one for Didier. As we think about the guidance, are you baking in extra conservatism here given the experience you had in 2012? If you could just talk about the philosophy behind guidance, if you will? Right, it\\'s -- I mean it\\'s tough to say that we\\'re either conservative or not. I mean we look at the -- in terms of the GDP projections that our guidance is anchored on, we\\'re assuming that flat GDP growth at about 3% until at least the end of the first calendar quarter. So that\\'s basically going into our third fiscal year -- fiscal quarter, and then going up slightly 3.4% from that. So it\\'s really we\\'re assuming more of the same of what we have seen in the last quarter or 2 for the next 2 quarters and then potentially a little bit of an improvement. There\\'s no doubt that as we\\'ve said many times, our -- when we provide a guidance range, I mean as executives, our target incentive is based on at least the highest -- the high end of the guidance, but that doesn\\'t mean in itself that it\\'s -- there\\'s a level of conservatism. I mean we\\'re setting the bar at the right level for executives. So I guess if we sort of take everything together that\\'s happened, I mean the global economy has obviously been challenging, and that\\'s made your core difficult to grow from an EBIT perspective. And then we have all these moving parts. It seems like the new numbers, probably from what most of us were expecting in terms of the outcome, were more so around through the pension expense in the comp. I guess as you\\'re sort of stepping back, it was a busy year. You guys have a fairly big acquisition. It\\'s a tough environment. You\\'re looking at an equity that\\'s been sort of in this level in the mid to high-30s for quite a while going back, x sort of the period where we used to press in \\'08, \\'09. What do you feel like from like a market perspective in terms of what the stock is telling you given all of this mix? I mean what -- how are you -- what are you most focused on? I mean when you step back and you say, \"You know what, I need to keep investing in the business, I don\\'t need to do more cost pruning. I don\\'t need to aggressively do something different with capital deployment.\" And the stocks sort of sitting where it is, what do you think the disconnect is between sort of what you\\'re executing on the plan and kind of what the market\\'s telling you? Well, the market is telling us that for the investors, that they are still skeptical on the revenue projections moving forward. If you in fact lower the revenue, then the valuation of the company quickly comes into range. Our #1 focus is to invest where business is driven by the emerging market. Our other priority is to invest in the segments of the measurement market more that we believe we can get more growth out in the average communications or on the Life Science side, the mass spectrometers, the investment in pathology across the board or energy and Chemical Analysis. We need to continue to focus on where we think the longer-term megatrends of investment are, and that\\'s what we\\'re going to do. And I believe that when the investor community feels either more confident in the macro economy, more confident that we\\'re going to be able to execute on the investments that we\\'re making in the higher growth areas, then the results will turn around moving forward. But the fundamental issue is, as I believe, that our overall revenue growth rate projections are being discounted. And so I guess I understand that, but I guess when you look at other -- I mean there was something -- it was a Wall Street Journal article, they say something like 50% of businesses in S&P 100 are talking about cost controls and sort of CapEx controls for next year given the uncertainty. Now I get -- when you are sort of sitting there and debating whether or not the incremental/decremental margin you\\'re sort of delivering on next year given sort of the fact you\\'re kind of deciding to eat some of these incremental costs. I mean as you\\'re sort of debating that versus the growth outlook, I mean was it really just a function of you look back at \\'08, \\'09 and you said, \"All right, maybe we cut too hard in certain places,\" or \"Maybe we think we\\'ll competitively disadvantage ourselves if we do so.\" I\\'m just trying to get the sense for what was the key sort of determinant because we\\'re seeing other businesses that I guess are spending more time on the middle part of the P&L given the fact the top lines, in general, were kind of constraint? So if you go back to the question on 2009, there we had unique opportunity. One is that we did dramatically reduce the size of our corporate infrastructure. And secondly, we reset the operating model in our Electronic Measurement business under Ron\\'s leadership moving forward. However, during that period of time, we did not make dramatic cuts overall in research and development. So if you look at today in the corporate infrastructure, we will continue to negotiate with our vendors to try to get better IT support costs and supporting our real estate. And then that\\'s an ongoing business moving forward. But the other 2 big buckets of money are related to sales and R&D. And in the sales area, not making investment for the future, not making the investment to continue to expand in BRIC, I think would be highly shortsighted. On the research and development side, disrupting that organization where we know we have a very, very strong pipeline of products also I think would be a terrible mistake. And finally, in terms of manufacturing, we have been very clear that we have continued to aggressively focus on manufacturing. We\\'re closing down sites. We still have a lot of work to do to get our analytical business up to 55% gross margin. And that effort is going on as quickly as we can. So again, that\\'s not new but we are continuing the progress as we noted this quarter, I think you\\'re starting to continue to see the benefits of the effort of manufacturing. But in terms of our expense structure right now, given what we know and how quickly you could change if, in fact, that we get some stability in Europe and the United States, I believe it just would not be prudent to make back and cut back our probability of winning for the long term. If I could just put Bill\\'s comments in the last question into context with the guidance, I just want to revisit some of the assumptions you have between the pension item and then sort of all the other investments you\\'re making in the business. And the reason I asked is if I looked back at the last couple of quarters you guys have done, you\\'re a little bit averaging over $0.80 a share. And if your business conditions are more or less stable versus the last couple of quarters, my assumption is that you guys should be able to annualize north of $0.80 a quarter, which would imply $320 million plus if we back out the $0.10 of the pension expense. Just wondering the balance there between what\\'s left in your guidance? Like could you maybe help us understand what those items are on the writing expense side? I\\'ll let Didier go through the numbers, but the model is very simple. We will absorb the incremental compensation cost, and we are assuming that the manufacturing cost reduction efforts that we will implement may be offset by pricing pressure in a slow growth market. But, Didier, could you go through and go through with the delta expense and compensation expenses are? Yes, the increase in pension expense is one out of many factors. I\\'ve mentioned $100 million year-over-year increase in overall compensation benefits. Obviously, the salary increases as of December 1 is half of that, the rest being either payroll taxes, increasing health expenses, stock-based compensation because our stock has gone up over the last 4 years and things like that. You have situations also like this year we didn\\'t pay out sales commissions at target. And as we reset the budget for the fiscal year, obviously we are planning now to pay our target this fiscal year on and on and on, and then offset by -- and then as Bill said, there\\'s -- the impact of the Varian -- the last tranche of the Varian\\'s cost synergies and then other cost savings coming from the manufacturing rationalization that is taking place, that we consider especially at the low end of our guidance could possibly be offset by some level of pricing pressure. So you have all those things, and I think extrapolating the Q4 EPS is very, very aggressive. Again, to offset the compensation increases, you need the calculation of how many people have to be terminated, I think it\\'d just be a terrible decision for the company at this point in time for what we know to do that. Okay, that\\'s very understandable. Let me just one more follow-up on that, which is you\\'d maybe – Didier, offer us a little bit of color on the margin assumptions you have by the business units just so as we think about the rising cost here. Is it fair to say most of it on the margin pressure should be tied to EMG? Or is there another item here in the other segments we should keep in mind as we model through the margin impact in the various segments? Yes, in terms of operating margin, again, it is -- if you exclude Dako, which has a lower operating margin than the legacy business, at the high end of our guidance, operating margin is expected to stay relatively flat versus 2012, very, very slightly lower. And there is not -- they have some improvements more in the BAM and more conservativeness for Electronic Measurement. So the 2 have kind of offset each other. Continuous improvement on the BAM front and more pressure on the Electronic Measurement because of the reasons that have been highlighted. And -- but overall for legacy Agilent, about relatively stable operating margin year-over-year. I guess a point of clarification. Bill, I think on an earlier pricing-related question, you said that you\\'re seeing pressure on big ticket items. Just want to make sure that I heard that correctly. Big ticket deals is what I had meant to say. In other words, where our customer is putting out x number of instruments for bid, those type of deals can become quite visible to the marketplace, and the buyer has a fair amount of leverage. Okay. So that being said, is the expectation that\\'s baked into guidance that it goes past these big ticket deals and that the pricing pressure actually expands into perhaps more product-providing segments in end markets? The big concern -- it doesn\\'t work that way. Biggest concern is that in a very tough pricing environment, it leaks back across the board. And again, we\\'re not assuming that, but as Didier alluded to, if in fact you go into a year of negative growth, there\\'s just lots of pricing pressure in the organization moving forward. I think the team has done a great job of holding discounts to date. But we\\'ve seen this before. And to go in and put a forecast in this environment that suggests that, that may not happen again I think just isn\\'t very realistic. Okay. And then I guess, Bill, you discussed the expectation of a challenged growth environment for fiscal 2013 given Europe and also fiscal pressures in the U.S. Can you discuss a little bit, and you touched on this, but can you discuss a little bit your expectation more so for Europe for the full year? And also, do you have any expectations around the potential for any magnitude of potential stimulus coming from China? Right. In terms of Europe, Europe, as you know, is weak. But Europe in and of itself has been difficult for us. And we\\'re not assuming any greater deterioration. We\\'re not assuming anything particularly better in Europe moving forward. I do believe in China, there is an opportunity for more focused government stimulus once the political leadership change has been settled down and things get back to normal. Okay. And then I guess just last one for Guy. I wanted to dig a little bit into your PXI business. I think you guys have been a little more aggressive in offering solutions since you entered the market, I believe, in late 2010. And I wanted to ask you how that platform is going relative to your traditional EMG business and just thoughts around your competitive positioning in that market? Yes, thanks for the question. Definitely, we have invested as you know and have a clear long-term strategy to be in this marketplace. In fact, we have and we continue introducing new products on the PXI format. And we just introduced and showed last month the fastest-switching signal generator in this form factor. So we\\'re making good progress there. Obviously, it\\'s still small in our portfolio. I remind you the strategic position we have here is that we propose to our customers the choice because they look for a total solution where the combination of modular PXI and instruments are -- is already, in general, the right solution for what they look for. So we\\'re pleased with the progress we\\'re making there. But it\\'s a long-term plan to keep building the whole portfolio. The growth rate is much greater than our core business. But it\\'s still small. Hopefully soon, you\\'ll be able to ask him how much it is for the total business, but got the advantage of a smaller base, the growth rate is good. I was hoping that Nick could spend a minute to just talk about LSG and specifically LC and Mass Spec performance and what\\'s going on with -- what\\'s been going on with the orders in the quarter there? Thanks for the question. Well, basically, what we\\'ve seen is 2 sides of the house of the markets, which is the academic government side, everybody\\'s in pause and that\\'s causing some global ramifications that\\'s not just in the U.S., so people are tied on joint grants. Pharma side is pretty solid. So in the LC and LC/MS, obviously, they play out in that factor. We do pretty well in Pharma. We\\'re still penetrating academic. LCE is the market that looks pretty soft, and we were actually down in terms of the LC market low single digits. Mass Spec, that market is still growing, and we\\'re also growing in that market. So we think that market is a good market. We recently like the LC market, but it\\'s been a bit of a pause in terms of where the things are going. And I know last quarter, you talked about $50 million in order pushouts in the overall company, and you weren\\'t expecting them all to come through this quarter. But I\\'m just curious, did you get any visibility on some of those orders coming through or did they -- were there any cancellations overall? Hopefully, we said that we had $50 million at the end of Q3 that customers did not take delivery as expected. The delivery date, of course, being get rolled over into Q4. We did not see measurable pushouts at the end of our fiscal year, so it appears to have been an anomaly in Q3 and did not repeat itself an immeasurable amount in Q4. Okay. And just my last question, in China, in LSG, any comments you can make on the competitive environment? I know it\\'s getting a little bit more competitive, but anything you can add there? Yes, I mean it\\'s essentially more of the same. It\\'s a very competitive environment. A lot of people are going there. A lot of our competitors are putting in facilities and infrastructure which we\\'ve already had, so they\\'re getting the shiny newness of that in the marketplace. But it is really still a good economy. We saw quite a solid order step-up for the quarter, although as Bill said, the overall revenue performance was pretty soft. So we think we\\'re doing pretty good. We said we were resetting the team for the next phase of growth, and we are in fact doing that. But it takes some time. We got to get people in. We got to train them. We\\'re pleased with the progress we\\'re making, but we still have progress to make. Bill, could you talk about the -- is the scope business is most competitive in this kind of environment right now? Well, I think all the segments of the market are highly competitive. Fortunately, that\\'s one area of the market where we continue to do reasonably well. But my guess is Guy wouldn\\'t change the competitiveness versus cellphone test versus scopes. I think that\\'s far more competitive. As I said, it\\'s going to be big customers, big deal across the company. And it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s a source/spectrum analyzer, mass spectrometer, anywhere where there are going to be large buys and labs or manufacturing facilities to R&D. I think you\\'re going to see a competitive environment. As I said though, the team has done a great job of holding our discounts, and we try to add in value and differentiation and aftermarket support and service. But we are clearly being or preparing for a difficult pricing environment if, in fact, our forecast is correct that we\\'re entering into continued flat market. And then as I look on Page 6 of this handout, last quarter, I guess some of the softness was centered around the aerospace defense market. What would be the 2 areas that were softest in this current quarter, Chemical, Energy and academic, or what were the 2 that has the least visibility? Outside of aerospace and defense, which is as predicted, government spending is okay. The primes are cutting back, and that\\'s well documented. The Chemical Analysis market clearly had more difficulty. And, Mike, you want -- may make couple of comments about some of the softness you had even though there was some positive in that, the orders were better. Yes, Bill, sure. As we\\'ve commented in the third quarter, we\\'ve talked a lot about the slowness in the Chemical space in our Q3 results. We saw that carry forward into the fourth quarter as well, mainly in the replacement market for chromatography products. And if you got the chance, you may have actually seen some of our major customers also make announcements in the Chemical space after the third quarter where they are either restructuring or having some plant closures. But as Bill mentioned, we do see -- feel like we\\'ve reached the bottom there. And -- but we saw that the weakness of the callout in the third quarter to continue into the fourth quarter. Okay. And then last, the China growth, negative 3% in this handout again. And were there any placement orders like the last couple of quarters where the Asia x Japan was not really negative 3%, but kind of color around anything on what core growth really was? No. I mean the -- you\\'re referring probably to a large orders in the wireless manufacturing test that we had in the second and third quarter. In the fourth quarter, as expected, the volume of orders or revenue came down, so it was not a big factor. Most of my questions have been answered. I just -- I guess a little more on the investments that you\\'re talking about, increased salaries, compensation and benefits, how much of that is for let\\'s call it existing infrastructure of people and assets? And then how much more is just actual incremental, say, feet on the street, new facilities, new marketing efforts, new product development? Can you kind of flush out these incremental costs year-over-year versus new versus legacy? The vast majority of the numbers that Didier quoted are related to the 22,000 existing employees. We will continue the investment in Dako, in the expansion in Asia, the increase in research and development. But first order, the -- all of the additional fixed costs that we\\'re seeing are related to our existing headcount. And we have no plans in this environment for measurable increase in headcount as we move forward. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just want to make -- just want to clarify something. So it sounds like the softness in the Communications business, this was more of you had really strong quarters in Q2, Q3, and this is just sort of a slowing from that rate and just a sort of delay and sort of the infrastructure build? Okay. And what about the competitive landscape there? Have you seen any new players coming in, people being more aggressive? Since Teradyne\\'s buying LitePoint, have they become more aggressive in the market? Well the overall competitiveness, as Bill was mentioning, is to across all market segments, and wireless is definitely one of those. So there are a number of competitors. You mentioned one that are pushing very hard, especially in the production environment. Right. That\\'s sort of what I was getting at. And I guess just to sort of clarify the speed, there was no further slowing as sort of the quarter went on in some of the academic end markets, basically inside, there are things you didn\\'t take another step-down that you saw -- you didn\\'t see any further hesitation on that part? No. I think they\\'re pretty much were on the brakes towards the end of our last quarter. And this is exactly what we expected in Q4. Remember that I have not been highly positive on what would happen, and it\\'s been my expectation with where we thought they would be. As you all know, I\\'m not the most optimistic guy in this environment right now. And that was the good news is academic and research and overall for the company, there really wasn\\'t much change in the end markets from Q4 to Q3. Great. And just one final question, can you sort of like give us some of your timeline projections on Dako? And when can we see -- what are we expecting to see new products coming out? And was -- could you just sort of update us on what sort of the product flow will be? Lars, why don\\'t you take that and give an update on where the integration is going and where we\\'re headed? Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. Well I think the bottom line is, as Bill and Didier alluded to, is actually some . And Dako continues to deliver the base business, which is on or slightly ahead of schedule actually. We still had some work cut out for us in terms of the ramp-up of feet on the street in APAC and so forth and also some of the buyout of indirect channels. These are things that are in place and actually going to kick in towards the back half of fiscal year \\'13. Now in terms of the very much long expected, long awaited next generation from Dako, we continue to make progress and on track for a 2013 market launch. So let me just characterize where we stand right now. As we speak, we are in a, call it a limited manufacturing ramp. And during the next I will say 3 to 4 months, we ease our way into the kind of the early test signs, and this is now then going to be expanded into kind of more what we call a beetle  side, which is kind of more of a commercial expense. And somewhere there between I would say third and fourth quarter, I do expect that all breaks are going to be altered, are going to be -- form an impact to the product availability. And this is a global one. So this is, I think, the most significant product launch that we are expecting. On top of that, we have a number of new antibodies coming out, obviously the SureFISH expansion with the probes is hitting us on a weekly basis, and this is rapidly expanding the portfolio of products that we are having. But just to characterize Dako and the -- to 2013, we are on track with the launch of . Great. And just one quick one. Nick, what are you doing to sort of revamp the cytogenetics pipeline and the product portfolio there? There\\'s a lot of new -- obviously with Illumina buying BlueGnome and assay getting so bad there, how are you kind of going after and revamping the side of product? Well I\\'ve got lots of opinions, but I have the great opportunity to share those with Lars. And Lars has been managing that. So I\\'m going to kick this to him, and if he wants the other comments, I\\'ll let him kick it back to me. Well, thank you, Nick. It\\'s my pleasure to take that on. Well, I\\'m sure as you guys noted that we made a joint announcement together with NimbleGen on the array side just a couple of weeks ago. So we are now in a coordinated effort moving forward to convert the customer base, and that is a fairly significant amount of customer and business. And we will continue to make a fairly rapid progress in that regard. And we are obviously rapidly expanding our SureFISH line of products. We currently have 450 FISH probes, and we have 15 new probes actually targeting leukemia. So what you\\'ll see is going to be a very concentrated effort around our FISH business, our array business, but also around the basic target, in which I\\'m pleased with Halo flakes. That continues to make a terrific progress as we are actually exceeding our expectations in that regard. So it\\'s going to be a very focused effort from our side in those areas. Bill, 2 questions. One, you commented that you believe there would be a budget resolution. And I\\'m sorry to ask this, but what gives you that level of confidence and why doesn\\'t the overall business environment with respect to spending or business spending get materially worse? And then likewise, and perhaps inversely, if there is a resolution, why doesn\\'t business spending actually get materially better? And you\\'ve kind of hit the midpoint, I guess, to some degree, but I would actually argue that there is potentially a greater window for sales to have either the higher upside and then likewise sales to have even greater downside? Appreciate some comments. Well, you just said the 2 bookends of our discussion for the last 2 weeks on how to give guidance in facing of the financial or the fiscal cliff moving forward. Our forecast assumes that there\\'s a resolution. That\\'s not my own personal opinion, but that\\'s just the overall assumption. I -- as you know, the odds are somewhere between 30% to 50% that there won\\'t be a resolution. But assuming that there is moving forward, I think that because of the delay of resolution, you are already starting to slow down. You\\'re heading into the holiday season so for -- the way our fiscal year is constructed, one could easily see a Q1 that is soft and potentially a Q2. I won\\'t argue with you. If there is a successful budget resolution, then the second half of the year things could get better. And of course if that happens, then we\\'ll adjust our forecast accordingly moving forward. But at this point in time, we have been completely candid on what our thinking is and try to give the best outlook we can with the available amount of data we have. And we all know that there is a wide potential outcome. Just 2 questions, I guess maybe for Guy or Didier. When you look at the EMG business and you look at the order number in the fourth quarter, typically we built some backlog, typically we have a book-to-bill that\\'s well north of 1 in EMG. And what I guess I\\'m a bit concerned about is does the first half of the year look like down 15% to 20% with the back half for the year up 20% to 25%, is that the way the revenue distribution would look? For fiscal year \\'13? No, no. It\\'s way flatter than that. But basically Q1 would be fairly similar than to Q4 in terms of revenue decremental. In Q4, we had 4% core revenue decline year-over-year. But you took about $60 million out of backlog, right? I mean I\\'m just -- I mean generally speaking, your first quarter is 90% of your fourth quarter orders, which would put you sub $700 million in sales. But that\\'s not the case. He can talk to you. And we have looked at the same numbers as you have for Q4, and have done the exercise and that led us to the kind of guidance that I\\'m mentioning. Again in Q4, our core revenue growth was -- decline was about -- was 4% and in Q1, we expect something more like 5% to 6% revenue decline. That\\'s embedded in our guidance. Just as a clarification again, the guidance that we\\'re giving that made up over for EMG is still for a revenue number that is below the incoming order rate in Q4. So again, I don\\'t -- we look at all of those, and we don\\'t think it\\'s out of bounds. Obviously, that\\'s the number that tends to have the more volatility. But I think mathematically and what we know the pipeline is, we feel okay. Okay. And then just one other thing, I mean aerospace defense you usually have a bit more visibility there. Obviously, one area that could be pretty impacted here depending on what happens within negotiations, budget negotiations. What do the orders in aerospace defense look like in the fourth quarter? This is Guy. We had better orders in gross compared to last year in aerospace defense for this quarter. The year-end business has been there as we were expecting it and in fact, we\\'re still expecting this coming into the last 2 months of this year. So I would say it was still -- it was positive. Again, Guy, correct me if I\\'m wrong, because a lot of the spending comes from the government, use it or lose it... Most frankly will happen. The primes is where we\\'re seeing a cutback in anticipation of the actual direct government spending most likely will play out as predicted for the end of the year? At this time, I\\'m showing no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Thank you, Derek. On behalf of the management team, we\\'d like to thank everybody for joining our call today, and also wish you a happy holiday in advance of the season. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\\'s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I\\'ll be your conference coordinator for today.  As a reminder, today\\'s event is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Alicia. Thank you, Regina, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2013. With me are Agilent\\'s CEO, Bill Sullivan; as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s President and Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian. Also joining are the Presidents of our Electronic Measurement Group, Chemical Analysis and Diagnostics and Genomics groups, Guy Séné, Mike McMullen and Lars Holmkvist. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for financial results, where you will find revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Bill and Didier\\'s comments today will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Before turning the call over to Bill, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its annual Analyst Meeting in New York City on March 7. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent Investor website 2 weeks prior to that date. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. For Agilent\\'s fiscal first quarter, orders were $1.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, inclusive of the benefits in the Dako acquisition. Revenue of $1.68 billion were up 3%, again with the benefit of the Dako acquisition, but in the low-end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $0.63 were $0.02 below the low-end of our guidance due entirely to some unexpected onetime expenses. The company has struggled with the predictability of revenue and EPS performance over the past 4 quarters. While we have delivered EPS above the midpoint guidance in aggregate, we have missed our EPS guidance in 2 of the last 4 sequential quarters and have exceeded EPS guidance in the other 2 quarters. The problem is the volatility of revenue and orders in the last month of the quarter. Last year\\'s third quarter EPS shortfall was due to the unexpected push out of deliveries. This quarter, we again experienced an unexpected last-minute push out of deliveries, mostly in the communication market. In addition, while we were pleased with our strong January orders, over half of January\\'s orders were received in the last 5 days of the month. Our order fulfillment team did an outstanding job of meeting the low-end of our revenue guidance, but we missed our internal revenue forecast by $35 million, which decreased our earnings per share by $0.05. With the lower revenue, we were not able to absorb the unexpected expenses. We ask for patience from our shareholders as our customers continue to face challenging delivery need. Agilent maintains a flexible delivery policy, and we are committed to be the best measurement partner for our customers as they meet their own business challenges. Moving forward, we are widening our quarterly guidance range to set better expectations for our investors. We now anticipate likely cutbacks in defense spending, which accounts for about 10% of Agilent\\'s business, and continued softness in the Communications market. As a result, we\\'re lowering our revenue guidance for the year, as well as our EPS range. We continue to control expenses well. We are driving down our variable spending as to reduce our flex force and we are aggressively implementing our manufacturing consolidation plan. As we continue to manage through end market and customer uncertainties, we are encouraged by the strong January orders, the breadth of new product launches and the benefits of the expense reductions we expect to see for the remaining part of the year. Within the businesses, our newly formed Diagnostics and Genomics groups revenue grew 145%, up 4% organically. The integration of Dako continues to proceed well. We saw a mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in pathology standing market and high-growth in expanding our Pharma partnership as evidenced by the recently announced partnerships with Eli Lilly and Pfizer. We are also pleased with our strong, high-single digit sequential growth in revenue as we continue to expand our sales team in Asia and launch new products. For example, our HER2 IQ FISH was approved by the FDA. Datalink was upgraded as the market\\'s leading software tool, linking all of Dako\\'s instruments together for optimal lab control and workflow optimization and the launch of our new automated stainer remains on track for commercial release. Our overall Genomics business grew in low-single digits with a continued strength in CGH arrays for clinical market. SureFISH sales continue to see high renewal rate. Our Life Science business grew 2% year-over-year. Academic and government markets were flat, with modest growth in Pharma markets and mid-single-digit sequential growth. We continue to see solid growth in our Consumables and Service business and modest growth in our LC instrument platform. While we saw a decrease in our LC/MS business due to difficult year-over-year compares, orders grew in the low double-digits. We also introduced several new products in the quarter to improve LC detection and increase workflow productivity. Chemical Analysis revenues were down slightly year-over-year, due entirely to the decline in our environmental market. This is the second quarter in a row of weak environmental sales. The fundamental cause is lower government spending. We continue to see strong growth in the forensics market and flat to modest growth in food and petrochemical. At the beginning of February, we announced the introduction of our new 7890B gas chromatograph, and the 5977A series single quad Mass Spec. These next generation products offer industry-leading productivity, sensitivity and reliability. Electronic Measurement revenues were down 7% over last year. This was mostly due to a decrease in the wireless handset market after a period of strong investment, but compounded by push outs of delivery. Base Station investment remained soft, as we await the rollout of LTE in other major regions around the world. Orders did strengthen in January as we ended the quarter with a book-to-bill greater than one. And even as we manage through the current market volatility, we continue to ensure that we have market-leading product. We introduced the InfiniiVision 4000 X-series oscilloscope, the only upgradable family of 5-in-1 oscilloscopes in the industry. And on February 8, we introduced the industry\\'s highest performing real time Spectrum Analyzer for our PXA signal analyzers. As a reminder, in January we announced the 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share, as well as stock repurchase program up to $500 million during fiscal year 2013. These moves reflect our confidence in our ability to manage the present business volatility, our ability to generate cash and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. As Bill stated, it has become more challenging to predict the short-term outcomes. 70% of our revenue is related to capital expenditures, where customers\\' buying decisions are heavily dependent on overall demand and business confidence, both at low levels in today\\'s world of uncertainty. Because of customers\\' delays in placing orders, shipments were also delayed. As a result, we achieved only the low end of our revenue guidance. However, we missed the low-end of our EPS guidance by $0.02 due to unexpected and onetime items. Three items made up most of the $0.02. They relate to customs duties in a foreign jurisdiction, unclaimed property claims in the U.S. and a balance sheet hedging loss. For a company of our size and complexity, such items, both positive and negative, are not unusual. However, this is the first time that they all were unfavorable. To recap the quarter, core orders were flat year-over-year, while core revenue decreased 2% and our operating margin, always the lowest of the year in Q1, was slightly over 17%. By segment, EMG core revenue decreased 7% year-over-year. CAG was up 1%, LSG 3% and DGG 6%. By region, Americas was down 1%, Europe, 2%; Japan, 6%; and the rest of Asia Pacific, 2%, all on a core revenue basis. Now turning to cash. We generated $245 million in operating cash flow. By far, the largest Q1 cash flow generation since Q1 of 2000. We bought back 2 million shares for $79 million and are back to a net cash position of over $150 million. Now turning to the guidance for the full year. As Bill stated, the low-end of our guidance now assumes sequestration will take place, while the high-end reflects a slower economic recovery, lower government spending and softer communication markets than previously assumed. Also, currency is expected to have a negative revenue impact of about $35 million for the year, versus the November guidance. Fiscal year \\'13 revenue is expected to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, or 2% reported growth at midpoint, which translates into 1% core revenue decrease. As you compare those projections with those of our peers, please note the different product and customer mix. We generally have a higher mix of instruments versus recurring revenues, and are more exposed to the industrial and defense market, as well as to Japan. On an apple-to-apple basis, we are gaining ground in many of our businesses, but current results and short-term projections are skewed by our mix. On the cost front, our global order fulfillment organization is on track to generate about $50 million of savings, and our control of discretionary expenses is nearly of the same magnitude as during the 2009 downturn. Those actions, coupled with the benefit of the incremental stock buyback program, will partially offset the impact of lower revenue projections and currency headwinds on our EPS, which is expected to range from $2.70 to $3. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. As Bill stated, we are widening our guidance range for the quarter for both revenue and EPS. We expect Q2 revenue of $1.74 billion to $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.64 to $0.70. So obviously, a lot of questions to go through here. So I\\'ll let others hop in. But I guess, very big picture on some of your last comments, Didier, around cost control. Can you maybe just, given the fact that things seem to be a little bit slower, and I guess you\\'re not anticipating them getting much better, even though some macro indicators actually suggest like things could get better in the second half, can you maybe just walk us through exactly what you\\'re doing on the cost side? And maybe why you\\'re not being a little bit more aggressive? Let me make that comment, John, if you don\\'t mind, for Didier, the details. Fundamentally, I\\'m actually more optimistic than I was last quarter. As you know, I\\'ve tended to be somewhat pessimistic. If you look at where some of our growth opportunities are, the introduction of our new products, there\\'s actually signs that things are going to get better. So I believe that not continuing to expand in emerging markets, not continuing our R&D investments, not continuing our reach, is just a bad strategy moving forward right now. As a result of that, Ron and Didier have put together a detailed plan of ensuring not only are we going to drive $40 million of manufacturing cost out, and this is the first time we\\'ve announced the quantity of that, that we are in the process of eliminating our temporary workforce, managing all non-customer, non-new product introductions. And if you go back to the 2009 downturn, which is quite severe where we, in fact, weren\\'t making 17% operating profit, we were able to take substantial amount of money out of the system. So we are aggressively implementing that moving forward. Our guidance policy has been the same at this point in time. The forecast for the rest of the year is $7.1 billion of revenue and $3 a share, that\\'s our outlook. But we are widening the downside because of the continued volatility that we are seeing at -- over, that we\\'ve seen over the last 4 quarters. Okay. So just maybe on those cost savings that you just announced, maybe just give us a little better sense of kind of how long it will take for the -- and when we\\'ll start to see those in the numbers? I mean those are immediate the eliminating the temporary workforce, I guess, but maybe some of the manufacturing cost out and some of the other savings initiatives. When should those start to -- when should we start to see the full impact of those? We will see the full impact of this as we go through quarter for quarter. And Jon, quite frankly, and for the other analysts, we have had to stop the volatility of our announcement. We are going to take a broader range to set fair expectations moving forward, and we are going to do everything possible as a management team to ensure that we become more predictable in this slow growth environment moving forward. And so we have built into the $3 upper end range, the manufacturing cost reduction, and if we\\'re successful getting more variable cost, that will become a hedge against any volatility in the topline. Okay, and then if I can, just one more, on just the guidance itself. I mean it looks like your revenue outlook is slightly -- we\\'re saying the midpoint, before it was flat, now you\\'re kind of minus 1%. And if I just -- if I do the quick math, you get to the $0.10 that you\\'re talking about. I mean, it just seems like you\\'re letting that flow-through 100% of that. Am I missing anything else? Are there any other things going on for that $0.10 that you\\'re lowering the guidance for, for the year? Just $100 million of lower revenue, that would translate into $0.14, just to be precise. So there\\'s some offset to that, and that\\'s why we\\'re only -- and I mentioned those offsets in my scripts and that\\'s why we are reducing the EPS by $0.10 and not by $0.14. Didier, did you mention how much buyback you\\'ve put into your numbers at this point, for the rest of \\'13 and then I\\'d love to hear Bill\\'s perspective if anything has changed on the political front, on the tax repatriation issue. I mean, do you see any resolution to that dynamic in 2013? Anything you\\'re willing to offer there would be great. Yes, I\\'ll answer the first question. So the forecast assumes we utilize all of the $500 million before the end of the fiscal year. And that we finish the year with 347 million -- on the last quarter, 347 million shares versus the 352 million we had in the Q1. And in terms of, regards the likelihood of a change of tax policy this year, I remain skeptical that anything will be accomplished. Okay. If you look at the remainder of the year, Bill, can you just talk about, it seems like with a surge in orders in the last month. It just seems like you sound more positive, yet the numbers are coming down. Help us reconcile what incremental caution you\\'ve baked in from here, I guess it\\'s not clear to me. If orders are improving, why you\\'re not a little bit more bullish about the top line? Well, as I said, I think that, first of all, there is a likelihood of defense cutbacks. Again, we\\'ll know on March 1, as we have said. And there is evidence out there that the cell phone market after a huge investment may, in fact, be slowing down. And again, there\\'ve been some other independent articles written on that. So you couple those 2, the outlook and again, when we give guidance, it\\'s very clear, the top line is what our forecast is, and then we decrement for there for the volatility, and unfortunately, we\\'ve been too narrow in this environment. And so if you combine the likely outhood in U.S. Defense spending, coupled with any sort of slowing in the communication markets, that is why we took the top line number of last quarter\\'s $7.2 billion and lowered it to $7.1 billion. Yes, the third factor I have mentioned is that, in the last 3 months, the yen has weakened 20% versus the dollar. And overall the currency impact is a reduction in revenue for the whole year at the present actions rate, about $35 million. So that\\'s also a component of the $100 million. It\\'s just pure currency. Understood. Last thing, are you likely to know what form the defense cuts will take on March 1? And what I mean by that is, are you just assuming a ubiquitous cut in your defense business? Or do you actually have clarity on specific programs that you\\'re in, that may receive funding reductions or the mix, basically the mix of the cuts? There\\'s preliminary work was done by Guy\\'s team, and again I don\\'t know if Guy has any additional color, but right now, if you assume they muddle through with a moderate cut, the impact, we believe, would be 10% on our U.S. Defense. Worst-case scenario would be 20%. So they -- so they\\'ve modeled that to the best that they -- they can. Yes, this is Guy. I just second what Bill said, that clearly this is what we have modeled in, a 10% decrease. Bill, so I understand that widening your guidance range will allow you to end up in ranges going forward, but I\\'m curious what programs you\\'re implementing internally to improve your order book visibility and decrease the final week of the month loading that happens with the company? Besides praying, let me just share with you, the situation. So we deal with thousands of customers every quarter. The top 25 customers purchased in Q1 $275 million, that\\'s an average of $11 million a customer. 80% of the delivery changes came from these 25 customers. And again, Agilent historically has had very liberal delivery policies moving forward, we work with our customers, they have their own set of issues, and so you can see -- and again, we had this quarter nailed on January 16 when I spoke to the Board of Directors. And all of a sudden, someone says, \"Hey, look, I can\\'t take the delivery for X, Y or Z reason,\" and you\\'re sort of stuck. And you can\\'t invoice and so you can\\'t recognize revenue. Even the late orders, our manufacturing team did a great job turning the orders, got them in the pipeline, but we just couldn\\'t recognize revenue based on, as you know, very, very tight revenue recognition rules. So I wish I could say something magical, I think it would be a bad mistake not to work with our customers, I mean they have their own set of issues. But in this environment, which is a slower growth environment, any change out of one of these big customers can become a surprise. And it\\'s happened 2 out of the last 4, and the flip side of it is, to the other 2 quarters, we\\'ve been over guidance as you know, quite substantially. So I think as long as that we\\'re in a slower growth environment, around flat, we\\'re going to have more volatility. The answer, of course is, is to get back into our operating model of 4% -- low-end of our operating model of 4% organic growth rate, and I think that the signal noise ratio will just become lower. But I -- right now, unfortunately, there is not a magic answer right now, just given how concentrated the surprise has been in 2 of the last 4 quarters. The good news is, these orders aren\\'t getting canceled. I mean, this is not a 2001, 2009 where all heck broke out and people are canceling orders. This is just strictly the issue of your assumptions to the end of the quarter. Didier said we are a highly capitalized capital equipment company. A lot of the revenue goes out the last month of the quarter, and over the years, it\\'s been predictable. The last 4 quarters, is not, we have not done a good job predicting. And Bill, a follow-up on CAG and softness in Environmental. We haven\\'t heard that, kind of heard the opposite at some of the other companies. So can you tell me where, globally, some of the softness is coming from? And any other specifics you can give on the Environmental side? Yes, I\\'ll do that. A couple of comments. I have been at some companies that they have mentioned this, and again we sort of have a unique position in environmental test labs, so Mike, why don\\'t you go ahead and respond to that. Yes, sure Bill. First of all, just reminder, I would say that Agilent probably has the strongest position in the Environmental Testing market, with the breadth of our portfolio. So movements there are really amplified in terms of our total result. But to the specific question, where we\\'ve seen it is -- been in the U.S. marketplace, both at the federal, and state and local level, as well as Europe. Japan also is weak, so the story is, U.S., Europe and Japan. The emerging markets, Brazil, India and China continue to vest in these areas, but it\\'s not enough to offset the challenge we\\'ve seen in some of the more mature geographies. I would say there is a bright note, if you will, that\\'s emerging on the U.S. side, which is the push in the area of frac-ing, which actually is starting to increase the sample sizes  coming into the private contract lab, the Environmental side. So but the, again, not enough to overwhelm the downside on the government\\'s spending side. And again, I would just point out that we\\'re particularly leveraged here, given our strength in this marketplace. Hi, this is Vijay in for Ross. My first one was in the communications market, Berlin . I know that you sort of alluded to the fact that the communications, I mean, we might be peaking in the smartphone market. That\\'s been a large part of the growth story here. Could you lay out sort of what the base case is for action, what\\'s the house view? What are you guys thinking on the cell phone markets? And how we\\'d sort of look at that market on a 2 to 3-year time frame? Go ahead, Guy, why don\\'t you give, latest perspective and again, you have to remember, we have an infrastructure, we have a leading position. We have the components and chipset and then we\\'ve got the handhelds. So Guy, why don\\'t you give a overview of what the latest thinking is. Yes, your question was on the long-term. And clearly on the long-term, we still believe that the overall smartphone growth is solid. And most especially all the data that these smartphones are using among also all the other devices, the mobile devices like tablet. So that\\'s clearly the major growth engine for the industry. And then, obviously, for our Test & Measurement solution, as we address not only the R&D and manufacturing for the devices, but as Bill was just mentioning, we have a very strong position in the infrastructure. And here, I must say that we start having more, or at least better news as you probably heard, the U.S. operators are planning to add more CapEx in infrastructure. There\\'s been movement in China around the 4G allocation, that is for China mobile. No firm date yet, and that\\'s a little bit, the uncertainty that we have short term. But the overall infrastructure market is something that we should start seeing coming up later in the year. So that\\'s clearly what I would add for now. Got it. And maybe my next question, for Didier, and I know that, Didier, you mentioned on the last call, a lot of folks asked on restructuring. And sort of the way you laid out the case was depending on the environment, and the environment at that time did not warrant for a restructuring. And I guess one quarter in, you\\'re looking at sort of fluctuation order flows, and volatility in some of the markets. We\\'re also looking at maybe a potential sequestration, maybe a little bit of softening on the Com side. What would sort of prompt you to take a more -- want to take more, I guess, significant restructuring activities and get the earnings up? Okay, now let me start answering, then probably Bill would want to also say a word. The first thing is that it is not that we\\'re not doing any restructuring. We are doing restructuring. It is very circumscribed. It is very well defined as we are reorganizing our manufacturing footprint and really going after the cost synergies that we\\'re already committed to on the Varian side and the further cost synergies on the other front. So there is a lot of restructuring that is going on, but it is not broad-based and it is not indiscriminate. It is very, very well defined. And then for the rest, I think Bill already addressed the question. We do still -- we don\\'t see any change to the secular growth rate of the company, and we do see opportunities in the midterm. Which means that we are not ready to do something that is more indiscriminate and similar to what we have seen in 2009. Bill, do you want to add to it? I just agree. I think that, given where we are now, putting the company in some sort of oscillation with taking out some of our core, given the opportunities we have, the products that we have in pipeline, to be able to move the EPS by a few cents. We know what to do. We have a great track record to make that happen. And right now, we are going to continue to invest and continue to be a leader in the Measurement market. I was just wondering if Mike or Nick can maybe break out the instrument declines or growth in the LSG and CHG   segments for, versus Consumables? Yes, Mike, do you want to do that? And again, I apologize, Nick is overseas right now. He\\'s not on this call, but Mike, could you give a flavor at least on the GCs and LCs and Mass Spec and... Yes, sure. I think the overall answer would be is, we\\'ve seen continued, really solid growth, both in our Consumables business and Services business. The growth, as Didier mentioned, are relative to the instruments, and are tied to the capital expenditures of our customers, is actually more depressed. But with some bright spots in certain places where we\\'ve got our Spectroscopy business growing, and I think Bill earlier in this call pointed to the growth in LC/MS and LC. I would say on our gas-based business, which is the franchise business for the Chemical Analysis group, we continue to be challenged there a bit, given the weakness in the Industrial segment and the Environmental marketing we talked about earlier but actually down slightly and the situation is stabilized. And I must say we\\'re actually fairly optimistic, moving forward, because as of the 1st of February, we launched 2 major new products, which replace our franchise -- I mean our flagship products in that core business. So the long and short of it is the aftermarket, our Service and Consumables business continues to do quite well, growing faster right now that our Instrument business and then the, as I said earlier, some parts of the portfolio are growing faster than others on the instrument side. Okay, appreciate that. And I realize that the competitive dynamic is pretty stiff in several of your markets, so I guess any thoughts on whether or not you think there\\'s a share change dynamic that may be impacting growth anywhere in the business? As Didier alluded to, we don\\'t believe there\\'s any substantive change in terms of share. Clearly, some of our markets where we\\'re really strong, become weaker and by defect there\\'s a shift. But in terms of anything fundamental, competitor to competitor in a specific market, we don\\'t believe there\\'s anything fundamentally that\\'s changed. Okay. And if I could just maybe sneak in a last one. Your perspective on Europe at this point, just given the outlook that you gave and the last time around, that you -- the expectations were not much in the way of improvement, but also not deterioration. Could you just sort of give us a way that you are looking at Europe? Yes, I think Europe and the U.S., it\\'s muddled forward. The last quarter we had before, we faced lots of issues in the U.S. As I said last quarter, the Europeans\\' appeared to stabilized, the situation in the U.S. has actually a bit stabilized. And so overall, it\\'s more positive. But I think that the opportunities in U.S., Europe and Japan are -- it\\'s going to be a tough environment. That\\'s why we need to continue to invest in new products and continue to invest in emerging markets. At least a question on -- so from some sequestration, can you just quantify that $65 million operating revenue decline that you built in there. How much of that dollar amount is due to the impact of the sequestration? On the top line, the -- we, there\\'s $200 million delta between the high-end and the low end of the range. And clearly, the low-end incorporates sequestration scenario. On the high-end, it is not a full figure sequester. It is really, really tight budget spending. But not a complete sequester of the sort that we have baked into the low-end of the range. So it\\'s not -- sequestration is not the scenario for the high-end, or at least a permanent sequester is not a scenario for the high end of the range. And again it\\'s that model is that 10% of our business is with the Department of Defense and -- or excuse me, in the defense market, of which 65% is U.S. only. So that\\'s the range of the exposure that we have. Okay. And then maybe, within the Communications segment, can you just fill in a little deeper, like specifically you call out handset weakness, you call out Base-Station weakness. Was it -- could you give us a little color, was it a particular, one large vendor that you basically -- I know the second quarter you have a tougher comp from that production order that you captured last year. But could you give a little more color, just on what\\'s going on within the headset market? Is it a pause ahead of maybe, some of the impact the buildout of some of these systems that we\\'re going to see an uptick, or -- because, I guess, when we looked at -- when you listen to some of the competitors, while things aren\\'t good, at least I\\'ve seem to be signaling things are pointing in the right direction right now. So I\\'m just trying to figure out what\\'s going on there. Right now, in Q1, we said we expected the business to roll off because of the investment leading into the new year. So -- and I think that has been universal across the market. So we knew that the Q1s, particularly our Q1 is going to be lighter moving forward. Then the guess is, what\\'s going to happen. Really easy to say, everything is going to be great. There are lots of external articles as Guy alluded to, that are suggesting that the growth of smartphones, even though it\\'s the hottest part of the market, may in fact be slowing. The total cell phone market growth for the year is only targeted at 1%. And so, again, we are a conservative company, laying out exactly what we see. If the other guys are right, we\\'ll do better. But right now we don\\'t hope for things, we just try to look at the best data that we have available to us at what\\'s going to happen. And again, we\\'ve been doing cell phone tests for over 10 years. And before that under HP I used to run the RF microwave group, inside of Hewlett-Packard, finding components. This stuff is highly volatile, in -- as people build up for capacity and then, of course, utilize that capacity as the markets slow down. And of course, there\\'s huge changes from vendor to vendor and who wins, which also has a second order effect on investment. And then maybe one final, just related to that, Bill. But so does that portend any real scenes in the way you\\'re operating your Comm business, I mean it sounds kind of negative. If the smartphone market\\'s really kind of slowing, is there a point going forward that -- an earlier question alluded to. I think Guy mentioned China, we have 4G licenses somewhat coming in this country  but how long could this pause, in this smartphone market occur and kind of what are you doing internally to deal with it? Well, I would say it\\'s a -- I wouldn\\'t see it as a pause, first. There is ongoing investment happening. And as you know, most of the overall manufacturing investment that are aligned the new product introductions is usually happening more into Q2, Q3. So I would not say there\\'s a pause. But in the same time, the fact that some of the smartphones are really aligned with 2 major companies, it has an efficiency play in the manufacturing that we have to take into account when we forecast our business with them. The wildcard is to see if there are other companies, the Chinese companies and some smaller player, and understand when they will come up with some of the devices around LTE, for instance. And that\\'s still in the cards, and we\\'ve not seen it yet, but obviously, it will happen at one moment. Didier, just want to get back to an earlier point on, just sort of the forecasting in the visibility in the quarter, and what you\\'re going to do to work on that. Would you be able to share some of the specific actions that you\\'re taking to improve your forecasting methods, because it does seem to me that widening the guidance range is helpful, but not necessarily something that specifically addresses the key issues there when it comes to forecasting going forward. Yes, and Bill addressed that in saying that a lot of the issues just come from customers that we -- and we\\'re absolutely determined to give them the flexibility that they need in order to operate in a very volatile environment for them, too. So it is not so much -- look at it as customer satisfaction kind of issue also. That we are not going to fight the customers if they want to have a little bit more flexibility within the last minute to serve their need. I don\\'t know, Bill? I can\\'t say it any clearer than that. $20 million of revenues, $0.03 a share. And we are not going to change our policy towards our customers in working with them on delivery. A lot of these deliveries, they can have installations and all the rest. We\\'re in a slower growth environment. We know the pluses and minuses of how people run their business. We\\'re shipping capital equipment, and it is just very easy to have, for example, a $20 million change at the last minute and that\\'s $0.03. And there\\'s just no way you can recover it at the end of the quarter. And so that\\'s where we are. Yes, will we do a better job of second-guessing our customers? Sure. What the net result is, that you end up lowering your guidance, right? And because you\\'re surely not going to bet on anybody accelerating receipt in this environment, unless the economy turns around. And just in a big catch-22, and we\\'re just being as transparent as we can and again, hopefully, given the actions that we\\'re taking to minimize on the downside and again, continue to focus on increasing our organic growth rate that the volatility that we\\'ve seen in the last 4 quarters will dissipate in time. Okay, and then just to be -- that\\'s helpful. And then just maybe to follow-up on the comment on the $20 million and $0.03. Just to be clear -- that entirely is tied to timing of orders, not -- and to be specific, not tied to anything related to market share. And I think there was a question asked earlier about sort of how you guys map up versus your competitors. Just trying to be clear that, there wasn\\'t anything in the quarter, in your opinion, that had to do with market share or large contracts switching hands? Again, all that happened was, and again, as I said on January 16, we were highly confident that we were going to have another $0.05 of EPS, highly confident. End of the quarter, phone calls up, \"Hey, sorry, can you delay this thing a week, and the delivery a week?\" And, that\\'s it. You\\'re done. Secondly, with the late orders, the team did a great job of actually turning the orders, get them out the door, but you can\\'t recognize the revenue because you haven\\'t gotten the invoice. And it is as simple as that, I mean we are incredibly disappointed. And the team did a great job in the last week trying to scramble around, but I mean, unfortunately things happen. In the course of history, in the last 4 quarters, that $35 million rolled into Q2, right? $0.05 rolls into Q2. So again, if you look at the last 4 quarters, aggregate, we have been above the midpoint and have executed fine. Unfortunately, right now we are seeing the highest volatility, quite frankly, that I\\'ve seen since we created Agilent, outside of the 2001, 2009 downturn. This is Bryan Kip  on behalf of Paul. You guys alluded to some cost synergies that are still going on at Varian. Can you, just jump into that a little bit further? Are you still seeing margin improvement or benefits from the Varian acquisition? Absolutely. Bill mentioned that -- or I did, also in my script. There\\'s -- we\\'re going to deliver $50 million of incremental cost synergies and Varian is a chunk of that. I would say about half of that is the from the Varian, and we have another year to go before we accomplish our goal in terms of delivering $100 million of cost synergies for Varian. And the rest are other cost synergies that will be delivered by the new Agilent or the fulfillment organization, and which will cover both logistics, manufacturing rationalization and material savings. And just one more follow-up. You guys mentioned some headwinds on the currency side in Asia, specifically in Japan. But how is that region helping or hurting total margins? Well in -- well certainly, in general, I mean, our margins -- our prices are about the same in whatever regions where we operate. So you could say that the margins on the regions where operating expenses might be -- are lower, is better, obviously, operating margin level. If that answer your question, I\\'m not sure exactly. If that addresses your question or not, with the...? Yes, I guess just -- are your margins in your Asia Pacific region, are they above the company average, the 17, slightly north of 17 this quarter. Are you guys seeing some headwinds there, or...? Gross margins are about the same, and usually, as you can imagine, the CL selling  costs are lower in some of those regions, than they are in the high-cost  and Ron would like to add. The biggest issue that affects our margins is our mix. So when we look at some of the products that are sent to China for manufacturing, that has a different margin structure than some other project -- other products. But for the exact same products, our margins hold up very well. Did you ever, Bill, say what was embedded in guidance for the growth in the core business? I know, previously you\\'d said minus 1.5% to 1.5%. Can you just be clear on what\\'s embedded for core growth? So by business, if I look at the high-end of the guidance where the core growth is about flat for Agilent, it will be in your 4% to 5% reduction in the EMG; 3% to 4% increase in CAG; 4% to 5% increase in LSG; and DGG -- and again, we\\'re talking organic growth, and currency adjusted DGG would be at 10%. So that\\'s with the whole thing, that gets us to the 0 percent, which is, corresponds to the high-end of our guidance at $7.1 billion on the currency-adjusted and organic basis. And then are you able to comment at all on the China book-to-bill and just kind of latest trends there. I know you talk qualitatively about it a minute ago, but...? Well, the China business, again, clearly compounded with the projected slowdown in Communications, plus the push out of deliveries, overall China was relatively flat just because the result of that. The Chemical Analysis business essentially was in the very low-single digits. The Life Science business though, had a substantial growth in the quarter, exceeding 20%. Okay. And then are you able to talk on pricing, I know you had a couple of comments on competitive dynamics earlier, but can you talk about whether pricing trends may have impacted margins? We had said that at the beginning of the year that we had -- we\\'re going to target our manufacturing cost savings to offset pricing. This quarter, Didier did say the number that we thought that we could get $40 million of gross margins out, and actually make a contribution. So to date, even though there\\'s obviously, point deals where there\\'s margin pressure, the fundamental discounts have not -- have gotten a little bit weaker, but have not changed substantially. And I guess on that margin comment, I mean margins are always back-end loaded in the year. But if we look at the guidance you\\'ve laid out, I mean you need to average I think about $0.77 in the back half of the year to hit guidance of $0.67 next quarter. That\\'s a little bit of a bigger step up than we\\'ve seen before, and is that just the function of the additional cost workouts? Actually the slope isn\\'t much different than \\'12, given how we started off so slowly in Q1. It\\'s actually, the seasonality is not that different than \\'12. Part of it is the top line. It\\'s operating leverage, because we are seeing what we\\'re hearing what you guys are hearing also, which is the, that the economy will slowly, slowly grow again. And so that is embedded in our guidance. And part of it is just the cost synergies. But the cost synergies, I would say, I mean, are fairly well balanced throughout the remainder of the year. And last one, if the communications market is really kind of slowing here, does this change the secular growth rate of the company across the cycle? Don\\'t read anything more than what we said. Q1 was slower, as anticipated. Given the volatility that we have in the push outs, we are saying that we are planning for a -- the potential for slower Communication. That\\'s it. And it\\'s one view of many. You will have some people saying it\\'s going to be up in the right forever. Some people will say hey it\\'s going to be slowing down because of the investment at this point in time. All what we\\'re saying is that is what our plan is, built into our guidance. And that\\'s our view at this point in time. And if we\\'re wrong, we will capitalize on the upside and if, in fact, it\\'s worse than that, then we\\'ll make the corresponding adjustments. Can you just talk a little bit, the Genomics and Diagnostics business was up 6% on the core growth. The number -- a little bigger number than we were thinking before. It\\'s like, what\\'s sort of driving then? Can you also give us like an update on Dako and where you\\'re starting the product portfolio launch, and how you\\'re seeing -- are you getting -- what\\'s your traction getting right now from SureFISH? All right, I will -- I\\'m going to turn this over to Lars in a second, but I could not be more pleased with the progress that we have been making with Dako, in terms of the integration into a large company without distracting them. And again, hopefully Lars can validate -- or verify that. And then secondly, as you know, Lars has taken over responsibility for all of our Genomics business, as well as our Pathology business to really drive leverage and the -- that integration, on top of that, is going well. So Lars, why don\\'t you go ahead and talk about a little bit about how you see the -- your core Dako business and the opportunity in the new group? Sure. Let me -- take a crack at that. No, I basically agree with that. It\\'s a -- it\\'s been a great journey so far, coming into the Agilent family and we are allowed to do the right things here, which I think is very important. I think we are holding the line with Dako pretty nicely here. So if you look back the last couple of quarters, we\\'ve been able to stabilize our business at the core Pathology level at around 5% organic growth rate. And then -- and relative to the market, Dako is doing better. But it\\'s fair to state, still, that we are not yet up to the speed of the market. We hope that, that traction will change in the course of the next, probably 2 quarters as we will be moving in an unprecedented number on new products that is right now hitting. That\\'s anything from new chemistries to new instrumentation. So basically, we\\'re going to go to market in the next few months with a very broad and diverse portfolio. More specifically, what we believe is going to drive the uptake here on the core Dako business is fundamentally a new, fully automated instrument. And I\\'ve said before that we  foresee a long summer in the midst of 2013, and to characterize that even further, I can say that we are into customer sites right now. And we have run a fairly significant number of both immunities to chemistry at these slides, and the results so far as measured by a group of pathologists is really spectacular. We haven\\'t released the spec of what we\\'re going come with, at this point in time. We will be doing so in the course of the next 4 weeks. But the internal benchmarking that we have would indicate that is going to be a very, very high performing instrument. So stay tuned. There\\'s going to be more information coming out of that. We will be expanding our clinical sites towards the, call it, the second calendar quarter of the year, and I expect us to be into a full swing launch somewhere in the third calendar quarter. So we see this as a terrific upside to build on the strength that we have been able to stabilize with the Dako business. So things are looking good. To break it down per geography, if we look at our core Dako performance, we are probably growing the last quarter in the North American or the U.S., so the Americas business, by around 6%. We are pretty flat in Europe. And the Asia Pacific business, inclusive of Japan, is up around 15%. To breakout the few of the things where we see major traction would be China, where we are growing more than 100%, as an example. So the things are picking up and we are able to leverage the infrastructure from Agilent, and also the incremental investments in field resources that we have put in place. In terms of the Genomics business, I\\'m pleased to say that we\\'ve been able to substantially improve the profitability of the business during the last 12 months. The team has done a great job, actually reducing cost, and actually improving the margins here. We see a good traction with the CGH microarray business getting into the clinic, and we expect that, that penetration will continue, and we\\'re going to benefit from that. That\\'s a very important line for us. So a number of the other Consumables and instrumentations are doing very well and we are pleased to see the progress. And compared to the industry benchmark, I\\'m pleased to say that we are at the level where the industry has been performing in the last 2 quarters. Specifically around the SureFISH, we are having a customer base of, I would characterize that around 150, 270 customers a day actively reordering. The reordering rate is not at the level where I would be pleased right now. So we have made a footprint, but we haven\\'t penetrated to the ability or the potential of the company right now. A few things that we are finding out is the time to validate the new probes get into the accounts takes about a longer time, and we also need to ensure that the we optimize the SureFISH on FFPE on the tissue, all right? And we\\'re going to automate that on top of it. So there are 3 things that\\'s going to happen here the next few months. We\\'re going to have more probes out. Addressing some of the solid tumors. We\\'re going to optimize this on tissue so it can be carried by the Dako sales force and we\\'re also going to automate that on the new instrument that\\'s going to hit in the next, call it, couple of months here. So we are making good progress. We are gaining incremental business, competitive reinstall  business, but not yet up to the potential. And I promise you that\\'s going to be a very important area and a significant growth opportunity for us. Could you walk us through the components of the revenue guidance reduction? You missed the midpoint of revenue guidance by $10 million. You said you would have been, I think, $10 million to $20 million higher if weren\\'t the delays. Recognizing FX has become less of a headwind, you obviously lowered full year revenue guidance by a lot more, $100 million, I believe, at the midpoint. How much of this is Defense? How much of it is Communications, and how much of this is largely other things or maybe just giving yourself a little bit more wiggle room, given the choppy execution over the last several quarters? $100 million for the year, from $7.2 billion to $7.1 billion, $35 million currency, and just split the difference on Defense versus Communication, moving forward. And I think that your comment of trying not have another quarter like this is legitimate. Okay. And I guess I\\'m a little -- it\\'s a little surprising, at least to me, that a key component you\\'re highlighting of having to reduce your revenue guidance is attributable to sequestration, given I think you\\'d agree, how pessimistic you\\'ve been regarding developments or lack thereof in Washington. What exactly were you expecting before for Defense? And how did Defense hold up in January? We\\'ve seen some data, such as the fact that DoD contract awards declined, I think, 42% year-over-year in the month. So is that was something that you called out as being an incremental headwind in the quarter. I\\'m just wondering if you saw anything over the last few weeks? Well, it\\'s interesting. I\\'ll let Guy talk about the U.S. Our Defense business in the quarter was actually up 9%, all driven by non-U.S. purchases. But I\\'ll have -- so again, an anomaly now, but the -- I\\'ll have Guy comment about exactly what they\\'re seeing between the government and the primes. Well, yes, as you heard from Bill, our business really grew because of the international part. In the U.S., we were flat in Q1. And mostly because of the backlog we got in Q4 in orders, and also the year-end money. The budget spending for most of the defense and contractor. So flat in the U.S. and the growth comes from outside of the U.S. with a number of very interesting programs. Russia, for instance, was very strong, but also China in this regard. Going forward, I would say that the one thing that I would just add to the sequestration is the overall continuing resolution that is set up. And that has  a, in fact, a more interesting lever as we really would expect that the government gets to an agreed upon budget. As soon as the budget is set up, this will allow, then, everybody to start investing and making plans going forward. So it\\'s mostly the fact that nobody knows what\\'s happening, rather than the decision of yes or no for sequestration, are we looking for final decision. But if you see award activity actually slowing down, recognizing that, that would not have translated into immediate revenue anyway, but if you\\'re seeing award revenue -- I\\'m sorry, award activity slow down recently, wouldn\\'t that suggest that if there is going to be anything that, is in line with the dynamic you just described, moving past the continuing resolution and having some certainty that it\\'s going to take a little while for that revenue to flow through? Well, that\\'s the big question. It\\'s going to take a while and we just don\\'t know how long. So, so far in the -- what we have in the guidance is we assume there is going to be a budget, and that we are, in the high-end of our guidance, that we will see some orders coming in, mostly at the end of the year. Okay. And last question, could you just talk about the impact of the Lunar New Year being a little bit later than it was last year? How did that play out in January, and how is that being reflected in Q2 guidance? Lunar New Year, again, because of our quarter from October to January, every 4 years, Lunar New Year is in the same as Christmas holidays, which is always a problem for us. Because the Lunar New Year, this year, in fact, is going on right now, at the very beginning of the quarter, there\\'s, we don\\'t imagine any material impact to the Lunar New Year to Q2 whatsoever. Could you comment a little bit on more the general-purpose end market, and just what\\'s your outlook there, given that we are seeing some improving macro variables? And maybe also just what are your -- what do your customers tell you when they decide to push out an order? Is this just based on, we need to make our own numbers, or is there something else going on there? Well, again, we can\\'t make a comment on push out of orders. As I alluded to, we have huge customers. And which I think adds more volatility than if we had thousands of thousands of small, $10,000, $50,000 customers. The top 25 customers average $11 million a quarter. So it doesn\\'t take much at the end. And there\\'s just a variety of reasons why they want something later or not, so I\\'ll just leave it at that, and again we never comment on an individual customer. But Guy, why don\\'t you just go ahead and give an update on what you\\'re seeing in the terms of the overall general-purpose market, and you can put a plug in the continued success of oscilloscopes. Yes, maybe I should start with this, we -- our oscilloscope program keeps our hitting very well our expectations and had another positive growth rate this quarter. And very pleased to this, probably we\\'ll give you more details when we meet in March at our meeting there. The general-purpose market is, I would say, very mixed beside the high-speed digital discussion that I just shared with you on the oscilloscope side. The rest of the market, the cost of the world was down, as you\\'ve seen our industrials for EMG, we\\'re 13% down. And it is based on the macroeconomic concerns still. The PMI is a little bit better than last quarter. But the trend is still too slow for people, really to invest, until the -- unless they have clear production needs so, and this, obviously, is not very clear in the marketplace yet. Well, a lot of my questions have already been asked and answered. But Bill, you talked about order visibility, as it\\'s been very problematic. Is it pretty much just confined to EM? Or have you also seen more volatile order patterns in the Life Science and Chemical businesses as well? The -- it\\'s still predominantly EM, given how big it is, and just the size of the customers are so large. But this quarter, we also -- and again, Mike can comment, we actually saw some unusual push outs, delays in the Chemical Analysis side as well. And so that\\'s new. But it\\'s still predominantly the Electronic Measurement part of the business. I don\\'t know, Mike you have any comments? You\\'ve got a little bit of it, too. Yes, there was actually a silver lining in that story. So Bill is exactly right, that we saw some unexpected volatility at the end of our quarter. As Bill said, he thought we had it nailed on January 16 when we talked with the board. But the good news, the silver lining is what we saw was, a lot of interest in our new launch of our franchise products, and so what we saw at the end of the quarter was, a number of our customers asked us to convert their orders and they were interested in the new products, so that was not part of the -- it occurred at a higher level than we had anticipated, and that\\'s why I said earlier, there\\'s a silver lining there. So that\\'s what we saw the end of the year quarter from the Chemical Analysis side. Yes, these are the 2 highest volume, gas-based products. It\\'s a replacement for our 70, 90 gas chromatograph, and then also our single quad DC mass spec product. Okay. And then a final question, just to confirm, so it looks like you\\'re still expecting the kind of flat to low, or maybe mid-single-digit growth in Chemical Life Sciences for the year? Just one quick question. Didier, when you look at the decremental margin in the EMG business, whether you look at it year-over-year, or you look at it sequentially from fourth to first, is there any mix impact in that decremental? Is that all volume? And should we kind of expect that going forward? Or is there, again, some of the cost take out that you alluded to, is it weighted towards EMG? EMG has, since Q1 of 2012, engaged in a very, very strict hiring freeze and cost controls and things like that. So they are in the process of accelerating those, this clamp down on expenses. But the -- really all of the -- I mean, that helps, but the impact of the loss of operating leverage, the impact of the lower revenue is really what explains all of the decremental. It is all top line because they\\'ve done a really, really good job at managing the expenses. They\\'ve really achieved the goals that we had set for them in terms of, again, incremental, decremental. And in the old days, we would not have seen EMG at that kind of revenue at over 17% operating margin. So it is certainly -- and they are in the process of doing more in terms of discretionary expenses. And Didier, could you also, I\\'m sorry, you whipped through this a little fast, but could you just repeat. Did you suggest that the EMG business now for the year, with sequestration at the midpoint, in the estimate and then also with the comps slowdown, did you suggest, maybe down mid-single-digits is a better... Yes, but that was in line with the high-end of our guidance of $7.1 billion, that EMG core revenue growth currency adjusted would be between minus 4% and minus 5%. I just want a little bit more clarity on some things. So, I\\'m -- as a molecular biologist, and life science analyst, so I\\'m a little more familiar with the other side of the business, the EM business. I appreciate some of the comments you\\'ve made on not thinking that you\\'re seeing share shifts in this business. But I\\'m just curious, it\\'s like, what other evidence out there, where -- how can we gain better confidence that you guys aren\\'t seeing some pressure, particularly in the areas like the wireless testing business. Particularly since some of your competitors like LitePoint are now part of Teradyne? It\\'s -- I\\'m just looking for some better clarity -- metrics in terms of the market share shifts in this areas, like, what can we do to get a comfort level that it, that\\'s just a slowdown in the market and not share loss? Well it\\'s very, very difficult, with the biggest competitor that we have is Rohde & Schwarz, it\\'s a German company and it\\'s private. The battle right now for the wireless handset market in R&D is between Anritsu, Rohde & Schwarz and ourselves. That is by far, the biggest players. Anritsu, of course, had a great run last year, and you can look at their numbers for the last quarter, where they had slowed down, but that\\'s the ballgame. The biggest issue is one of the largest competitors in the space is private. You can clearly get their tax returns when they file backward looking, that\\'s really where the battle is. And it\\'s no disrespect because some of the smaller companies that are playing in the space. But the communication market is $4 billion or $5 billion. You know how big we are, and that\\'s really where the action is, and our biggest competitor, point for point, is Rohde & Schwarz. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\\'s broadcast. I\\'d like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks they\\'d like to make. Yes, thank you, Regina. This is Alicia. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today on the call. And we look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day on the 7th of March. Thank you. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we\\'ll go ahead and close out. Thank you so much for your participation today. This concludes our presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter Two 2013 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Patrick, and I\\'ll be your facilitator for today.  As a reminder, to all participants this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Today, Agilent reported revenues of $1.73 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, inclusive of the Dako acquisition. Adjusted net income was $269 million or $0.77 per share. We exceeded EPS guidance despite continued industry headwinds and macroeconomic challenges. Strong Q2 earnings were driven by our ability to generate higher manufacturing margins while sequentially reducing operating expenses. These improvements demonstrated the strength of Agilent’s business model, which has enabled us to streamline our operations while supporting future growth.  We expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging through the second half of 2013. We are taking additional actions to ensure that Agilent is solidly positioned for the future success and value creation. Today, we announced that $50 million restructuring program to further streamline our operations and reduce our cost structure.  In addition, Agilent’s Board has authorized the doubling of our stock repurchase authorization from $500 million to $1 billion. The repurchase program will be executed by the end of calendar year 2013. Despite current challenges, Agilent is well positioned in our target markets. The integration and leverage of our worldwide manufacturing operation, will continue to drive higher gross margins. We have a deep pipeline of new product introductions and our commitment to customer satisfaction is second to none. Here is some of the business highlights. Agilent’s Q2 orders of $1.69 billion were down 8% over last year including Dako. Revenues of $1.73 billion were flat year-over-year. Operating margins were 19%.  With the acquisition of Dako, we will no longer refer to our life science and chemical businesses as Bio Analytical measurement or BAM. Instead, we’ll use LDA for life science diagnostics and applied chemical markets. Please note this is not an organizational change, we will continue to report life science, diagnostics and genomics, and chemical analysis as separate segments.  Revenue for LDA were $972 million in Q2 up 13% year-over-year inclusive of Dako. Operating margins was 18%. Overall pharmaceutical markets grew 8% driven by technology upgrades.  Academic and Government markets declined 5%. Food safety grew 8%, offsetting softness in the forensics and environmental markets. Petrochemical was up 3%, within LDA, the life science group revenue grew 2% year-over-year, operating margin was 15%.  Performance was led by LC, LCMS and recurring revenues. The new on core multi span liquid handling system for automation division has been well received in the marketplace. Revenues in the Diagnostics and Genomics group grew 124% down 3% organically. Operating margin was 17%. Well currency impacted our Genomics business  sales remains sales. Targeted Enrichment volumes grew even in the phase of strong competitor pricing underscoring our leading market division. Surface renewals continue at high rate as we continue expand the customer base. We continue to be pleased with the results in Dako, last quarter Dako launched its new advanced staining platform on this, which includes hardware, software and reagents. Placement to begun a key C customer sides and feedback has been excellent. Chemical analysis group revenue group revenues grew 3% year-over-year operating margin was 22%. Our recently introduced GC Q-TOF and ICP triple quad shows solid results. In addition, we introduced the new 7890B gas chromatograph, and the 5977A series single quad Mass Spec as well as a whole new release of our OpenLab chromatograph data system. Electronic Measurement group revenue declined 13% over last year, despite the lower than expected revenues, operating margin of 21% was strong. We are able to maintain gross margins and rapidly reduced expenses and response for the changing environment. Industrial demand was down 17% reflecting weak macroeconomic conditions that are expected to persist in the near-term. Computers and semiconductors also declined by double-digits reflecting the over capacity situation and the weak PC market. Aerospace and defense was flat and oversees sales offset declines in the United States. Wireless R&D was down 1% as customers continue to invest cautiously. Wireless manufacturing was down 26% due to the loss of business from a large customer as we could not agree on terms this year. This will continue to have major negative revenue impact for the rest of FY ‘13. Nevertheless, we continue to see opportunities in wireless manufacturing, we just introduced our manufacturing solution for wireless LAN. We will continue to invest in market leading wireless test solutions in both R&D and manufacturing. We’re excited with our upcoming product launches for the second half of the year.  We’re also in the midst of two significant transformations related to module and handset instruments, while we continue to make invests and bring new products to market. We’re seeing continued double-digit growth year-to-date in our AXI and PXI module platforms. And in our microwaves FieldFox handheld has been well received by the customers. As I indicted, we’re forecasting a weak Q3 due to lower revenue from our wireless manufacturing business and a challenging macro environment for electronic measurement.  In summary, here are the additional actions we’re taking to leverage our integrated and variable business model and to increase Agilent’s financial performance. We will maintain the expense control that we have placed since Q2. These controls enable us to expand margin and exceed EPS even in the phase of lower revenues. As part of the $50 million restructuring I mentioned earlier we will reduce Agilent’s overall workforce by an additional 2% or 450 employees. This is on top of the manufacturing restructure that is already been initiated.  Finally, we will increase our stock repurchase program by $500 million to $1 billion to be completed within the calendar year. We now expect FY‘13 revenues at $6.75 to $6.85 billion which is at the low end of our previous guidance. We expect FY’13 adjusted EPS of $2.70 to $2.85. Our ongoing expense controls, restructuring, and additional stock repurchase programs announced today are expected to absorb most of the impact of the lower revenue on our EPS. While we face a tough operating environment, we\\'re executing the right strategy for Agilent to benefit from a market recovery when it occurs. We have built a strong foundation for growth by safeguarding our profitability while capitalizing on opportunities for the future. We believe this strategy will enable Agilent to build and sustain shareholder value. Thank you for being on the call.  Thank you Bill and hello everyone. As we have stated the low end of our revenue guidance assumed that the sequester would take effect on March 1. Our Q2 revenues were $8 million below the low end of our guidance, a difference that was entirely due to the $12 million negative impact from currency exchanges. Q2 EPS on the other hand were $0.07 above the high end of our guidance as we executed on our commitment to significantly curtail discretionary expenses as long as the economic environment remains highly uncertain. To recap the quarter, co-orders which exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions were down 12% year-over-year while core revenues decreased 4%.  However our operating margin at 19.3% was on par with last year\\'s 19.5%. By segment, EMG core revenues 12% year-over-year, CAG was up 5%, LSG was up, and DDG was flat year-over-year.  By region, core revenues were down in the Americas by 7%, Europe by 2% and Japan by 7% and flat for the rest of Asia Pacific. Our strong 19.3% overall operating margin, 20.5% for EMG and 18.3% for LDA, demonstrates that we have come a long way since 2009 when we also experienced tough economic conditions that severely impacted EMG and to a lesser extent LDA. Back then, our overall operating margin was about 7% even after the temporary 10% pay cut. Clearly the actions we have taken to reduce our fixed cost structure, leverage the scale and integration of Agilent order fulfillment and global and infrastructural organizations, as well as our acquisition strategy have paid off nicely. We did not eliminate EMG\\'s sensitivity to the macroeconomic environment, nor the lumpiness of some markets, but we did reduce significantly the bottom line volatility. Regarding cash, we generated $315 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. We bought back 3.3 million shares for $140 million and have a net cash position of $225 million. Now turning to the guidance for the full year. The low end of the revenue guidance provided last February, which again assumed the sequester would be effective March 1 was $6.9 billion. Since then currency changes have had a negative impact of $50 million versus the last guidance. In addition, there is no sign yet of a macroeconomic recovery and PMI indices are stuck around 50. We are now expecting fiscal year \\'13 revenues to range from $6.75 billion to $6.85 billion, a 1% reported year-over-year decrease at the midpoint, which translates into a 3% core revenue decrease, reflecting the loss of the wireless manufacturing business Bill talked about.  On the cost front, our global order fulfillment organization is on track to generate about $50 million of savings, and our control of discretionary expenses will be maintained in the foreseeable future. Those actions, coupled with the benefit of the incremental $500 million stock buyback will offset most of the impact of lower revenue projections and currency headwinds on our EPS, which is expected to range from $2.70 to $2.85. Finally, moving to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion. At the midpoint, reported revenue would be down about 5% versus last year with EMG down about 19% and LDA up about 10% including Dako and up 5% excluding Dako.  Excluding the impact of the wireless manufacturing business lost, EMG would be down about 8%, reflecting the sequester, and the ongoing challenging micro economic situation. We will continue clumping down on discretionary spend and we will start seeing the first savings from the additional restructuring program in the third quarter. We expect Q3 EPS of $0.60 to $0.64.  Thanks very much. Bill, on the wireless manufacturing customer, again, is it single customer? I assume it’s a contract and did the contract come to fruition only recently or after the Analyst Meeting? And I guess, thirdly, can you give us any additional details around or is there any additional negotiations that could occur, are you assuming that this is just totally lost effectively throughout at the end of the year, and if you decide to do this again next year, you are not even banking on that? And I’m trying to understand what happens with other customers that know that this occurred with this single customer? Thanks very much. First of all, when we used to say negotiation has been going on for long period of time, Agilent’s not at liberty to share specific terms of the agreement, but I can say that the terms exposed to Agilent to significant penalties under certain conditions that we were not confident we could prevent without jeopardizing our ability on our commitments to other customers. Effectively, committing to one customer at the expense of other customers is not consistent with our policies and practices. And so, it’s very clear, very specific opportunity and right now, assuming that it will not come back. So, I bet obviously this is large . So this is $215 million a year, isn’t my calculating that about right, as far as the size of this? We, of course, don’t talk specifically related to individual customers at all, but it can be assumed that our one-box-tester related to wireless manufacturing test will be down $230 million year-over-year. The quarterly impact in Q3 to EMG is 75% of its decline in Q4, 72% of its decline is related to the drop of one-box-tester business for wireless manufacturing. Okay. I’m kind of curious. It’s hard to see how they could put you in box, but this is a pretty big order. I’m not sure there are many other people who could deliver something like that. So, can you help us understand a little bit more how you lost leverage here? Was another competitor that just really swooped in and really brought it to a hit? As I said, we could not accept the significant penalties under certain conditions. Typically, these are always around guarantee of supply. If in fact there’s a supply interruption and Agilent, as I said, is not consistent with its policies or practices to commit to one customer at the expense of others. Okay. So, in the second quarter then, April quarter, you guided impact through 3Q. How much is there impact in 2Q and a little more discussion about what’s happening in, say, the industrial spaces or any signs of life here in May? So, I will answer the question regarding our one-box tester business was affected EMG’s year-over-year revenue impact by 31% of the decline.  Yeah, this is Guy. So, clearly, as you probably have seen in our report, our industrial computer and semiconductor business declined 13% in Q2. On the computer and semiconductor we declined 18%, clear on the continuing weakness of the semiconductor business saw capacity slow, and there is also a pause in the technology that we have been benefited from in the past.  On the other side, also as Bill said in his remarks, the computer business is in a transition between PC and tablets and this has slowed down quite some investments in test and measurement. So, for now I would say ICS segment is probably still going to be in a low for the rest of the fiscal year and this is what we had planned for. So, right now what you say that a lot of the PC manufacturing are just swapping the test and instruments over to the tablet manufacturing without forecasting anything? Well, it\\'s not as clear. Our tablets require different type of products for test and in fact require less products for test. So there is a transition not only on the manufacturing side but also between the different companies that do them. And as you remember we also provide a lot of test equipment for the PC board manufacturers, the board stuffing verification or as we call it board test, which of course is always dominated by these big consumer products. Okay thanks for the question of. So Bill looks like obviously, a tough environment you’re now finally making decision to restructure the business a little bit more aggressively and stepping in on the buyback which I think are encouraging steps, but can you maybe give a little bit more detail around where the restructuring is taking place, any specific businesses or geographies? So in regards to the restructuring, we are going to take the opportunity to look for opportunities to streamline our organization around the world, but needless to say the biggest impact of the restructuring will be in our Electronic Measurement Group given the drop in revenue and the likelihood of it not recurring.  We have not made any statements at all in terms of where the restructuring is happening around the world, but… Okay. And then, Bill if I think now for the last couple of quarters, obviously you’ve maintained a phenomenal margin, given the tough top line, it looks like is that model out, kind of your guidance for the rest of the year, that you’re expecting a fairly substantial decline in the operating margin despite some of these initiatives that you highlighted, so would you mind just kind of breaking out, I guess your revenue and margin expectations for the different business units for the back half of the year? Yeah, I can talk about for the full year. At the midpoint of the guidance, on the call basis, we would have EMG at about 11% year-over-year decline, core revenue declined year-over-year at the midpoint of the guidance for the full year, CAG at about 3% to 4% revenue increase, LSG 3% to 4% revenue increase, DGG about 10% revenue increase for the full year, if I take LSG together it’s about 4% to 5% and that would correspond to Agilent at minus 3%. And regarding the operating margin, at midpoints we’re getting to an operating margin of slightly over 18%. So it is no, I’m looking at, it is versus in Q2 and in Q1 we had 17.2%, in Q2 19.3%. So it’s about staying at around the same levels for the rest of the year at midpoint. The impact of being in Q3 and then our typical recovery into Q4, and to the point, the average will be actually roughly what it is in the first half. That’s helpful guys. It looks like Q3, it’s a significant step down. Q4, it comes back up as it does historically, but maybe just as a group given the initiatives on the gross margin side on the LGA side, just any insight in terms of what you expect for EMG margins in the second half versus the LGA margins. Yeah, I mean, for the full year EMG margin would still be north of 18% at midpoint and then all the other one, I mean, again CHG north of close to 22% and LSG over 15% and DGG close to 14%. The same situation for Q3 and CHG for the short-term is going to be impacted but again very, very respectable and then we will have a strong recovery in Q4 and EXT-C wireless manufacturing business, EMG effectively is going to be flat sequentially from Q2 as they move into a lot easier comparison so there is any consolation to our situation Guy and the team have easier comparison moving forward.  Okay, that’s all. I’d like to speak one last, and Bill on Dako you both are the two major competitors that I’ve talked about actually some pretty tough business on the advanced training side. I think partly driven by the fact that the guidelines are no longer requiring negative controls there. So I don’t know just any, can you just let us know how Dako did relative to expectation. Thanks. Sure, Lars, why don’t you go ahead and talk about the organic growth rate from Dako and again, I mentioned one tough year-over-year comparison now being a US company.  Sure, it’s true that in the last two quarters we’ve seen the overall market growth rate being slight to nearly 10%, I would probably say that the last two quarters have been around 6% to 7% growth rate overall. So indeed the market has come down and that\\'s mainly driven from the fact that you have some changes call it in the legislation or the recommendation in the US. We do think that that is going to pan out, so we probably will have to bleed through another two quarters until we are into an annualized impact of that where the market again is going to kick up, so also it’s true that the market has been somewhat slower in the last two quarters.  Now back to the question around Dako, how is Dako doing well. Look at the performance currency adjusted Dako grew this quarter at 4%. If we in all fairness look at the real compared to prior year and we exclude some of the sale that Dako made to  those countries that didn’t recur as we pick this year, Dako was actually up to 6%. So fact we actually tell you that Dako is improving in its performance and the market seems to be at least temporarily and now taking down. So, if I compare to the two companies that was out reporting as before us, it’s probably fair to say that our coproduce time was pretty respective. Thanks for taking the call. Bill and Didier, so maybe you can comment on the buyback, the additional $500 million. I think it should be well received just, is this cash on-shore or just something that you had to do it kind of get it on-shore to access, and secondarily, what kind of elected the decision now to kind of step up the buyback, given, I think you have been kind of reluctant to do so given the inability there excess of cash? Thanks. So, I’ll take the first question. So, it will be a mix of cash on our balance sheet and some debt, the funding of the incremental $500 million. And as many of you know, we have to go back to the market this quarter to refinance $250 million tranche of coming debt. We will do that. We will take debt to pay for the restructuring and we will bring on additional debt along with repatriation of cash during the course of the year to meet this commitment of additional $500 million of stock repurchase. And then, was this anything that relates to your view of kind of the world now, in terms of where the stock price is today and the expectation of what the outlook is, or is it just a decision that, because I thought in the past you weren’t willing to kind of take on debt to buy back stock. So I’m just wondering what was kind of the trigger to see you guys step up and implement this more aggressive stock buyback plan? Well, first of all, I think that the management team with the Board’s support, having bought back $9.5 billion of the stock since 2005 as well as instituting a dividend, in fact has been very aggressive of returning cash to the shareholder. The issue is always about what the right balance is in terms of our debt load, cash generation and the macro environment. We are still quite confident. Even though we’re disappointed that the second half is not going to recover as strongly as we expected, we’re still looking for continued growth into 2014. As Didier said, our cash generation continues to be very, very robust. We have an opportunity to refinance anyway, and so to be able to easily afford without having any major impact on what the future of the Company or overall credit rating, the announcement of the additional $500 million seems quite prudent. Great. And then maybe you kind of touched upon just now in that answer Bill, but, I know probably last call, you had indicated that despite the end of quarter shortfall that you were pretty constructive about the opportunity in 2013 and hence you didn’t want to cut too deeply. So, just maybe as an update like how you’re viewing the world today, and maybe you can just give kind of an updated view of what you’re seeing from kind of the global economy and how you’re positioned for the remainder of the year. As you know, I’ve been one of the more negative CEOs in terms of growth prospects in the U.S. and Europe. I must admit I had a moment, particularly on the Analyst Day that I actually thought there was some likelihood of a recovery in the second half of the year and it’s just the hard reality. It’s not happening. The continued issues in the U.S. and Europe, Japan stimulus hasn’t kicked in. China is going to grow at 7.5% to 8%. We are not going to get the type of revenue growth that is going to be able to maintain our margins. I was very clear on the Analyst Day is that we know what it takes to do to be able to drive increasing margins and given that the likelihood of our business, not growing into our operating model. Again, the 4% organic growth rate, as a company, we are taking the appropriate actions moving forward and we will execute that as efficiently and quickly as we can. Bill, in terms of the formal guidance reduction, I’m curious if there was anything that really changed in the macro environment beyond the one discrete customer loss and then how would you characterize your ability to do more on the cost front and restructuring side if the second half doesn’t pan out as expected? So, on first question, as Didier said, in terms of the guidance, half of it is strictly currency. Again, as you know, for example, have a large amount business inside of Japan. The other part of the business is tied to our Electronic Measurement that Guy talked about. Industrial is not coming back and we have continued pressure on the computer and semiconductor. And particularly, in some of our semiconductor cap lines we’re the only supplier. So, this has nothing to do with market share or anything. It’s just a tough environment moving forward. We try to balance the long-term growth prospects of the Company versus the short-term operating needs and we’ll continue to evaluate that. I believe as difficult it is as to lay off 450 people, we are highly confident that that will not have an impact on our long-term growth opportunities, have a major impact at all to our new product introduction, our ability to expand in emerging markets. We, at this point in time, do not see a scenario where you’re going to have to see a additional dramatic decrease of revenue unless there was some sort of new economic crisis. And let me just add one clarification regarding the loss of this wireless business, the wireless manufacturing business. I mean, that was already taken out from our guidance in February or in March at the Analyst Meeting. This is not a new element. The reason why we are talking about it now it’s on a year-over-year basis, it does explain both, especially for Q2 and Q3 and a little bit for Q4 some of the significant reported or projected reduction in revenue for EMG. Versus what I had communicated, I think sometime in November in fact where I had said that our operating cash flow would be about $1.25 million and about $220 million in CapEx. We’re now down more to $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, little bit over that between $1.1 billion and $1.15 billion and still the same level of CapEx. So basically the reduction is both the restructuring program and the reduced profits versus what we have said in November. So it’s about a reduction of about $100 million, still over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Good afternoon. I guess a multi-part question for I guess Guy or Bill, is, within this lost wireless manufacturing business and outside of kind of the guarantee supply issue that you previously discussed, Bill, was pricing a major impact to the contract negotiation with this large customer? Was this business won by traditional competitor or one of the newer entrants into wireless test, and was this business margin dilutive relative to the EMG average? Yeah, we\\'re not going to go into the details of specific deal, other than the fact that we are very, very competitive in this space. We have some of the highest gross margins in the industry as the business unit is moving forward. And we have said very, very clearly, the issue is related to terms. Okay. And then I guess, Guy, on the communications front, are you still seeing better infrastructure trends relative to your, obviously, the handset manufacturing but to the R&D test? And then can you comment on some of the geographic trends within infrastructure, and then thoughts, perhaps, any thoughts you might have on timing of China Mobile investments? Yeah, on the infrastructure side, especially the base station, we have not seen major shift and changes happening yet in Q2. We won a couple of deals in China around TD-LTE that could be a premise of what\\'s happening going forward. But it\\'s really very early and everybody is waiting for China Mobile to do really the request for proposal for the base station suppliers. So we don\\'t know yet who is going to get this business and when, so it\\'s very difficult to predict frankly as we are waiting on this one for a number of quarters now.  Okay. And then I guess Bill, I am sorry if I missed this, you might have already commented on this but I think within guidance you\\'d previously said that, from a revenue perspective you are anticipating a 10% impact to your defense business because of sequestration and in worst case of 20%. Is that still how we are looking at it? Any update there post some details you guys picked up on March 1st? Yeah, again I think the guideline is fine. I will let Guy make a comment because the U.S. defense business was not great, but we had no outstanding performance in Europe and Japan. So Guy, why don’t you give us the latest update on the overall defense business… Yeah, the overall defense business in fact we finished flat versus last year in terms of revenue and mostly driven by the business outside of the U.S. So clearly places in Europe like Russia are very strong in satellite and other defense investments and this is helping. As I said, I think I commented at our  surveillance is another business that is going very well and we won large deals in Japan for instance that helped.  On the other side in the U.S. it is clearly as we were expecting, even a little bit lower. The DoD orders were 50% even more than 50% down compared to what we had last year. I would also comment that the sequestration to the U.S. has a broader effect on the wider, smaller companies that we probably have classified more into industrial as everybody is waiting a little bit to understand what\\'s happening in the defense business. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to revisit the capital allocation question. I do think that increased buyback here was a positive step, but I was hoping maybe you can give your shareholders a little more visibility on the longer term value creation process on the context of this growth environment certainly think that under or at least appreciate the operating environments are challenging, but it would be helpful if you can talk a little bit more about how you are thinking about use of cash for the longer-term? Our position on the use of cash has not changed at all. Our first priority is to continue to look for acquisitions that help drive our overall growth instituted to the Company. The bulk of the $4.5 billion of investment we have made in acquisitions since 2005 have been in the healthcare area. And as you know, in Life Sciences and Chemical and Diagnostics and in 2005 our Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis business was $1.5 billion and this year we’re on the verge of getting to $4 billion, and $1.5 billion of that revenue is through acquisition. So, we will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our growth in this part of our business, the LDA part of our business. Secondly, is our obligation to return excess cash to the shareholders. We have clearly demonstrated that over the last eight and a half years, both through stock repurchase and this year a 20% increase in dividend, and we will continue to look at ways to tax effectively bring cash back into the U.S. We’ll continue to be able to look at our debt capacity and ensure that we make the trade-offs not only for the short-term opportunity, but for the long-term health of the Company. That’s very helpful. And then maybe just on the first time you mentioned regarding M&A in Diagnostics, you obviously have a start there with Dako, but seems to me that most of the competitors you have in that space have a broader range of offerings there, and my thought is that the asset prices there tend to be pretty rich relative to your ROIC hurdles. So I guess, the question is, have you guys seen any abatement in the price tags for the assets you’d want to bold on to Dako? No. Well, we haven’t. Again, we’re a conservative company. We feel very fortunate that we were able to acquire Dako and not have the deal jumped. It’s a very competitive environment and we have chosen not to participate in these competitive decisions moving forward. I do believe that the culmination of our Genomics business and our Pathology business is the right fit and we need to continue to look for holes in our portfolio in this space that we have. And maybe Lars, maybe you could talk a little bit, now that you’re managing both parts of the business for the last few quarters, your thoughts of the synergy between the Genomics business and your Pathology business and how you look at the environment for potential acquisitions. Sure Bill. So, obviously a little rough to come out and take a shot at potential acquisition and targets here, but somewhat around the thinking here, I mean, two things are coming to play here. Clearly technologies from our Genomics Solutions Division is going to find its way into the Clinical Lab channel, covered by the Dako folks. So, basically we’ll see kind of more of a validated regulated play from the organization for the array business. We hope that we will be plugging some of the holes in our sequencing offering. I mean, we have a great basically HaloPlex offerings or select offering. We are looking at how we can complement that with let’s say other tools at this point in time and we are deeply diving into the opportunities in that market that we see here. And clearly, the Dako channel is going to be able to leverage what comes out of the GST organization and we’re going to play that partially into cyto labs, but obviously into the core channel that we have in the core pathology area. That’s going to happen. We have a fairly, call it, exhausted list of opportunities that we are looking into. A path will be passed at this point in time on the key areas and potential targets that we are looking at. But I would expect that in the next couple of months, maybe even the next year or so that you’ll see the organization DGG being fairly active in a few areas, let\\'s put it this way at this stage. Thanks. Didier, can you just help me bridge the midpoint of your earnings guidance change. You had about $0.08 difference between your current and your previous guidance. Can you just help breakdown the parts there? Yeah, let me take a shot at it. So at midpoint, there\\'s $200 million reduction in the top line and that would translate to about $140 million reduction in gross margin. And then we have various cuts in discretionary expenses. We have the restructuring savings. All in all, as Bill and I mentioned, I mean, those savings offset a big chunk, most of the impact of the lower revenue. So, on an operating profit basis, it\\'s about $40 million reduction instead of starting from $140 million to about $40 million, and that would about translate into $0.10 of EPS deterioration and then the impact of the buyback is about $0.03. So a $0.02 to $0.03, so you get to the $0.08 that you mentioned. And then the second part, I want to make sure I heard this right, you said the $200 million in revenue reduction, none of that is due to this, the manufacturing customer loss, you said you already included that in the previous guidance. Yeah, absolutely, very little, there was some, I always hope that the upside, that perhaps we will get something. But most of the reduction doesn\\'t come from February to the May guidance doesn\\'t come from that lost business. Again this lost business has a bigger, has big explanation of the year-over-year variance but not in the change in the guidance. I just need to sneak one more in. Can you just talk about pharma, biotech and academic government performance in April and kind of just the cadence through the quarter of those two segments? Thanks. Yeah, so we\\'re seeing some continued strength in pharma. In fact there\\'s been an upward momentum across the quarter. So it was really strong. In fact, in the U.S., it was fairly strong with a lot of investment going into new sites for biotech R&D in the pharma sector. Academic government, it is very weak and a lot of that weakness is the U.S. sequestration and the offshore impact. As you know, there is connected grant giving between U.S. government and other governments. So the academic government as we told you, was down about 5%. If you looked at the macro for LSG, that represented about a half a point drag on us in the quarter. So that\\'s kind of our view. Bill, obviously, last quarter you were a bit frustrated by the lack of visibility that you were being afforded. Would you say that visibility has gotten worse at this point or in light of the way that the quarter has unfolded, it is pretty much the same as it was in February? Excellent question, and I’m going to have Ron answer the question because that has been one of the more frustrating areas in trying to predict where our ultimate earnings are going, and even in this quarter, as you know, our earnings were well above the midpoint of our guidance through heroic efforts of Ron and the team. So, Ron, why don\\'t you share some of your findings on causes of unpredictability and what we\\'re trying to do to manage through it? The biggest challenge that leads to the unpredictability is the last $20 million to $40 million worth of revenue that we\\'re trying to ship and get through and have customers accepts before the end of the quarter. So what we\\'ve seen is a continual delay or people dragging their feet by making the final purchases and actually getting the approvals through. Then we have to go ahead and ship the product, get it installed and make sure that it gets signed off. And the last week or two of the quarter is where the whole ballgame has been won or lost. We saw this in Q3, and in Q1 it was also pretty tough. But again, it\\'s very hard to predict, it all depends on when the customers need the orders at the end of the quarter, and that has tended to move revenue over the quarter boundary. But we\\'re working very hard at trying to understand what the customer needs are, trying to be a little bit more conservative in what we project and as you saw in the last quarter we pulled all the stops out on expenses and that caused us to be at $0.77 over the top.  Our guidance methodology has not changed. The high end of our guidance is our best view of what will happen. The lower end of the guidance is our guess forecast of what is the likely volatility due to the issues that Ron just described. Okay. And then maybe just to go back to 1Q, you were able to recognize all the revenues that that got pushed off in the last week of the quarter? Okay. And then maybe on the CAG side, growth in petrochem was a little bit better than I would have thought just given the industrials commentary from some of your peers. Is that really a function of the new GC introductions? I guess what is your outlook for the market growth in those areas for the next couple of quarters? Sure, Bill. I think the slight recovery you saw in the chemical end of the space is really driven by the emerging markets in Asia. I don’t think it points to an overall fundamental strong recovery yet in the global market space. Although the new product that Bill referred to earlier launched in Q2 or shipped in Q2 did have an impact, but I think I would really point to the geographic strength in China and other emerging economies. Hi, this is actually Brian Kipp on behalf of Paul. Can you guys discuss, I guess you saw some strength in Japan on the aerospace side, but with the bad currency translation, I just wanted to kind of hear you what you guys were thinking, what you saw in the quarter coming out of Japan and what kind of impact it had. And then just for your 2013 guidance what the spot rate you guys have on the FX translation for the… Didier, why don’t you give the overview on Japan and Holland, and Bryan if you have any follow-up questions by product line? Yeah so, in terms of how we guide in regards to currency, there has been no change in our process, in our methodology. We take the spot rate as of the last day of the previous quarter and we assume that will be the rate for the rest of the remainder of the year. We are hedged as you know overall on the 100% for the first quarter and then on a declining basis over three to four quarters. We are also have in general well pretty structurally hedged also having a huge footprint in the most of the regions.  However, clearly in Japan we have less cost than we have revenues in yen and therefore like other companies we will, our operating margin will be impacted by the weakening of the yen. But because of our hedge that impact is not felt yet completely in the present quarters and will be felt over time. And then regarding Japan, let me give you the numbers, so overall, we saw Japan down on a GAAP basis about 14%, but then when you take into account, that is on the reported basis, but on the core basis it\\'s down 7%. Okay, thank you. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you guys did a great job on pulling through some of these cost controls in the quarter, and just kind of wanted to get a more color on there. I remember during the Analyst Day, you said there was about seven sites that continue or continue to be in process of consolidation, have those been consolidated for your guidance for the $50 million in incremental cost savings? Are those all in there or are those more outer years in 2014 and 2015, and if so if you guys can, can you pull some of those forward to recognize some additional cost savings in \\'13? All right, I will have Ron answer the questions regarding the $50 million of manufacturing cost savings. Again that was previously announced moving forward for the status update. The $50 million that we announced today are all out of our expense structure and are in addition to the $50 million that were related to manufacturing and the sites that you referred to. So, Ron, why don\\'t you give an update again on our manufacturing and consolidation? Our manufacturing and restructuring program is right on track. We have a multiyear program that we\\'ve talked about at Analyst Day that adds up to, close to $200 million and we\\'re about one-third of the way through that and we are on track to deliver according the schedule that we outlined before, and as Bill mentioned, this additional $50 million is that of OpEx in addition to that program. I was hoping to get more color on the pacing of sequester\\'s impact in your non-EMG businesses. So, sequester hit March 1, but were there differences in behavior through the month of March as reported to the month of April, was there any benefit from folks having certainty or did you see that 5% hit across Academic and Government in a pretty linear fashion across the months and the quarter. Yeah, the sequestration wasn\\'t linear. People seem to think that they were going to be able to spend in March and so there was a little bit of noise and still some spending in March and then I think the reality that it might be a protracted discussion started hitting towards the end of March. So, we saw stronger breaking, remember that we had already being breaking from the beginning of the calendar year. But we saw stronger breaking as we got towards the end of March and April. So, really that\\'s kind of non-linear. Going forward it\\'s probably at the full the full breaking mode, which on the global basis you\\'re talking about 1.5% roughly of the life science market and we are not fully exposed. So we\\'re going to do less than a percent, but it\\'s a drag on everybody until it\\'s clear or resolved in a positive way. Okay. Thank you. Then for my follow-up question, Didier, the EPS build you\\'re looking for from Q3 to hit the midpoint of your full year guidance, Q3 to Q4. Is it bit larger than usual? So, do we think about that? Is it the timing of the benefits from the share repurchase and the restructuring, is that what\\'s using the extra quarterly boost or is there something else we should we thinking about as we roll into Q4. No, I mean, in Q4 if you do the math we’re taking the midpoint of our revenue guidance for Q3 and the midpoint guidance for Q4. You can see that we\\'re expecting revenue to be up about $100 million between Q3 and Q4 and that translates obviously into our higher EPS. Then you do have the impact of the buybacks, the overall $0.02, $0.03. There is more of an impact obviously in Q4 than Q3. And then the restructuring, the $50 million also Q3 will see just very, smaller amount of benefits yet of savings and we\\'ll start seeing some significant savings in Q4 going into Q1 of next year. Hey, thanks. I\\'m wondering with the restructuring actions you\\'ve discussed here, is the portfolio review on the table? I\\'m just thinking are their particular product lines or areas that you would maybe want to revisit, and if not, can you just talk about why commit to spending the same level of R&D for the communications business given how problematic it\\'s been? So, first of all So, first of all, we have a long history of evaluating product lines and businesses that fit in Agilent\\'s long-term strategy, and we\\'ve made the corresponding adjustments. At this point in time, we are very happy with our overall product portfolio and so we have no short-term plans to divest, for example, particular product line moving forward. If you look at our research and development spending, it has actually come down two points over the last year from 12% of revenue to roughly coming down to 10%. If you do a weighted average of the Electronic Measurement business and our LDA business, while we have a slight highly bias on R&D on the LDA, slightly lower on Electronic Measurement, we are right at the weighted average of the market moving forward.  And so, Guy has taken the adjustments in EMG accordingly. We\\'re focusing on the opportunity, particularly focusing on module instrumentation and handhelds as well as being a leader in the very high-end feature-rich instruments. So I feel very good in terms of the level of R&D that we\\'re spending and particularly excited as I said about the pipeline of new products that we\\'ll be introducing in the second half of the year. And then maybe one for Nick, I know you had a question earlier on kind of the biopharma markets, 8% growth really kind of stands out relative to the peers. Can you talk about how much of that was mass spec versus LC, and are you pulling share, and also, how much of that is coming from service? Yeah, so mass specs continues to be a strong platform for us. I would say, relative to share of LC and mass spec we\\'re holding our own. I wouldn\\'t say we\\'re outrunning the competition. You guys will see all the numbers from everybody on that. But we really saw there was a good, for lack of a better term, an easy compare in some of the geographies. So, India is coming back a bit. It was kind of flat. It\\'s been pretty negative. China looked pretty strong. So, and I said the Americas, so, it was as much a compare on the pharma and momentum as a specific product. And the pharma guys continue to go with the technology upgrade. So there is legs in that. And then last one on environmental forensics, I know that was soft. I don\\'t know if Mike has any comments on the outlook for that market. Was the weakness more biased toward Europe? We\\'ve heard that from some of the competitors? Yeah, thanks for the opportunity to share some insights here. So, it\\'s both Europe and the U.S. And the story here is continued weak government funding at both the federal and state level. So if there is one silver line, it does continue to be the emerging market; specifically, China, and you may have recently seen the announcement coming from new leadership about the Chinese dream and how they\\'re going to be the guiding principles to improve the standard of living in China. Now, that will play in very well into the environmental market. But right now, the overall numbers are down given the weakness in both U.S. and Europe. Yes, just a couple of questions either for Bill or Guy. But I wanted to just ask, with this lost manufacturing test customer has there been any change in the test protocol that makes your approach somewhat redundant and expensive relative to the different test protocol? For instance just physical layer test or a signal test, so when you get back to the market next year, do you come back with a different solution? Yes. I will have Guy answer the question regarding our overall solution and the evolution of what is a consumer based product and where testing is going and again I\\'m very excited about the direction we are going. I want to make this explicitly clear, we did not come to terms, we did not come to an agreement on contract based on terms, nothing to do other than that. Guy? Yeah, I would just highlight also that it’s definitely not a product issue or a product at very adequate for this marketplace and have been used in many customers across the world. So, the transformation that you’re referring to each of that’s really something that in fact we have lead to what we call non-call processing test. In the past, people for cellphone would have to test a phone in operation that the phone would have to connect to a base station to be fully tested. Now it is no longer tool for most of the phone test strategies and we have been a leader in helping progressing towards this, and we will keep doing this with the current generation and the future generation of our products. And can I also ask you, Guy, when I look at the EMG orders and the decline year-over-year could you just speak to the decline geographically, and just approximate decline in the three regions, in orders.  Well, if I normalize for the deal that we spoke about, that is obviously in terms of revenue mostly impacting our business in China, because that’s where the largest bases are. I would say the rest of the decline is pretty even across all geographies. So the order and the large customer that order was a China order in the past. Let me just take that question in the way we report our regional orders and revenue equal to have shown as the Americas. It is just when some times we talk about on the ship two basis that our instrument ended up in China. But on the way, we report orders and revenues which would have shown in Americas It would have been. Okay, that’s great. And then just last thought, I just had in terms of the second quarter was there, I am just referencing back to an answer that was given on sales for EMG, where there any order cancellations at the end of the second quarter because given the first quarter order level in EMG and some of the first quarter pushed business into the second. I am curious that your sales number wasn’t a little bit higher on the conversion from the first quarter orders, unless there were some cancellations? Hey, guys. I thought maybe I’d start first on the P&L, can you talk about sort of the margin progression queue to queue. I mean in terms of the 3Q guidance. And I am just trying to look out sort of what the debt in the employee detrimental are, it looks to be more significant obviously then I would have assumed just given sort of the revenue outcomes. So, maybe talk through the components sequentially of what sort of drives that, is it the type of loss business, is it FX, is it sort of the delay on some of the cost flows throughs where you’re getting the savings. I am just trying to understand the Q2 to Q3 margin progression? Sure, so I\\'ll take that one. So, Q2 to Q3, midpoint of our guidance, Q3, I mean sure about $100 million reduction in revenue sequentially. So, again, $100 million in itself that\\'s kind of $0.14 rule of thumb reduction in EPS and what we are showing is EPS going down from $0.77 to $0.62. So on average on the midpoint of the guidance.  So, I think that should answer your question, I\\'m not going to go into the specifics of OpEx and gross margins, but we are obviously, because of the loss of $100 million of revenue, gross margin will be down slightly and then we expect OpEx to be about flattish, but normally, you would expect Q3 OpEx be much higher than Q2, because of the fact that’s just the normal seasonality and that\\'s not happening. Maybe just to follow-up Bill, on Tycho\\'s question in terms of the portfolio, I mean, yeah at some businesses, that last two quarters have performed exceptionally well. Most of the assets are kind of doing what you would expect in this environment or the type of company are but the bits and pieces, whether it\\'s handset where it seems like you have forgone some business and that\\'s going to be down substantial. Then you\\'ve got the semi piece et cetera, they are a bit more volatile than the rest.  I mean as you are thinking about sort of the profile of this business continuing to have these kind of hyper-cyclical pieces, I mean, do you feel like that\\'s something that\\'s going to be a drag on your valuation? Do you think that that\\'s something that sort of makes sense given all the other pieces? I\\'m just trying to get a sense for when you have the internal debate, what are sort of the puts and takes of whether something belongs or doesn\\'t belong? Well, first of all, fundamentally, is the business a good business and one that over a business cycle returns at or above Agilent\\'s operating model. And the situation, I\\'ll use the semiconductor capital business that we kept. We essentially have a 100% market share and as a result of that has just outstanding return through the course of the cycle. And so in times like this, when parts of our Electronic Measurement are going through a tough patch, it\\'s easy to say, hey, let\\'s jettison this for a short-term gain and from our viewpoint, it just doesn\\'t make sense. So, the operating model inside of EMG has been dramatically changed over time. If you had asked me eight years ago, 10 years ago that given the headwinds that they’ve reached, they would have a 20% operating quarter, I would say there is no way. We have a great franchise and with some volatility in the downside and the flipside when this turns around, and semiconductor capital equipment and our small part expands, when you get more growth in the computer side of the house, at some of the industrial growth returns, we\\'re going to have a completely different story. In fact, if anything, we\\'re going to drive higher on the upside in our Electronic Measurement than we\\'ve done in the past, given the decisions that we have made. So, we have a great franchise in these and we will just weather the storm. Yeah, I understand sort of from the business concept perspective, I guess I\\'m trying to understand in the context of sort of what the investment community reflects relative to that volatility. I\\'m just trying to get a sense, when you benchmark internally versus peers, I mean are you looking at a distinct group for the whole asset when you\\'re trying to compare your performance, whether it\\'s on earnings growth, core growth, return on invested capital, cash flow generation, et cetera, and how you do sort of versus forecast versus your peers? Are you copying against a very distinct set of similar companies, where you feel like they have the same asset mix or are you sort of mixing and matching when you\\'re trying to figure out overall. This is why our stock is getting reflected in this way while other peers are kind of having a different view in terms of valuation?  The valuation of Agilent in some of the parts is very straightforward process. Almost everybody has MBA, know how to do the calculation. We often time use third parties to validate our own assumptions moving forward. Our pay system is tied to total shareholder return as you know, since 2005. We have consistently beat all three indexes that we compete in industrial, IT, and healthcare. Clearly, our situation has changed since we have been reclassified into the healthcare sector. The analysts that cover us and the analyst inside of big funds clearly have changed moving forward.  We also of course do that evaluation in terms of what our peers are within the healthcare. As it stands today, based on our evaluation, Agilent and again which has been confirmed from outside help is that we are trading roughly at 12% discount. If you look at the efforts in the short-term to be able to divest to go through the overhead absorption related to that and the distraction for very short-term outlook, we think just doesn’t make sense at all.  Historically, these assets perform well. We will in fact when other handset manufacturing test business, electronic measurement is a great franchise for the company moving forward and to be able to be distracted on I think quite honestly some plastic short-term view. I think just aren’t accurate. If in fact that we were trading at a substantial discount to our peer group or to now they are part of the S&P 500 that we are in. Yeah, that’s a different issue and again we have a long history of addressing that. We made the decision in 2005 to divest semiconductor related businesses and semiconductor component business because it wasn\\'t tied to our strategy of being a leader in measurement science.  So, we continue to be very pleased with our portfolio of products, and that engineering excellence, the foundation of the Company, Electronic Measurement, our financial strength has created just an incredibly competitive franchise in our Life Science Diagnostics and Applied Chemical market, and I think we are very positioned to weather this slowdown and be incredibly competitive as the economy upticks in 2014. And I guess lastly, I\\'ll ask one more simple one. So, I guess on the size of the buyback, I mean, how did you sort of get to the conclusion that that was the right level of debt assumption and sort of the right level of equity purchase. I mean it\\'s now, finally, you\\'ve guided up to $1 billion all-in for the year. So it\\'s more competitive with sort of peers and the S&P. I mean how did you go through the process of pegging about sort of balance sheet optimization and utilizing what is for you? I mean, you just said, you have a depressed level of equity versus sort of your intrinsic value calc sort of capitalizing on that given your confidence in sort of the long-term trajectory of the businesses that you are obviously managing? So we have a every detailed process that we go with the board of directors every year in September where we make a forecast of our three year growth outlook, why we believe we can outpace the market over the period of time, what our P&L looks like in our corresponding balance sheet. Given the operating model that Agilent has developed over the years, so we know we will generate substantial amount of cash. As I said with the previous question, our number one focus is to invest in the businesses going forward. The second one is return cash back to our shareholders tax effectively as we can. So this is an ongoing process that will review with the board officially in September with updates as we move forward balancing what is the short-term outlook for uses of cash for investment in the business, where is the available cash, what is the prudent amount of debt level, ensuring that we remain high caliber credit worthy company. And based on those and ongoing analysis we make the corresponding recommendation to the board on returning additional cash to the shareholder either through a dividend or a stock repurchase. Hi. Thanks, guys. This is Shaun Rodriguez on for Doug, just a couple of follow-ups from me. So you noted food market as the key driver for the Chemical Analysis Group. So I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about this? You talked about China being a driver more broadly here but specific to the food market drivers were there any specific initiatives or guideline changes or anything like that that were behind it and also your views on the sustainability of this impact over the balance of the year?  Sure. I think what you saw in the recently completed second quarter is what you’re going continue to see in the coming quarters, what you’re seeing from past several quarters, the strong overall global growth environment being driven by the globalization of food supply, increasing demands by growth population have, save food to eat and then high-quality food. And what we’re seeing now is real investment line up behind that. So I pointed to China in my earlier comments and as we talked in our previous call, the market looked like was some of the pause because there is a leadership transition under way than you get, little being ministries reorganize and that’s happening and now we’re starting to see or that has happened, we’re starting to see flows of vessels coming in the food market. I really do think this is a global play being driven out of the emerging markets, but not only constrained to those marketplaces. Then you got a great growth environment on the one end on a global basis and you have to have the right products and solutions coming into that space. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we\\'ve had a number of very exciting new offerings coming into the space, whether it be spectrometry products or mass spec, they\\'re all hitting the market and that\\'s really driving the overall market growth that you are seeing from Agilent in a very healthy, while continuing to be a very healthy food market.. Okay, great. Thanks. And then on Dako, can you provide on update where you are with this sales force expansion in Asia, when you will be fully ramped there, what kind of trends you’re seeing in response and also in Dako an update on the formal partnerships you discussed the last couple of quarters and here really put a I am asking about it, are there any specific development or commercial milestones and associated timelines that we should be thinking about? Thank you Sure, Bill. Well, we got the sales force expansion in APAC. I\\'m happy to report that we are pretty much ahead of schedule there and we have completed the hirings as per planned for the full fiscal year. So, the majority of the hirings are going into China. We are probably adding another 25 to 30 customer facing resources. They\\'re now ongoing training and we believe they\\'re going to be, starting to deliver and become operational from the third quarter.  If I look at our development in China right now, Dako year-to-date is growing at around 60%, the base is low, but we are actually placing a great number of instruments, we\\'d see substantially up compared to prior years. So, I think we\\'re making very robust progress and APAC as a region is obviously the fastest growing region for Dako at this point in time. We will continue to drive our business model towards a direct customer access. We have recently completed acquisition of a local distributor in Korea and we will be looking at other opportunities to get closer to the customer and also to capture the value stream of such a transaction going forward. So, Asia, we continue to invest in more footprint in front of the customer. In terms of the pharmDx or Companion Diagnostics as we call it right now, pleased to say that we got a major customer contract where we agreed with Pfizer on a long-term developmental agreement that obviously also comprises some type of advisory services from a regulatory point of view and also marketing point of view and this is subject to support one of the new developments in the pipeline, which is not disclosed by name at this point in time. We also got two important news, , so basically our HercepTest and the HER2 FISH is the only companion diagnostic today approved to support the use of Kadcyla from Genentech. So we are in a privileged position and we see now an uptick of our business in that regard. In terms of other milestones here, probably fair to say that we will continue to announce more partnerships with Tier 1 pharma companies in this particular field and from fiscal year 2014 and onwards, we do expect to see a steady stream of new companion diagnostic test that will be marketed through the Dako sales organization. Hi, thanks. Didier, I just have one quick question. Can you give us a sense for how we should think about your incremental and decremental margins in an environment where the growth rate is essentially below the bottom end of your business model? Yeah, I mean we covered that a little bit at the Analyst Meeting. I mean, clearly, in order to get the  at the operating model in a very low growth environment, we had to implement cuts and discretionary expenses, and also a very, very surgical kind of restructuring in addition to benefitting from the reduction in the AOF, that the AOF organization has committed to about $50 million per annum for four years in a row. So, that’s how we make it happen. If we were not able to do that, you would normally expect significant decremental when revenue growth has slowed down to such an extent. There are no remaining audio questions at this time. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for closing comments. Thank you, Patrick. Just wanted to say good day to everybody, and thank you for joining us on the call. If you have any questions, please let Elaine or myself know. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2013 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are now in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thank you, Patrick and welcome everyone to Agilent\\'s third quarter conference call for fiscal year 2013. With me are Agilent\\'s CEO, Bill Sullivan, as well as Senior Vice President and CFO, Didier Hirsch. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be Agilent\\'s President and Chief Operating Officer, Ron Nersesian. Also joining are the Presidents of our Electronic Measurement, Chemical Analysis, Life Sciences and Diagnostics and Genomics Group, Guy Séné, Mike McMullen, Nick Roelofs and Lars Holmkvist. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an Investor Presentation along with revenue breakups, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Bill and Didier\\'s comments today will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello everyone. Today Agilent reported third quarter revenues of $1.65 billion, a decline of 4% year-over-year including the Dako acquisition. Adjusted net income was $233 million or $0.68 per share. We exceeded EPS guidance despite continued challenges in many of our markets and the economic environment in general. Agilent\\'s strong three earnings reflect our ongoing commitment to actively manage costs and expenses in response to macroeconomic uncertainty. Consistent with the commitment we made in the second quarter, we successfully decreased operating expenses sequentially and we continued to benefit from our focus on reducing manufacturing costs. Before turning to the business highlights, I want to remind you, with the acquisition of Dako, we will no longer refer to our life science and chemical analysis businesses as bio-analytical measurement or BAM. Instead we will focus on LDA for life science, diagnostics and applied markets. As I mentioned last quarter, this is not an organizational change we will continue to report life science, diagnostics and genomics and chemical analysis as separate segments. LDA revenues in Q3 were $951 million up 8% year-over-year including Dako. LDA\\'s operating margin was 18%. In LDA markets, we saw a good growth in pharmaceutical, up 7% on technology upgrades, food and energy also had solid growth up 11% and 6% respectively on strong demand from China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 114% including Dako and 16% organically on good demand for our array CGH and Target Enrichment Solutions. The continued outperformance of these segments was slightly offset by expected year-over-year declines in environmental and forensics and in academic and government, down 11% and 7% respectively. Both declines are a result of the ongoing sequestration in the United States. Our focus on emerging markets continues to pay off. BriC country revenues were up double digits across almost all of LDA, with China growing more than 20% versus a year ago. Within LDA, Life Sciences revenues grew by 3% led by consumables, service, support and informatics. LHG announced several new products in Q3. Two highlights were the 1290 Infinity 2D-LC Solution and our new stream select LC/MS system. 2D-LC provides a pure resolution compared to any other LC based separation approaches. Stream select dramatically increases Mass Spec productivity for our customers. Revenues in our diagnostics and genomics group grew 54% or 6% on an organic basis, operating margins were 15%. In genomics we saw strength in CGH and good demand for our HaloPlex and SureSelect products. Demand for Dako products approached market growth which has slowed to low to mid-single-digits due to softness in Europe and the U.S. We expect the commercial launch of Dako\\'s new Omnis Autostainer in Q4 to accelerate our growth. Omnis feedback from our early customers\\' sites has been excellent. Our expansion of SureFISH into the Dako channel is on track and is expected to gain momentum in FY14. In the chemical analysis group, revenues were up 1% year-over-year, operating margins were 22%, GC sales, notably from China, and reoccurring revenue growth led CAG\\'s results. We saw the beginning of improved replacement market demand as orders increased over our new GC and GC Mass Spec products. A number of new product launches are planned over the next 12 months. Looking forward, we expect mid single-digit growth in Q4 across LDA as new products gained traction and markets that are less impacted by sequestration continue on a positive trend. Turning to the Electronic Measurement Group, revenues declined 17% as projected to $701 million. Operating margins at 18% reflected excellent gross margin management and tight expense controls in response to globally challenging market conditions. Communications revenues were down more than 30% as expected. This was primarily due to the non-recurrence of a wireless customer deal discussed in last quarterly earnings call. Industrial computer and semiconductor revenues declined 11%. Global economies remain weak, while lower PC volumes and fewer technology rollovers required less capital capacity. Aerospace and defense revenue grew 1% with strength in our non-U.S. defense business. Despite challenges in E&G\\'s markets, our investments in transformational initiatives continued to payoff. Module, AXIE and PXI platforms saw another quarter of double-digit growth, while handheld instrumentation continued to perform well. The underlying secular growth drivers in mobility and computing remain strong. As a result, we continue to invest in industry leading test solutions. We are on track to launch several new products for wireless R&D and wireless manufacturing in the coming months. Looking ahead, we expect the uncertainty Electronic Measurement macroeconomic environment to continue into Q4 with continued softness in communications, industrial, semi, computer markets As a result, we are forecasting EMG revenue to decline by low-teens in Q4. Last quarter, we announced that Agilent\\'s board of directors doubled our authorization under the current stock repurchase program. This brought our total authorization to $1 billion, inclusive of the amounts repurchased since November 1, 2012. Agilent repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock in the first half of 2013, and repurchased an additional 15 million shares during the third quarter. We have now utilized $900 million of our total authorization. We expect the program to be completed by the end of calendar year 2013. Overall, we believe we are exercising the right strategy to create long-term value for Agilent shareholders in this environment,  for the future. We continue to invest in high growth opportunities including communications, life science, diagnostics and applied in emerging markets. Our commitment to innovation R&D and excellent customer satisfaction remains strong. We have a deep pipeline of new product introductions that will enable us to differentiate and win in our targeted markets. Moving forward, we are focusing our R&D efforts on high growth segments that will drive meaningful revenue growth for the long-term. For the fourth fiscal quarter, we expect Agilent\\'s revenues of $1.7 billion to $1.72 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. Thank you for being on the call. Now, we will turn it over to Didier to more detailed discussion of our financial results. To recap the quarter, Q3 revenues adjusted for $10 million of currency headwinds were slightly above the high end of our guidance and EPS was $0.04 above the high end of our guidance as we continue to drive higher efficiency and manufacturing and SG&A as well as enforced strict expense controls. Core orders, which exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions, were down 5% year-over-year, while core revenues decreased 6%. Core orders at EMG were down 15% year-over-year, or down 8% excluding the non-recurring wireless manufacturing test deal of a key account discussed at last quarter\\'s conference call while LDA core orders were up 4%. Within LDA, LSG core orders were up 2%, CAG\\'s up 6% and DGG\\'s up 6%. Core revenues at the EMG were down 16% year-over-year or down 7% excluding the key accounts wireless manufacturing test deal, while LDA core revenues were up 4%. Within LDA, LSG core revenues were up 4%, CAG\\'s up 3% and DGG\\'s, up 7%. By region, core revenues were down in the Americas by 17% and Europe by 3%, but were up in Japan by 9% and the rest of Asia Pacific by 3%. LDA core revenues grew in all regions where EMG\\'s were down in all except Japan. To note, LDA revenues in China were up 21% after 16% growth in Q1 and 14% growth in Q2. Both, EMG and LDA delivered a strong operating margin of over 18% with more potential for margin expansion and increasing operating leverage as the economy picks up steam. Regarding cash, we generated $215 million in operating cash flow. We issued debt of $600 million during the quarter and paid off $250 million notes maturing that quarter. We also spent $681 million on share repurchases. We also spend $681 million on share repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt position of $315 million. Now turning to the guidance for our fourth quarter, the mid-point of our revenue guidance at $1.71 billion correspond to a year-over-year decline of 1% on a core basis. Made up of a decline of 11% for EMG and a growth of 7% for LDA, including CAG at 6%, LSG at 6% and DGG at 12%, all on a core basis. The mid-point of our EPS guidance at $0.76, represents a sequential increase of $0.08. Finally, the guidance for the full year. The mid-point of our revenue guidance at $6.77 billion is down $30 million from the midpoint of the May guidance, or down $10 million adjusted for changes in currency. EMG is down approximately $20 million, where LDA is up approximately $10 million. At mid-point, we expect EMG revenues to reach $2.89 billion, down 12% on the core basis and LDA $3.88 billion, up 5% on a core basis. Overall, Agilent revenues of $6.77 billion at mid-point will be down 3% on a core basis. Regarding EPS, we are raising the mid-point of our fiscal year 2013 guidance by $0.06 to $2.84. To note, our restructuring plan impacting about 500 employees is on track and most of the $50 million savings would be achieved by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2014. Yes. Just have a couple of questions on the EMG business Bill, could you just layout your expectations for the aerospace defense business? Maybe over the next 12 months to 24 months, when you just think about how sequester plays into the U.S. piece, and is there any visibility offset rest of world there? I mean do you feel comfortable that that can continue to offset most of the sequester decline in U.S.? It is a great question. I am going to have  make a comment as well. As you know, in the aerospace and defense, the team is really focused on satellite, guiding systems, operational, surveillance, we have been very pleased with our success outside the U.S. I think every quarter is always a nail biter to know exactly where the U.S. is going to end up, so Guy maybe you can make a couple of comments in terms of what you are seeing in the short-term in the U.S. defense spending? Sure. Thank you, Bill. Definitely, as you have seen our revenue was up 1% in this quarter, mostly because of very strong orders from the international business and places like Europe and Japan for some very exciting business I must say around satellites, mostly. Going forward, our Q4 is seasonally usually one of the strongest and highest quarters better for the U.S. DoD and aerospace defense and that is really going to be the key focus. We have seen a number of engagements, so we must say we get a lot of people asking for quotes going forward but the real issue is how much authority and how much budget will these people have in Q4 so that\\'s going to be the big unknown that we have to work through in Q4 now. Okay. Just one follow-up on the life sciences piece of the business, the book-to-bill is seasonally softer than normal. Is there a read into that? Yes. Overall, our orders were just slightly a little bit below what we like going in Q4. I don\\'t think there is any particularly alarm, but I have Nick make a couple of comments in terms of what he is seeing in the life science from order perspective. Yes. Just consistent with Bill\\'s comments. Not exactly where we would have loved it to be but no real alarms, the pharma guys are still very strong and the academic sector is as we said soft with a lot of concern and confusion, so at this point we flushed a lot of backlog, which is a good thing and we are working to recharge that this quarter. Congratulations on being able to get a good quarter under the belt despite the challenges that everyone knows that are out there. I guess, Bill, on the electronic measurement side of the business again, you mentioned obviously there is Apple that you can do the math on the impact that, I am sorry, the big wireless customer deal we can do the math on. You mentioned some new products that you are going to be launching in electronic in handsets manufacturing as well as in R&D. I guess sitting here today, and I know you probably won\\'t give an outlook for 2014, but how are you feeling about where you are positioned from a product standpoint and all the different moving pieces and the comps? What your first take on where do you think that business is going to be doing over the next 12 months all-in? Then again, I will have Didier make a comment as well but overall, I think the communication mobility is going to continue to be a driver for the electronic measurement business going forward regardless of the one customer deal. We have a very strong product position and I am very, very excited about the products that we have in the pipeline. We are not backing away from this market. We are going to continue to invest market share changes overtime but the underlying essentials of the communications market, particularly in this whole area of mobility, radios and every mobile device, I still think is a great opportunity for the company. Yes, and this is Didier. I can add, definitely there is a lot of innovation going into this sector. As you know, there is new challenges because of the spectrometer use and now standards like LT advanced and carrier aggregation and in the wireless networking a lot of new things happening that provides quite some opportunity in R&D and in manufacturing. Our new products portfolio is doing well. We just introduced the wireless connectivity test set that is very focused on testing wireless standards like 802.11ac and now we have received our first orders and now a very strong permanent thing for the future. Then as Peter was saying, we will work obviously at the next generation of platform that you will hear more about later. In closing, even though we have some difficult compares due to one issue, we are absolutely committed to this market and we will continue to be a leader in this market and we will continue to invest heavily to ensure that we provide leadership products in the communication market. Just to be clear, as you have lapped that one issue obviously, I know you are not giving guidance again, but we have one quarter left, so the street will be obviously putting targets out there for next year. Are you willing to quantify at all, what you think is a reasonable assumption for EMG in 2014? You are going to have to wait until the next quarter\\'s earnings call. As you know that\\'s when we currently give our guidance for 2014. Okay, that\\'s fair, and then if I can, just wanted to follow up on the Dako business. I don\\'t know if there is any kind of commentary for Roche and for Leica. It was kind of a weak business, well particularly in the U.S., but it seems like relative to where you would hoped that business would come in, it\\'s a little bit softer. So can you maybe talk about where you think the main drivers of that are and what you think can get that business growing at a rate that you needed to given the acquisition that you did? I am going to make a comment and turn it over to Lars but we are very excited where we are going. The markets slowing down, as you said. The good news is that means that we are really close to where the market is, lower number but we are highly competitive. As I said in my notes, we are going to be launching Autostainer which has been the biggest impediment to their growth but what I am also particularly excited about is the Agilent products that are being sold in the clinic and diagnostics. We are a small number, but still a very solid growth in the clinic with the Agilent products. I have just been very pleased with Lars\\' ability to put the two organizations together and really focus on what I think is going to be an exciting growth opportunity for the company. Lars, why don\\'t you give us some of the details of where you are and obviously comments about the growth rate that Didier noted for our next quarter. Yes. That\\'s a bit of an kind of exciting time we are in right now. Let me address the market perspectives that we see here. I think fundamentally the volume growth of the market are there in the vast majority of the geographies. Obviously, we have seen some guideline changes in the U.S. market that, in my book and also in the view of the industry, is going to be there temporarily and we will see that impact probably for another quarter or two until that flushes out and that becomes annualized but the overall volume growth in Europe as well as in APAC is very robust and very strong. So, I don\\'t think that there is any panic in terms of, will this market still continue to be an attractive market and will it be copied? In my book, it will be. Again, its going to take maybe a quarter or two. Now Dako performance, relative to the market, well it\\'s fair to say that we have improved our relative position maybe not to the extent that we had hoped at this point in time because obviously we want to drive growth and we are right now, I would say, holding the market growth. We probably growing at 2%, 3% with core Dako. It varies between the product lines and the overall market characterizes somewhere around 4% growth rate right now. So we are flattish with the market but we are right now in a real crossroads situation where we are switching between the old platform and now about to launch full speed new Dako Omnis that we are still controlling in feed sites. We have the fairly large amount of systems out there. The feedback from the customers is really stellar at this point in time and you might know, a very important note would be around the staining quality that we for Dako Omnis which is at the level or even better as in the prior platform. And this is a really, really strong feedback, because staining quality is something which counts and something that Dako has been well known for in the past. So I am very excited about what I am seeing here and talking about a couple of the growth drivers, Dako Omnis is a very powerful instrument. It\\'s geared at some larger accounts where Dako typically has had the smaller market share. So we do expect a pick up to come and it\\'s going to be an incremental pick up in terms of slight volume as well as larger accounts. So I am pretty pleased with what we are looking into right now in the initial forecast and roll up for the Dako basis in Q4. Again I am going to say,  till the next quarter talking about \\'14; business is picking up and the team is getting really motivated and ready. I think in terms of quality index, Dako is probably going to  one of the more powerful new product pipelines unleashed, now being unleashed, but also hitting the market in \\'14. So, in a sense, I think we have bottomed out and from here on I think you will see Dako pick up the pace and my expectation is that Dako is going to be above the market growth rate here in the couple of quarters. So we are making progress and the business is very healthy for us right now. Just a 30 second comment on the GSD part of it. Very pleased to see now how the momentum is building and gaining for the GSD business. We see our penetration and that\\'s our strategy into the clinical segment actually paving the way for the growth rates here. Looking at the core growth for GSD this quarter, which is around 8% and that compares very well and very favorable with the friends in the industry that we compare ourselves with every quarter. So pace is picking up. Momentum is picking up. Enthusiasm is picking up and profitability is picking up for the business. Stay tuned I think for more news around our GSD business going forward. Bill, I was hoping maybe you can start off by just highlighting maybe your top down view? How you feel maybe if you look back last quarter this time versus today? I know you are still highlighting a lot of challenging things going on but you are executing through that. Is it kind of fair to say there is no difference or are you seeing any pockets of improvement? Certainly some results have improved, certainly in U.S. and Europe, while China continued to tread. I am just wondering, overall, how you feel about the globe? Right now, in terms of our LDA business, as we had indicated both in our core growth rate and forecast for Q4, we are clearly gaining momentum on our LDA business. We had some great momentum, hit the slowdown, our growth rate was at or slightly below market and I think our momentum is going to go back to at or greater than market and again a lot of that, as Lars just described, moving forward and our chemical analysis and life science business, I believe, will have a momentum going forward. As I noted in my notes are progress in the BriC countries and the investment we have made continues to payoff. On the electronic measurement side, as the forecast, as until we get through the tough compares, I think it\\'s an industry that\\'s under a lot of pressure, both from the change in technologies to mobility, the change of who the winners are versus the losers, it is a highly competitive market. As a result of that it\\'s still a tough environment. If you take any sort of macroeconomic improvement sorting out exactly who the winner is going to be on the technology side, the Electronic Measurement of course comes roaring back, so I think that\\'s still a wait and see, LDA is clearly we are gaining momentum as we go into Q4. Okay. Great. Maybe just sticking with some of the prior questions on EMG, as we think about Q4, can you just remind us does that, I know you may be mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but maybe I missed it. Does the loss of that one customer is that impacting your Q4 guidance? I mean if you strip out that loss is there a better rate of growth that you will be achieving? And within communications particularly there has been a lot of rhetoric about this China mobile business. I am just kind of wondering how do you guys think about the build out of LTE in China if that possibly will have an impact on whether it be your fourth quarter or we have to look in the fiscal 2014 for that. Dan, this is Didier. I will take the first part of the question. Yes. Last year, our revenues with that account were about 25% in Q2, 50% Q3 and 25% in Q4. When I provided the guidance for Q4, that EMG would be down 11% on the core basis excluding that account, EMG would be down 6%. Yes. I may take at least the question on the China mobile discussion that this is obviously something that is very visible. You know that China mobile is in the middle of selecting their supplier, so you have opened a bit of. It is our understanding there is at least nine companies bidding for this and they will decide by end of August to early September who is going to be the winners of that. Obviously, we are very well positioned with all of them. We follow and track this business very closely, but then I still would like to make sure that everybody understands that the size of the opportunity is in my mind more in the $30 million plus or minus $10 million. Again when you think about August, China Mobile has planned to announce to spend about $6.7 billion on this deal. This is before bidding, so we don\\'t know what\\'s the real deal is going to be out of and only half of this volume is going to be really electronics so the rest is going to be buildings and a lot of other supplies and this means when you look at the test side especially with the capacity that is in already in the system and depending who is going to win the opportunity is what I said. So, we are tracking this very closely. On the other side, I think it will also provide us real gross vector for the overall 4G especially in China as we go into 2014 and 2015 and as China developed the 4G network going forward. Great. Thank you. Maybe one quick Didier, just on the buyback. You certainly utilized a fair amount of this quarter. Is there any possible signaling with that buyback maybe until rest of this quarter versus leaving a little in the fourth like in terms your view on the stock price where it was throughout the quarter versus your expectation going forward? Thanks a lot. We were opportunistic. Obviously, we did raise $600 million in debt. We had initially I mean we said we would count on more than $300 million that will come in November, but because we had that not available and we felt the time was right which was jumped in we still have the $300 million that comes in November as a tax effective cash repatriation similar to last year\\'s $550 million. Maybe one for Nick just on the pharma comments earlier. You talked about technology upgrades. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that some from the LC side versus mass spec? Maybe talk about any sheer dynamics there and are you actually getting traction for the new product launches yet or how do you think about there? Tycho. So, let me break that down for you. We are doing pretty well in LC. The new product launches they aren\\'t having much of an effect yet. We are getting orders but not revenue, pharma guys are doing well in terms of buying. We are at the end of their upgrade cycle in terms of replacement, but we are still seeing a technology buy up cycle, so there is a good secular growth and that has been strong in pharma. Mass spec for us has been a little bit softer in pharma. We see pharma still buying technology, but right now they are looking heavily at Triple Quad. There has been a lot of new product in the market and so there is a lot of valuation phase and so orders are kind of in the slower spot there. Okay. Then maybe Bill, your comments on EMG earlier, as we think about kind of the outlook there and I know you didn\\'t really want to talk about 2014 that much, but as we think about kind of the next 12 to 18 months for EMG. Is it fair to take kind of your fourth quarter number and use that as a starting point for a recovery or how do you think about the lumpiness of recovery for EMG ? Well. The issue that you have in EMG, if you look at historically is that there is a recovery in macro and continued investment in communication and the new product launches we are going to make us successful they tend to do incredibly well and so I think that\\'s what we have to see. Do we see continued strengthening in the world economy, EMG themselves come out with an next round of competitive products and we are able to capitalize on that and you can get a lot of movement of revenue correspondently. I always talk about this business. We always try to forecast and all we know it\\'s wrong going to be higher or lower. Again, if you look at their history, they historically have always kind of roaring back with some economic tailwinds and of course a great set of new products. Okay. Then the last one on environmental, you said it\\'s weak government spending. Any hope that business may turnaround kind of given the backdrop? Great question. So, let\\'s chase the source of the downturn we see in this. It really all is tied to weak government spending, primarily U.S. and in Europe and bit in Japan, so that really has impacted the business both, at the federal and state level for example in United States. I think the glimmer of hope in this segment and I still think there\\'s going to be for a while as the strength in emerging markets. As Bill mentioned early, across the board double-digit growth and we are seeing some increase volume in environmental side on a private sector related to fracking, where in the U.S. there a lot more samples running through our private contract customer labs as a result of the checking samples in the local environment. So, I think the story is all about the government spending in a lot of the key large geographies and your crystal ball in terms of what will happen in terms of their spend outlook is far better than mine. Thanks very much. We can stick with LSG just for a minute. Nick, I wanted to ask you about the operating margins which were strong in the quarter and you mentioned that the backlog you were able as I seem to recall you were able to extinguish it. The question really is can those operating margins continue through Q4. Then second if I may Bill or Didier on EMG if we take up a large customer concerned. Could we suggest that EMG business literally has troughed and that also reflects a trough margin of where we are today. Is that possible? Thank you very much. Our operating margins are work in progress and that\\'s the good news to your question. We saw some real mileage to go particularly in NMR, which has some weak margins in there, so I think we are making progress and I think it\\'s a work in progress. I am pretty optimistic on where those go, sequentially. Okay. Why don\\'t Guy make a comment at least in terms of the trough? Also have Ron talk about the progress we are making at manufacturing. Again, yes, we talk about the macro environments, but we are attempting control what we should control and that is our manufacturing efficiency and obviously our expense structure. Well, I would say it is a perhaps the order rates growth of EMG over the quarter. You could say that order rates is picking up and we have had the bottom is behind us. Now, obviously, it\\'s all about Q4 and how this is going to shape up the new products as Bill was mentioning. Our manufacturing consolidation programs continue to be on track and we are doing a real effective job of taking millions of dollars out of this system. We saw over $50 million worth of cost reductions last year. Roughly that same amount this year, then more coming after that, so we are very, very pleased with the manufacturing consolidation and we look forward to delivering more to the bottom-line. Bill, I appreciate your enthusiasm on EMG but is the absolute level of EMG bookings not concerning here? I mean I am not speaking about comps or one customer but just the fact that ENG\\'s run rate is some 15% trough levels back in FY09, it just doesn\\'t feel like nearly that bad as a macro backdrop. Can you offer some context into that I guess from my perspective again, what Guy said, the group in itself, regardless of the one customer opportunity, it continues to go the transformation. We continue to invest in communications in a very tough competitive environment. We continue to make investments in module instrumentation that we must win in module instrumentation. It is going to be a multi-year effort. We have another quarter of very, very solid double-digit growth moving forward. So EMG, in a sense, is how do I protect the bottom-line for Agilent? How do I ensure that I take the best communication business that I can? And then how do I invest in the future? Again, always the question is, as we go to modular business, how much of that is substitution versus winning the broader market and getting do you have a comment, but we are making the investment in EMG to ensure that they have the portfolio of products and the only one that has portfolio of products to have low cost transducers just enough test to having these very feature rich instruments that we have been noted for, for the last 75 years. So again we got a lot of moving parts inside of EMG, but from my perspective, I have watched the business for many, many decades, I am absolutely positive that we are focusing on the right things. Didier? I will just add that for all product categories that we have in our portfolio, we have a very strong leading position and I am glad to see that again we keep taking share, in oscilloscopes, for instance as we go forward and the modular program as Bill was mentioning, is going extremely fast and on new applications that really we are into it. So ongoing focus on the core markets where we see growth going forward makes a difference and we will make a difference. The last comment I would have, and again this goes back, and not to be an excuse, is we have always had a very strong position in manufacturing. We have always had a strong position in computers and semiconductor. As you know, the computer and semiconductor market are not great. So we have had some bad breaks on the mix and again we choose that business. So again I am making an excuse but nonetheless I can\\'t state strongly enough that we are making the right investment and we are focusing on the right products for the long haul. Thanks, and then just one follow-up for Nick. Can you speak to any Japan stimulus impact that you may have experienced? Is that more of an order phenomena or was there any contribution in terms of revenue in the period? Yes, Brandon, right now it is order noise, primarily. There is probably a little bit of revenue leakage but we are pretty optimistic in what our base is doing there and trying to drive enthusiasm and we are seeing some monies come out of the private sector just because of the enthusiasm of growth. Obviously it\\'s not government money but right now the stimulus in Japan is more noise and order optimism than it is revenue. I guess, for Bill or Didier. I wanted to drill down on wireless manufacturing, post some of the share shift over the last year. Can you help us understand the revenue contribution that wireless manufacturing is currently within, either communications or EMG ? Then I think earlier you replied to a question that you expect to be a leader in the communication segment but if we dig specifically in the communications and focus on wireless manufacturing, given the entry of two very disruptive competitors, would you expect wireless manufacturing to be a driver of growth over the next few years. Well, let me start with the second question then on the first. The wireless manufacturing business, as we said, has always been very lumpy and depends on a few set of players. We are a player in this environment. We have a platform that is currently winning and now, as we mentioned earlier, we are working on a new generation of platforms that will allow us to compete even stronger in this marketplace. So clearly we keep focusing there. The core element are still an interest of our future going product line is in the R&D sector. We have an extremely strong set of portfolios from software simulations that goes into R&D up to design validation and conformance testing. We will keep timing of upgrading and updating and adding more solutions into this portfolio to really keep playing our role in wireless full ecosystem from R&D to manufacturing. Perfect, and then I guess Bill, you discussed strength in modular instrumentation in the quarter and you stated that you have to win in modular instrumentation. Can you help us understand just so we can get a sense of what level this strength is coming out of? What is the revenue contribution of modular instrumentation currently taking EMG segment? I guess my perception is that it\\'s very low single-digit percentage contribution. Is that a fair approximation? Well I think we mentioned it in the last earnings call. I mean it\\'s still a small percent but last year it threw $100 million, not counting the software part of it and we mentioned that in the Analyst Day. We continue to grow double-digits and we are spending $70 million a year to win. So we are absolutely committed and Ron has mentioned this many times, we have been in the module business for years but if you put our software efforts together with our module instrumentation, my guess is Ron is getting faster close to 10% of the overall EMG. We are making real progress. Perfect, and perhaps I guess for Bill or Didier, I maybe reading too much into this but your fourth quarter revenue and earnings guidance range appeared a little bit narrower than the range you provided in past quarters. I assume you interpret for us to mean perhaps you are little bit more comfortable of the stability of the business or conversely could this mean that the tightening of your delivery policy has led to fewer vacillations and deliveries towards the end of the quarter that\\'s given you a little bit more comfort. No, I understand that but we are comfortable with the guidance that we have given, given the backlog and expected ship of board. Maybe a question for Lars. Lars, I am trying to reconcile over this very positive commentary on Dako with some of the proposed reimbursement cuts here in the U.S. in segments it looks like it might effect to you, like station, special scanning and what have you. Could you address how you are thinking about potential cuts with your mix of the business and the opportunity going forward? Yes, well I see that. Obviously, we are very well aware about guideline changes and potentially reimbursement changes that might be impact our businesses overall. I think if I step back, it will get, our overall position in the U.S. market in terms of kind of  industry and the FISH business. We are starting from a fairly low position. So, if I were sitting on a market share with just 65%, 70% for FISH or ISH or IC, I will probably have couple of sleepless nights but then we start literally from a low single digit market share position in the FISH business and a relatively low on IC, I still feel this is incremental upside for us going forward, given the fact that we are now going to penetrate this segment. So, it depends on who you talk to here. If you talk to some of our competitors, I think they have a considerable different exposure then the Dako organization has. Got it, that\\'s helpful, thank you. Then my follow-up question for whoever wants to take it. We are nearly six months now since you shined a brighter light on your efforts to improve NMR. I am wondering if you could offer more color on the progress in those efforts? Thanks for the question, Dan. We continue to slog through NMR. If you recall, the challenge here is really to reformat the business. We have done quite a bit of that then to reframe the manufacturing, that process is pretty much complete. Then to launch new technologies and we are in that cycle now, so we have got technologies flowing out now that utilize our electronics capabilities in the core platform. We continue to evolve and we are going to disseminate that further and further across the product line and we have also refocused the business away from the academic sector and more heavily towards the industrial sector and that\\'s just a reflection of macroeconomic, so work in progress and we continue to slog through. It\\'s not a pretty picture, but we are on track to what we showed you when we were in New York. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. First one was on China. You guys didn\\'t touch on it a bit in your prepared comments, but I was wondering if you would give us a sense of the bigger in terms of how orders trended throughout the quarter and then maybe put that in context with what we saw in China regarding credit conditions and just general capital spending. Clearly long-term secular growth opportunity, but still little choppy in China for the back half of this calendar year, so any color there would be helpful. Thank you. In terms of China, I mean, the story for China for us is LDA. Mike, why don\\'t you talk a little bit about I mean, a lot of it was on the applied side and so course if Nick has any comments moving forward. On electronic side, of course is dominated by depending on who the big players are that we want and what not, but really the story in China is on the LDA side, so Mike why don\\'t you give some color on your China business last quarter? Sure, Bill. I think this is more than just a quarter story, in fact you may recall some of our previous conversation in prior analyst call where we talked about there been a positive business latter of part of last year with the reformation of the new government and their emphasis on improving the quality of life and China dream that we are very bullish on the prospects for our business in China. In fact, we are now seeing that come into real orders into the business and I think that consistent with that philosophy in terms of the focus on improving the quality of life we are seeing continue to see very significant investments in the food segment as well as environmental testing segment, but also a strong growth in chemical energy as they continue to build out their industrial infrastructure, so we can point to other segments in the applied side being up in China and I think indicative of long-term secular trends that you referred to earlier question. Another question comes up about the impact on possible credit tightening. We have not yet seen that in our business. This is Nick. Same comments as Mike, the pharma industry pretty strong building out infrastructure. We are pretty insulated. If you look at the macro credit challenges, that\\'s in the housing industry, it\\'s in the consumer products and it\\'s in the factory infrastructure. Pharma factories are getting built up by multinationals as well as government, so that hasn\\'t being impacted. So, we are very bullish on what\\'s going on in China. Got it. Then just maybe for either Nick or Lars, question on diagnostics. If I put your comments on Dako and then your other genomics tool sort of in context here, can you give us a sense of how much work you think you need to do to build up the franchise going forward? You obviously have a lot of stuff in the pipeline already organically, but just to sort of get that business in critical mass relative to the competition and relative to your other divisions, can you give us a sense of how much work do you think you have to do there? Yes. Let me take that one. It\\'s a good question. Actually I came out of the breakout meeting my team yesterday where you addressed that situation. It\\'s a  to be part of Agilent, but all of you can see that we are a small part of Agilent. I think we have the prospects for us, because the market opportunity is certainly there. Obviously, the organic growth play that you see can be either high single-digit up to maybe mid-single-digit, depends on how look at the business. How aggressive you fund it and so forth. This is going to be a transformation of industry and our book and we believe that we have to think big to participate here, because it will continue to consolidate then the fewer is going to get bigger and it\\'s a choice that we make on how we are going to think about that business. Obviously, organic growth rate is going to get us a bit, but in my book we had to look big here and see the opportunities that are ahead. Obviously no commitment on time or any significance of that, but there\\'s a great number of opportunities that we are looking at right now. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe talk a bit about how the organization responded to some of the cost measure you did. Obviously, it\\'s always tough to adjust workforce et cetera, and so it looks like on the OpEx line and even on the gross margin line, you guys did a really nice job on execution, so maybe just give some comments in and out on how do you feel like the organization responded? I will give my perspective, because I didn\\'t have to do the work and then I will turn it over to Ron. He did, did the work with the team. Our organization response to task, adversity, reaction to market conditions incredibly well. We know how to do this, we have a very robust management system to ensure that we can execute on a strategy even if it\\'s a tactical one in terms of reducing cost. As Didier alluded to, we are right on track and the team has executed and we have done it in such a way that the employees impacted were treated fairly respectfully. Again, we continue to ensure that they can hopefully do everything we can that they can land on their feet. But, from my view point, I think the execution has been excellent. Ron? We have a very smart, well educated work force and they understand how their job is to provide shareholder value. So, as we have seen this economic situation, they understood what we were doing and we have seen great support. All of the functions that we are involved managed to go through this and it\\'s going very smooth. It\\'s very difficult to see some of the reductions, but on the other hand everybody get it and I am very pleased with the progress. Good afternoon. Really just I think three quick clean up questions. First, Didier, could you provide assumptions for fiscal Q4 operating margin by segment, at least what you have incorporated into guidance? Second, I guess for either Guy or Didier. I just want to confirm that there is no tail to the large, I guess, $230 million order loss beyond fiscal Q4. This was obviously a multi-quarter headwind for EMG this year and I just want to confirm that. This was attributable to only one account loss and that this is essentially a discrete one-time dynamic that will be behind you after this quarter. Then third, Nick, earlier you spoke about the book-to-bill in LSG coming up a bit light of your expectations, yet it just seems like that you guided LSG revenue growth in Q4 to levels that are least in line if not maybe above Street expectation, so I was just curious if you would talk about whether not you saw some strength in ordering patterns maybe early in the quarter? Thank you. Hi, Doug, I will take the first question regarding operating margin in line with the guidance for Q4 for EMG and LDA. It\\'s about the same, both of them slightly North of 19% for the both EMG and LDA. Obviously slightly above 19% for Agilent, overall at mid-point. The question on tail of the order, we got some orders in Q1 that we shipped in shipped in Q2, so there\\'s is going to be tail, but far smaller than what we had as compared so far Then Doug to your question, we did have a rising trend of orders across the quarter, so that\\'s the first part of your question. Then in Q4, we have got a little bit of an easy compare as well, so that\\'s why you see the kind of guidance we get so we think we are pretty sound there. Hi. This is actually  for Amit today. Nick, I had one to start for you. In the pharma business, can you make any comments on what you saw in the early stage discovery business there? Not sure I understand the question. You mean in terms of what they are ordering or what the pattern is? Yes, I mean just how did they fare during the quarter? What did you see coming from that side of the business? Yes, so what we are seeing in early stage discovery, that\\'s where we see most of the technology stuff. So most of the technology upgrade because what they are doing in early stages discovery across the whole therapeutic sector is biologic. So that\\'s a big driver from mass spec and it\\'s a big driver for our biologically compatible LC, not to mention our general UHPLC product. So that has been a pretty strong sector. That was probably the leading piece of the pharma portfolio. Okay, and then just overall on Europe, was there anything there that set out? I know it was weak in the quarter but any end markets in particular that were stronger than expected Certainly, within LDA, as I mentioned Europe grew on a core growth basis whereas EMG was down. So that gives you an indication of what markets are and which ones are down. Okay, and then were there any overall trends in the quarter on the revenue side as far as pacing goes in July and maybe early into August? Given that we still have a very high percentage of capital equipment, our revenue always tends to be back-end loaded in the quarter and that\\'s why we continue to report orders because they really are good indication of future business. But we typically ship more in the last month of the quarter than the first. Then of course once we started doing that it lasts for decades. Bill, I wanted to ask a question about the overall business mix from the high level from the standpoint of cyclicality versus non-cyclicality. Notwithstanding the work you have done over the past few years to try to reduce the cyclicality of the business, it is still fairly cyclical. So would you anticipate wanting to make any changes, whether it be additions to the portfolio or subtractions from the portfolio to change that going forward or are you happy where it is at this point. The strategy that we embarked on in 2005 after we spun off our semiconductor business has proved very effective. We will soon have a $4 billion LDA business, not to give a forecast for next year but we are very, very close to that, and the investment we made both organically and inorganically has been exactly what we wanted to do, bring our engineering expertise to be able to expand from our engineering, chemical engineering foundation, the life science and diagnostics moving forward that would be a continued investment that we have. The volatility we have, of course, is in electronic measurement. They have done a superb job of managing the operating margins through what is just inherently a very volatile business. So I believe that we have executed on our strategy and we will continue to focus on growing our LDA business and continue to be a leader in electronic measurement with what is really the highest profits in the industry. Okay, thanks, and a real quick one for Lars. On the cytogenetics market, you talked about some strength in the array business there. Do you anticipate that that might cannibalize some of the opportunities in the FISH market? I know that was part of the thesis for the Dako acquisition. I am just wondered how this idea of growth in the cytogenetics arrays kind of plays into that outlook? Well, no. I don\\'t think that there is going to be a large degree of cannibalization, honestly. I think the CDH or arrays plays its role. The FISH is going to be there for preliminary  testing and so far there is still a lot of room for growth for a company like Agilent in the FISH business there nor through an intense competitor. I think it\\'s fair to say that we are making good progress as an organizational developing kind of universal type of probe that\\'s going to fit both, say, around the cyto space as well as the pathology business. So I don\\'t think that that is a trend at all. It\\'s just a great opportunity for a company like Agilent. I just wanted to ask a little questions about the academic and government. You have about 7% of the revenues in the quarter from academic and government and that\\'s not the aerospace and defense portion of it. Yet you said you were down about 7% in that market. I am just curious what was that excluding currencies? The reason why I am asking is that you have, relative to you peers, a lot less exposure to some of the academic markets out there. I am just curious as why your business maybe a little bit weaker than maybe some of your peers are reporting? Is there something going on that I am missing. Derek I will answer the question obviously from life sciences perspective. I don\\'t think there is anything missing. We have a big CapEx in the academic and government. So as we are getting towards the end of fiscal year for the U.S., that\\'s where the big stall and the sequestration is coming. Our exposure is certainly less in aggregate than others but I am not sure that our response was significantly different, if you cut just to the CapEx piece. I think that\\'s just the report. Many of our competitors have lots of consumables, lots through reagents. They are down but they all never be as down typically as much as we do given the bias towards capital investment. Well. I was just sort of more comparing to like Waters, for example. I mean their number is were a little bit there. But I will take it is more CapEx and more in that sense. On the diagnostic and genomics business, the gross margin in that business has been down year-over-year on all three quarters despite the fact the organic revenue growth has been a lot better than expected in that segment, at least to my model. I guess is that due to product launches, FX? Could you just talk a little bit more about what\\'s going on. Then I guess ultimately where does the gross margin in that business sort of go to? I will Lars talk about it. We obviously make an huge investments in the business and the mix but as I said very clearly there is full expectations that Lars\\' business will get to the 20% operating model of the company or higher, moving forward. But Lars, why don\\'t you talk a little bit about the short term investments and what\\'s going on. Yes, I will still kind of address the root cause to the question. What you have to realize is when Dako comes in basically through a new kind of accounting standard, there is a reclassification from what is the expense lines to the COGS line and COGS line to the expense line and so forth. So there is a one-off distorts that pick to some extent in combination with the genomic basically that\\'s kind of an ongoing operation and it has been there for years. So that\\'s kind of the one-ff phenomenon that\\'s being washed out and fixed out right now. I think what you will see now is fundamentally a quarter or two where we have been sort of weak in terms of a product mix which has been unfavorable. It\\'s been skewed towards a bit more instrumentation than consumables. As you know, we are sourcing our instrumentation literally from OEM providers out there and pay a margin on getting the boxes done for us and so forth. So, as we get more of the Dako on the solution boxes out there, it will drive much more reagents on top of it, we feel that our gross margins are going to creep up north. We don\\'t see a tremendous amount of cost pressure or price pressure in our accounts and our business right now. It\\'s a bit here and there but basically this is still a well behaving industry, the  trends comparison and so forth. So I see that gross margins are going to stabilize and even increase with the onset of more FISH business coming on stream for us, which is typically a higher business. So to Bill\\'s point, what he has alluded to, the operating margin today for a group which is 15%, which is a little bit higher on genomics, a little on Dako, I expect it\\'s going to climb pretty high here. We would be onset to more volume of all consumables. So I think it\\'s a long answer, but that\\'s the facts that I see here. Okay. This is Didier. I was going to update, the gross margin for DGG really has stayed fairly constant at 60%. It was 60.8% last year in Q3 and Q3, 59.4% so plus 1% point reduction and Lars really explained why the mix played that and basically it withdrew about 1% from the margins, but it\\'s about the same thing of the opening profits, plus 16.2% last year, 14.6% this year. So again a lot of the mix issues that have been raised by Lars. And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\\'s conference. I would now like to turn the call over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Well, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today and certainly if you have any calls, please feel free to call myself or Elena, and have a good day. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\\'s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

Thank you for joining us on today’s call. Our new Agilent team had a strong year. Let me start by highlighting our fourth quarter performance, focusing on three key numbers.  First, revenue is up 6.2% on a core basis. Second, adjusted operating margin is up 150 basis points to 21.9%. Finally, EPS of $0.50 is above the high end of our guidance. Now I would like to talk about our full-year results. For the full-year, our core revenue is up 6.4%. It is worth noting that this is our highest annual core growth rate since 2011. Adjusted operating margin is up 80 basis points to 19.6% and EPS of $1.74 is above the midpoint of both our November 2014 and August 2015 guidance.  We offset significant FX headwinds and $40 million of dis-synergies from the spin-off of our electronic measurement business. Our fourth quarter capped off a stellar performance by the team in our first year of the New Agilent. This team has not skipped a beat as we’ve navigated through a CEO transition, implemented a new strategy and dealt with changing market conditions. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our commitment to drive both growth and operating margin expansion.  Now let me move on to more details on what is going on within the business. Our Q4 results are driven by strength in the pharma, diagnostics, clinical and food markets. Geographically, we saw core growth across all regions, with particular strength in our liquid chromatography offerings, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics products. Let me highlight the Q4 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. Strong performance in Pharma was offset by softness in the industrial and academia & government markets. LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 20%, down 20 basis points from a year ago.  In November, Agilent closed its acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Seahorse is a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics. Seahorse’s unique technology is the perfect complement to Agilent’s market-leading separations and mass spec solutions, in particular for metabolomics and disease research in pharma. The combination of these two platforms gives scientists a more comprehensive and faster path to researching some of the most challenging diseases affecting mankind. Seahorse will be incorporated into Agilent’s financials starting in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. In Q4, Agilent started shipping the new 1290 Infinity II Vialsampler, as well as the 600-bar 1260 Infinity version. At the BCEIA Conference in Beijing, we introduced the Agilent 5977B High-Efficiency Source GC/MSD System, a tandem gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer that delivers lower levels of detection than any other instrument in its class.  We also introduced the 4200 TapeStation system. This fully automated instrument enables scientists to rapidly analyze up to 96 DNA samples at a time, and sets a new sample QC standard for next-gen sequencing; and we also launched several targeted solutions, such as our GC QTOF Pesticide Analysis Solution, and our LC QTOF Water Analysis System. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group delivered another strong quarter, with core revenue growth of 11% in Q4. Both services and consumables experienced strong growth across all geographies. Operating margin was 25.1% for the quarter, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Customers are benefitting from ACG’s new brand promise to deliver insights that lead to outcomes. In Q4, Agilent University introduced an enhanced portfolio of online training courses. This enables customers from lab technicians to researchers, to develop new skills and gain insights that can improve economic, operational and scientific outcomes for their laboratories. The launch of the online training has exceeded our expectations.  In consumables, we introduced a new product to help food-safety labs test high-fat samples more accurately. The Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid removes matrix interferences that have made test results challenging to reproduce. This gives food-safety labs a better way to address what has been one of their most challenging tasks.  Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to build momentum in Q4, delivering 10% core revenue growth and strength across all of its businesses. Target enrichment was particularly strong, while Dako Omnis once again had record shipments and it continues to gain competitive wins.  DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 19.2%, up 430 basis points from a year ago. In the fourth quarter, two new diagnostics products from DGG received FDA approval. The first product was created in partnership with Merck & Co. This new companion diagnostic test can reveal whether a patient with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is likely to respond to Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA.  The second product is our first complementary diagnostic developed in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. This new test can identify PD-L1 expression levels on the surface of non-small-cell lung cancer tumor cells, and provide information on the survival benefit with OPDIVO for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. Now, let’s take a brief look at Agilent’s revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continue to see ongoing strength in the pharma, diagnostics and clinical markets, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptick and healthy demand across the spectrum.  Applied end-market performance was led by continued growth in food and environmental and chemical & energy were flat on a core basis. As we noted in our Q3 call, customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in light of weakening commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economy. Geographically, we saw core revenue growth across all regions led by the U.S. and Asia, excluding Japan.  Now let me provide some additional insight on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program launched in Q2 is re-engineering the company to be more nimble and efficient. In fiscal 2015 our actions delivered about $40 million in gross savings. In addition, the NMR closed resulted in $15 million in savings, and our Agilent Order fulfillment organization delivered on its $25 million committed savings.  We remain on track to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY17, a 4 point improvement over FY14, exclusive of company split dis-synergies. At the same time we continue to invest in long-term revenue growth. Our results over the past three quarters give us confidence in our ability to deliver on this longer-term operating margin expansion commitment. We are pleased with the operational results for our first year as the New Agilent Technologies, and our ability to meet our external earnings commitments for the full year.  Now I want to tell you about how we think about our guidance. We are committed to achieving our long-term financial goals. At the same time, we will be more conservative in our guidance. This is especially prudent due to macro-market concerns that have developed since I spoke with many of you at our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting. Before turning the call over to Didier, I want to recap a few highlights of our first year as the New Agilent Technologies. This was a transformational year for the company. We successfully completed the CEO transition. We formed a new executive leadership team that is deeply committed to delivering results. We have also implemented a new company strategy, restructured the company’s operations and product portfolio, and committed to new long-term financial goals. Despite all this change and moving pieces, we have delivered growth and increasing profitability over the past three quarters.  Let me close with a few comments about the future. We are making acquisitions such as Cartagenia and Seahorse, expanding our presence in served life sciences and diagnostics markets. Our pipeline of new offerings has never been stronger. I am convinced we have an energized, aligned team at Agilent that will deliver on our full potential. I remain quite confident in our long-term prospects of above-market growth, increasing profitability levels, and greater shareholder value. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our FY16 guidance. Didier. Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year performance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.2% and 6.4% respectively, and our operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight was 21.9% and 19.6% respectively.  Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Keysight spinoff, our operating margin was up 240 basis points in Q4 and up 170 basis points for the full year. We are therefore well on our way to deliver on the committed 400 basis points improvement in adjusted operating margin by fiscal year ‘17. Our hedging strategy, consisting of both structural and systematic financial hedges was put to the test this year and delivered very well. Thanks to structural hedging stemming from our global footprint, flow-through was just 20% and we also gained $18 million from our systematic cash flow hedges.  Turning to capital returns and cash flow for the year, we returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks and generated $491 million in operating cash flow. We did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter, but we intend to repurchase this quarter, subject to customary conditions. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year ‘16 revenue guidance of $4.15 billion to $4.17 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0% to 4.5%. It is based on October 30 exchange rates and takes into account the Cartagenia and Seahorse acquisitions, as well as the XRD divestiture and NMR exit. We expect currency will have a 1.7% negative impact on revenues.  Regarding XRD and NMR, fiscal year ‘15 revenues were $58 million and fiscal year ‘16 revenues are expected to be $12 million. We project fiscal year ‘16 EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.91, growing 6% to 10 %, based on an adjusted operating margin of 20.0% to 20.5%. You will notice that we are projecting a narrow revenue and EPS range at this time. We believe that 4.3% core revenue growth and 20.3% adjusted operating margin are the proper midpoints, taking into account both the present macroeconomic environment and our operating margin commitments. With those midpoints, we want to set the low end of our guidance in line with our commitments. Having set those at 4.0% core revenue growth and 20% adjusted operating margin, the high-end of the guidance naturally falls out at 4.5% core revenue growth and 20.5% adjusted operating margin. As you adjust your models for fiscal year ‘16, please consider the following nine points; first, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2015. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $57 million and as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $22 million. Depreciation is projected to be – that is the third point, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth point, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Fifth, we plan to return approximately $635 million in capital to shareholders, including $155 million in dividends and $480 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Six, as communicated at the Analyst and Investor Day in May, we plan to borrow $250 million around February to fund a portion of our buyback program. Seven, net interest expense is forecasted at $68 million, and other income at $7 million, including $12 million billed to Keysight. Eight, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 328 million shares, 7 million less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year ’15. And ninth and last, we expect operating cash flow of $650 million and capital expenditures of $140 million, $42 million over fiscal year ‘15 as we embark on a two-year program to significantly increase the capacity of our nucleic acid facilities.  Now, finally moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1 billion to $1.02 billion and EPS of $0.42 to $0.44. At midpoint, revenue will grow 3.5% year-over-year on a core basis, and EPS will grow 5%. As customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. Thank you . And our first question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.  Good afternoon, thanks very much. I think you guys mentioned in the script a couple of times the fact that you are taking a more conservative approach to guidance this year. So Mike, wondering if could just put a little more color around how your process around guidance has changed this year. Just want to get a better appreciation for what you guys are doing different when it comes to planning for guidance? Yes, thanks Isaac. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on our philosophy around the thinking behind the guidance. As you know I mentioned earlier, this is the first year the New Agilent Technologies. It is also my first year in the CEO seat and I had a chance to reflect on how we have guided the company over the last year.  And what I decided to do was really take a, if you will a more prudent and conservative outlook to our guidance and a couple of factors were in my thinking. One is, first the world has really changed since May when we spoke to the group about the longer term outlook for the company’s growth and the macro outlook has come a lot more challenging since then.  We’ve seen IMF grow on the GDP and some of our larger chemical customers who have taken down their outlook for ’16 and I thought just bringing down the guidance of bid in terms of the top-line mid-point or half point or so was a prudent way to plan for the company. We’ll take a look at the business as it develops over the quarter or two, but really wanted to take a more prudent and conservative outlook into 2016.  I will also remind you that we are not altering our commitments to achieving our 22% operating margin by 2017 and then the number of the conversations over the last several months, we’ve indicated that we can make those margin improvements even at a 4% top line revenue growth scenario. And then maybe just one final note here, as a reminder when we provide guidance, our internal plans are always higher and that’s our executives are compensated within the company.  Okay, thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on a couple of details. One would be, can you disclose a growth rate in China this quarter and secondly, in DDG it looks like gross margin was down a little bit sequentially on a higher based of revenue than you had in fiscal 3Q, so I’m just wondering what\\'s going on in that business. Thank you. Sure, how about if I go ahead and make some commentary on China, then Jacob if you can chime in on the DDG specific questions. So, the results came in China just as we expected. We exited the year in mid-single digit growth rate for the year. Finished the year very strongly in China and we do this as a source of growth for the company. I think you may really, we I think are one of the first to call an early return to growth about this time last year.  For me whether it goes to mid to high single digit range, it will really be depended on what happens in the chemical and energy space. That really is the wildcard I think for our overall growth rate in China next year. But the business developed as forecasted and we are quite pleased with how we ended the year. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Jacob on the DGG question.  Yes, hi Isaac. Yes, you’re right that our gross margin came down a little bit and it’s really due to the mix that we in Q3 had higher number of ratings and we had a little bit higher number of instruments in Q4. But that’s just the variability between the quarters and nothing you can say fundamentally has changed.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Good afternoon guys. So I guess, as you think about sort of the key delta you started – stick on the guidance topic, but the key dealt sort of today versus the Analyst Day or even versus where you were maybe a month or two ago, where would you sort of point out the significant assumption changes were? Weather it was top line and then can you just flow that through, because it does look like still even though you are delivering on the multiyear cost, the next year operating margin targets are a bit lower.  And then if you have any sense of where the delta is versus the street, because in our math based on the consensus it looks like there was a bit higher of other income assumption. So we are just trying to figure out if that was one of the deltas again versus maybe what the market was looking for? Yes, thanks Ross. I appreciate the question. So relative to how your thinking has evolved since the May, I think I would point to two things; one is the chemical and energy space. This is the fourth quarter in a row for us in terms of flat growth and now it’s still a robudence  in our environmental business because we are really not getting the same volume and that was associated with the fracking in the U.S. That’s the one where we’ve kind of pushed out the timing in terms of the return of growth. The business is holding steady, but is not yet to a growth trajectory.  So I think point one would be kind of a longer timeline in terms of the return to growth in the chemical and energy sector and then the other one is the impact, what we are seeing in some of the emerging economics, Brazil, Russia continue to be quite weak for us, albeit we have good strength in India and as I mentioned earlier China. And I think third was just an outlook of being a little bit more conservative and prudent on our overall guidance assumptions. And Didier, I think Ross’s math is correct on other income, but would you like to add some comments on that.  Yes Ross, we are looking at the – we also analyzed the delta versus the consensus and it seems to come from a little bit from the revenue side, probably not taking into account the reduction due to RPD, so a little bit on that. A little bit on the operating margin percentage and a quite significant number surprisingly on other income and expense.  And I must say, you are the only one who nailed that number exactly, precisely and we’ve seen that in other cases quite significant differences in other income and expense. And I remind everybody that especially net interest expense this year we incurred $59 million. We say that we are going to borrow $250 million. We have modeled to borrow it at the middle of February and therefore we’ll add about $9 million of interest expense. So basically I think those were the main factors. All right, great. And I guess maybe secondarily, so I feel it’s unusual you guys didn’t buy any stock in the quarter. Can you give us a sort of sense? It seems like the assumption is that will obviously occur in ’16. Give us a sense for why that was? Was it Seahorse, was it something else, and then it looked like free cash came in a little bit below or a reasonable amount below what you were looking for. Can you just walk us through sort of where that delta was versus kind of what you laid out? Hey Ross, this is Mike. Well I’ll go ahead and handle the first part of the question and then I’ll bounce it back to you Didier for the second part of the Ross’s question. So hey Ross, I do really appreciate the question, but we are not really in a position to comment on the circumstances around the stock repurchases in to Q4. But I would remind you is that are going to resume repurchase this quarter and as Didier mentioned in his remarks, I believe we are targeting $480 million of repurchases in 2016. And Didier can you address the second quarter.  Yes, on the cash flow basis your correct. When we started the year, we talked about $600 million of operating cash flow and now we are at $500 million. But already at the Analyst Day we had adjusted that number, although we provided a number excluding one-time items, but it was if I recall $555 million and since then I mean we’ve been exactly in line with the commitment. So the number is about $500 million. The reason why it’s down from the initial estimate is mostly related to currency, mostly that’s what it is. And again, we are in line with our commitment since the analysis day.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of, John Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. Great, thanks. Mike, on the outlook again, I know you are no longer commenting explicitly on orders and backlog like you were previously. But as you go into next year, was there anything from an orders standpoint that gives you a little bit more caution in ‘16 or is it just the dynamics you just read previously, wanted to be a little bit more conservative? Thank you John and I do really appreciate the question, but as we mentioned previously, we are no longer reporting on coming in orders. But I would say that the guidance reflects of you, of conservatism, not any concerns on the order front. Okay, and then last one for me, if you look at the Life Science & Applied Markets Group, I think the operating margin there was down 20 basis points. Can you maybe just dig into a little bit more detail about that business? Sure, thanks Mike. Regarding the operating margin you have to realize that we first and foremost had all sort of dis-synergies of this plate, which brought us down about a 1% compared to last year. And then if we look at the product mix that we have this quarter, it was a little bit different that the quarters before in terms of we had less cheesy, given the exposure we had in the oil industry, in the chemical and energy market and a little bit while other pieces in spectroscopy came up. So product mix had also a minor impact, but the biggest one you have seen is probably through there, because of the dis-synergies.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.  Yes, thanks for the question there. First one for me is on the academic and government in the market. I guess you talked about a spending pause in the U.S. Can you give us a little more color there? I guess when did that happen and what do you see in other geographies in terms of academic and government?  Sure, thanks, happy to take it. So as Mike alluded to first, it was tough compared to last year. This is one of the major reasons why it has been flat or slightly negative this quarter. And we had also lower spending in the US, it was softer than we had expected especially in September. For a very specific month we have seen smaller deals and our customers are a little bit more cautious given the budget uncertainties they have seen in some areas. So looking forward we actually . Got it. And how about other geographies like Japan. I guess what do you see in the academic and government funding their?  Well, on a worldwide base I would say is what we have seen is that it was more solid in Europe and in China and Japan it was also flat for the last quarter. So the biggest impact we have seen was definitely in the U.S.  Okay, and then one more from me. On the forensics side, you referenced timing of some larger deals I guess. What happened there and can you quantify how big the impact was? Yes, well the growth for forensic was in the low single digit for the quarter, yes. Which one do you mean it now? Yes, just earlier in the prepared remarks I guess in the deck you talked about forensic being muted by the timing of the larger deals. Yes, I’m just kind of curious on what happened in terms of the timing and how big those larger deals were. What was the impact? You mean, okay for the deals in the US. Again, last year given we had these double digit growth, it was based on several large deals we had. Those large deals, we haven’t seen the same magnitude this year, this is what I wanted to say. So they were smaller compared to last year. This is also brought the overall growth down in the U.S. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. I think I’ll stick with the guidance if you wouldn’t mind. Could you maybe breakdown expectations for the three main segments next year? I mean effectively in our models right now we’re essentially having the organic growth rate that you guys reported in 2015. So if you could kind of help us source maybe where we should modify some expectations, I think that would be pretty helpful. Sure Dane, I’ll be happy to. So as we looked at the growth assumptions by end markets, I think the biggest one I think will be chemical energy, which is as you know 25% of the company and we’re assuming flat for the entire year.  The applied markets low single digit growth, higher for food, but really no growth in the environmental side of that segment and then as Patrick mentioned earlier, government and academia in the low single digits, pharma high single digits and the diagnosis and the clinical markets are also high single digits. So you can see there’s quite a mix between the pharma and diagnostics market of differential versus the chemical energy space. So if we flow that through the model, I think where we might have a little trouble is looking at 2016. So we give about – take everything together about 3% top-line growth to get to that $4.16 billion. To get to the operating profit line of about 20 spot to five or spot two if you wanted the brand, that’s about a 60% plus variable margin, which seems a bit high given you can kind of go back in history, and I think even in kind of coming out of a trough year in 2010 it was still about 55%. And then when we flow that through to 2017 to kind of hit the targets, you are talking about another 60% variable margin.  Can you kind of help us in line with where you guys laid out your analyst day and reiterated in the presentation here, how to get to that 22% operating margin in 2017, because it’s I guess looking pretty aggressive at the moment. Yes, I mean there’s a lot of moving parts, but nothing has fundamentally changed, except that we exceeded our first year opening margin expansion goal basically achieving 170 basis points. So we are now one year or three up, 43% of our goal. So we are a little bit ahead of what we had committed to and as stated by Mike, we certainly didn’t want to assume a second fantastic year like this one or at least provide that as a guidance at this place, at this time and decided to have a guidance that is somehow conservative.  But nothing has fundamentally changed, but the moving parts are really I mean like this. I mean the salary increases, I mean all the different components, the new trends to our projections regarding the benefits from the NMR exit, from the Agile Agilent program, from the fact that we have the FDA warning there behind us, the OSS, the order fulfillment annual improvement, there’s really no chance. The only chance I would say is a positive chance we’re slightly ahead of the game at the end of Tier 1. Yes Dane, if I could just add some additional comments here too. So we’re really quite pleased with how we performed this first year. I think we’re well in that trajectory to 22% and finally we found a way to get there even if we got a little bit lower on the top line revenue.  I also would say that part of our thinking was influenced by many of our major systems infrastructure programs, which I think I’ve talked to you in the past around the Agile Agilent. These are multiyear programs and a lot of them will start hitting into the end of 2016. So we started to get the real big million dollar cost savings coming out of our infrastructure in ’17. So we’re right on our plan, in fact ahead of our internal plan. So we’re quite confident in our ability to get to that 22, but there are some timing issues related to some of our major, major programs.  Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Mike, we focused a lot here on the impact of chem and energy. I wonder if we could think about a couple of potential catalyst to the upside; one is NIH budgets. And to what extent are you thinking about the possibility of stronger funding for the NIH and if the NIH gets something like a plus five for 2016, what does that mean for your business? Yes, let me make some general comments and then if you have anything specific to add onto that, Patrick that would be great. Clearly if the NIH funding would go up, that would be a positive for the business, albeit I think as Patrick will share, it’s not a huge part of the overall funding for our company, but that will be positive news and that’s also as I said earlier, we’ll watch the business for the next quarter or two and kind of see where things go. So if these positive developments happen, it will be reflected in our view of the outlook for the business.  But what we did want to do is plan on a lot of good news now given some of the uncertainty of either budgets being finalized or where some of these end markets and economies are going. And Patrick, I can’t remember the exact percentage of our funding to NIH. So maybe you can add a little color there as well. Well, I don’t have the exact funding, but I agree with you that we didn’t bake in numbers like the ones have just been mentioned, certainly not the 5% they are going at low single digit projections on the budgets. So if there is upside, we’ll be happy to take it. Okay, thanks for that. And then just one for Jacob. I\\'m sorry, if you wouldn’t mind, could you give just us a bit more granularity on the performance of Dako in the quarter. I’m not sure if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you give a growth rate and any additional color on the driver and dynamics, whether they are competitive or otherwise really appreciative? Thanks so much. Hey Steve, as you know we don’t provide insight on the individual divisions, but I can say that we continue to see strong performance in our pathology business and this continues to break records in placements and that obviously is driving the growth there. So we see great growth there in our companion diagnostic business, with all the activities around the recent launches within the PDL-1, it’s also a great growth driver. So overall I see great momentum in the businesses, but the actual number I cannot comment on. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you. I wanted to drill down on the pharma and biotech end markets a little bit, and the strongest growth for you this year last year and it sounds like next year that expectation is that it would continue to be your strongest grower. Can you talk about some of the technologies that you are seeing being the strongest drivers of that growth and how you are addressing that market and also I\\'d like to hear about whether this is big pharma, is it small midsize pharma, is a contract labs, what kind of clients are you seeing driving the growth? Thanks. Yes, so these are several questions at once. So let me start with the platforms that drive the growth. Actually we had very competitive platforms for the pharmaceutical and the biopharmaceutical markets. The biggest growth driver right comes actually out of the LC business, which drives a lot of replacement business off the installed basis.  You probably know we had more than   systems installed worldwide. A lot of them are in the pharma space and the offering we have today with the Infinity II series gives a seamless replacement of the systems which have a much higher performance, better efficiency, so a huge improvement from our customers. So that resonates well and it resonates actually well across the board, whether its smaller pharma or large pharma. The large deals of course come mainly out of the large pharmas and we have seen several big deals in the U.S., as well as in Europe in the last quarter. The second piece of the question was regarding biopharma. In biopharma we see actually higher growth moving forward than in small molecule pharma and we continue to address this also with more specific solutions around our LCMS portfolio and some of it also in the spectroscopy space.  So I think we have a very attractive portfolio for our customers. We have a lot of good new releases. This year out with the 6470 Triple-Quad system which is well received from pharma as well and they will continue to drive growth for us in this space. And Patrick, if I can just add one final comment here. Tim, your focused on the technologies driving a lot of the growth in our reported pharma results, but also call your attention to the Agilent CrossLab group who delivered another double digit growth in the fourth quarter and we’re seeing strong demand for our services in consumables CrossLab services and consumables in the pharma as well as our technology offerings. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Maybe just to follow-up on the pharma. I mean you guys have been trending along the 6% to 8% growth, but the 19% growth really stands out. Was there anything one-time that you saw this quarter on the pharma business that you can call on? Tycho you broke up a bit. I think what you asked was we had put up double digit growth and was anything of a one-time nature in this most recent quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the question. Yes, I mean you have been kind of growing pharma 6% to 8%, so 19% was certainly notable. So was there anything you can call out that was unique to the quarter? No, we had several quarters in a row where we had double digit growth in pharma, so it’s really and as Mike said, moving forward we see it continue to grow into high single digits at least. Okay, and then for Didier, I’m just trying to understand the explanation on the free cash flow down 20% in six months relative to what you said at the end of May, currency hasn’t really moved. So I’m just trying to understand the explanation there. So since in May we provided the number at the Analyst and Investor Day, just taking away all the one-time cash outflows that we had during the year, which are related to the separations deal where we had to pay a lot of invoices related to the separation and also, I think about $50 million of taxes that were related to the separation also.  So my point was just the number that we have now is even better, because it is the number that includes those elements, even better than the 555 that we provided that excluded those elements. So we have a better operating cash flow than we projected in May, however it is not as good as the one as we projected back in November of the previous year and mostly related to currency. Okay, and then last one just capital deployment. You highlighted Seahorse and Cartagenia, should we assume deals of similar magnitude going forward or do you have an appetite to potentially do something a little bit larger? Yes, we’ve talked about it at the Analyst and Investor Day of potentially two deals of the size of Seahorse per annum. Obviously it could be slightly bigger, but we were not looking at any larger deals in the short term, but we are ready to take on the two deals of that size per year perhaps, slightly bigger. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. So a couple of questions. First of all, could you talk about the academic? I\\'m a little bit surprised just given that some of your competitors like Sterno have a much bigger academic exposure, basically didn\\'t call it anything unusual in September. So could you talk a little bit more about that and particularly what did you see in October since you guys got a little bit longer. No, I’ll take that again. Again the compare for us this quarter was mainly a difficult compare, because we had a strong Q4 last year with double digit growth with some exceptional large deals in this space. The pause or the slowdown we have seen in September, where they usually have low budget release to some extent came back in October, so we’ve seen for the year and we are on track with what we project in the low to mid single digit growth rate for academia and government. Got you, but I just wanted the clarity, thank you. And could you give a little bit more color. I mean your 4.25% core growth, what are you sort of looking for core growth in each of the segment; LS, DX, at CrossLab?  So yes, we are not providing the projections per segment, however I will tell you and that won’t surprise you that our instrument segment LSAG will have slightly lower than the average and our other two segments Agilent CrossLab and DGG will have higher growth rate than the average. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, could you talk about the level of visibility in the budgets and chemical and energy end market and just do you feel like things have begun to bottom out now after a few quarters in the exploration business? I can take this, yes. So you’re actually right. We see currently marketing really bottoming out, so we don’t expect any major further declines on the exploration side, which gives us confidence that the growth rate that Mike projected and being in the low single digits combined chemical energy should also materialize moving forward. We are now like four to five quarters in this situation with the low oil price and we had been mainly hit in the first couple of quarters on the exploration side and now we see this really bottoming out. Got it, that’s helpful. And then just one more on the deal environment, just curious if you had any updated thoughts on the cash that your holding overseas. Thanks. Yes, I mean we have about $200 million of cash we had at the end of October in the U.S., plus $235 million in escrow for the Seahorse, which was put to good use on November 1. The rest of the cash is overseas. We’ve had a good year in terms of being able to repatriate some of that overseas cash into the U.S., that’s why we ended there with $435 million about and we are looking for continued support to bring back some of the cash tax effectively, but you feel most of the cash that we generate is overseas. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good evening. Most of my questions have been addressed already, but Mike, just one for you on the decision to expand the capacity of the nucleic acid solutions business. You clearly speak to the drivers of that decision and exactly where capacity utilization is today and what the, I guess P&L effects in terms of growth, the implications are in 2017, around that. Brandon, thanks. I’d love to take that call. It’s a great story and I think I’ll allow Jacob the pleasure of responding to that one. Yes, thank you. So as you know our nuclear gases solution division is manufacturing oligos for active pharmaceutical ingredients and we have seen a significant demand for those products over the last few years and we continue to see demand that actually is beyond our current capacity, and therefore we’ve decided to invest in expanding that capacity over the next few years and this is actually what has been reflected in that buy. This activity will set in the DGG business. Brandon, this is Mike again. The beauty of this business is we will get long term customer commitments for purchase volumes and then you’ll start to see this show up in a very significant amount of revenue as you get in the outer years like ’17 and ’18 for the company. That’s helpful, and then Didier, just one clarification. Did you say that you’ve embedded the mid to high single-digit growth outcome for China for ’16, was that right? I think that was me. I said we were expecting mid single digit growth in China and what could happen Brandon, kind of what happened in the chemical and energy, we could see that get to high single digit growth as an overall market. Just some additional color here. We expect the pharma, the food and environmental segments to continue to be quite strong as an end market, along with continued interest in the services and consumables. Again the wildcard that will lure us between the two estimate points would be what growth rate we would see in the chemical and energy space, but it looks like a solid growth market for us year and then again what happens to chemical and energy, we could see more end market growth than what we are projecting now.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on this last comment here. On China and the chemical and energy business, have you seen that deteriorate further or how are the orders tracking in that business given the macro headwinds coming out of China? Yes Miro, this is Mike, thanks for the question. Although we don’t specifically comment on orders, what I can just refer you to is your overall view of the results for the quarter in a revenue standpoint and its four quarters in a row are flat. I believe earlier Patrick used the comments that we think we bottomed out and I think that applies to China as well. Sounds good, thank you for that comment. Secondly, just given the sort of mixed end market environment for you. Wondering how are you prioritizing your investments for fiscal ‘16? Has anything changed in terms of your thinking there as well as the level of investment you devote to each of the end markets? Great question, and I think as you know we try to align our investments to where we see the best growth prospects. But I have to say that the market has been fairly consistent in terms of how it’s developed relative to our internal view of where to place our bets and I’d say no. I don’t think there’s any really fundamental changes to our investments and technology front or in places where we are building out our channel coverage.  Okay, sounds good. And lastly, for Didier, the negative 1.7% of currency you see next year, what kind of flow-through should we assume on EPS? Similar to what we have seen in 2015, so about 20%. We think that currency will have an impact of about $68 million for the year and the impact on the operating profit is about 14, 15.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. So based on what I am hearing from a lot of folks who are listening to this call, I think there is a little bit of a debate as to how to view your guidance. I think that’s a clear observation at this point.  So Mike, you acknowledge previously that you maybe should have guided ‘15 to maybe slightly more conservative levels and now we have fiscal ‘16 guidance and like I just said I think a lot of folks are trying to figure out how much of this guide is you swinging to the other extreme, which seems pretty prudent for a variety of reasons, including the macro backdrop or is there something fundamental you are seeing as giving your reason for a pause. So if I could just, as we are kind of getting into the end of this call, take another shot at asking a couple of questions?  The first would be your guidance implies that margin will expand, operating margin will expand by 50 to 100 basis points this year and then 150 to 200 basis points in fiscal ‘17, if I’m doing the math right. How much is that dependent on a favorable changes in revenue mix relative to recent trends?  The second question would be recognizing a key focus area for you Mike has been to bring much of what you successfully did with Chemical Analysis to broader Agilent. Is the variable cost structure progressing to the point where you still feel comfortable that you can get to that 22% margin target in fiscal ’17, even if core revenue growth is, say, 4% to 4.5% the next couple of years.  The third question would be getting at really the question of fundamental demand and recognizing you don’t want to get into book-to-bill’s for the reasons that your outlined previously. To be fair, a lot of your peers do comment at least on demand coming out of the quarter, heading into the end of the quarter. Given the performance and LSAG it seems like it would be helpful for you guys to at least say something about trends there.  And the last one would be, Tycho asked a question about free cash flow guidance for fiscal ’16. To be more specific, at your Analyst Day you guided us to expect $620 million in free cash flow this year. Your guidance is now for $510 million. So FX has changed, but really only a little bit and I know there a lot of one timers in there. But a $110 million is a big delta. Can you just walk us through what’s going on there? Thank you. Sure Dough, these are very important questions. So I appreciate the opportunity to add some additional clarity. So if I miss anything please come back to me, but I think I’ve got the key points here. One is, let’s start with the view of 22%, how depended it is on a higher level of revenue.  As I may have indicated earlier in a call its 4%, 4.5%, we will make the 22% operating profit in 2017. And I say that with a lot of confidence, because of the results we have put up over the last three quarters, plus I know we have a number of major programs that we have to deliver on their projected cost savings. You start to see those near the tail-end of ’16 going into ’17. They are completely independent of revenue.  We are assuming no significant change of revenue mix beyond what we have shared at the Analyst Day and also what you saw in the results. We do expect our ACG and DGG Groups to grow faster than LSAG, but LSAG will also grow. We do expect our non-instrument product lines to grow faster.  And in terms of the commentary, we saw no real change in fundamental demand coming through and existing the quarter. The comments we made about revenue I think speak directly to how we saw the quarter develop, and again back to how you made it all off a question. I mean part of it is a reflection on 2015 guidance and also the fact that we do want to be prudent out the gate and a little bit more conservative. It’s still early in the year, and there are couple of things that are trying to handicap in terms of what’s going on with chemical and energy, how will the emerging markets hold up in some of the economic concerns they have.  But I would not at all take this as a lack of confidence in the business going forward or any kind of significant last quarter changes. In fact we are really, really pleased with the way the year closed, the numbers we put up and how they closed off our first year.  So Didier, I’m going to let you handle the last questing of the bridge between the free cash flow of 620 to... Well, so in the past I had talked about 2015 and the fact that we ended about high free cash flow that what I had motioned at the time, and the reason why you don’t – I mean we are not comparing apple-to-apple is just because of the one-time expenses. So if you want doing the follow-up calls and I will do that with each of you. We can go over the one-time items and the impact those have. That’s probably the best to do. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe just two quick ones for me on NMR. Mike, how removed are you at this point from that business, and from the servicing of your customers there and then Didier, can you just touch on what you are assuming for operating profit improvement in 2016 for NMR?  Sure, relative to NMR, as you know we excited the NMR hardware business but have maintained the service relationship and that continues to go very well in terms of our ability to service and support our customers and it’s really a major part of our thinking when we closed down the hardware business. But we really wanted to preserve and mitigate the impact of our customers. So we are in a position to be able to handle their long term service needs. And Didier, I think you’ve got some specifics on the expectations for next year.  Yes, there is no change to the guidance that we have provided. We had about $15 million of cost reductions and expense reduction in fiscal year ’15. Next year we anticipate an additional $5 million, in line with what we had previously stated.  And I think you guided Didier some revenue flow through as we work-off the last part of the backlog in ’16. So there will still be some.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.  Thanks Paul. I appreciate the opportunity to answer. Great, great question. So we see the U.S. as a real area of strength, albeit some of the commentary around what may happen in terms of the chemical energy space and how its impacting the U.S. business. So we see the market there being very robust and was a source of strength for the company for the quarter and for the year. So we are looking forward to continued strength in the U.S.  And I think the same call in Europe and Europe holds as well. I think part of our European business the report has been – it includes some of the Middle East and Eastern European courtiers and would have been a little bit of a challenge for us, particularly in the chemical and energy space. But overall Western Europe and Germany in particular has been extremely strong for us and we are seeing no indication of that is changing for us in our European based business.  And then lastly when you look at the energy sector, I know there is a lot of pieces like gas Chromatography and Spectroscopy on the metals mining side, but weren’t you already seeing that market pretty soft in the earlier quarters of this fiscal year Mike and I guess the short question is it’s been weak already, has it not? Yes, that’s correct Paul and you hit the right categories where it really affects our gas Chromatography business where we have such a strong position in that segment. I think that was one of the mix issues that Patrick had alluded to earlier. And then in the metals and mining, that’s where we really have seen a slowdown as it relates to our Spectroscopy business.  So you might look at say in 2016 that we could see some reported revenues versus easy compares, but we’ll wait till we call it in. But again, we think that it looks like to us that the market may have bottoms and that perhaps the worst is behind us.  Right, you have been through a few cycles yourself running that division. I mean what does the market feel like? You sense the bottom in some of these categories? Yes, I mean we think so. I mean customers are starting to talk about the new technologies and replacement, particularly as it relates to data systems and associated systems. Some of the customers are still fairly conservative. You know BASF was out with a downgrade in term of their outlook for ’16. But at the same point in time, the equipment is required to keep their facilities running at the highest levels of operational efficiency, so there is an active funnel. So we now are seeing to start closing some business.  Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Your line is now open. Thank you; two quick ones. One Didier, is there anything you would like to call out on the quarterly cadence in 2016 as we consider our models. I mean presumably Q3 is going to be a very difficult comparison.  And then secondly for Jacob, is there any effort or plan to migrate a couple of these companion diagnostic approval to the ominous system. I looked like they were approved on your older Autostainer. Thank you.  So on the first question, Dan we will have the usual higher operating margin in the second half than in the first half based on volume and also because on the actions that we are taking throughout the year, which will have a more of an impact in terms of cost and expense reduction, already in the second half because of the carry over impact. So you should see a fairly steady ramp in operating margin throughout the year, very much in line with the usual seasonality and the pattern. One Didier, one additional thought here might be looking at Q2, Q3 revenue year-over-year and that we had some logistical start up issues in our Q2 where we have some track revenue. Hey Dan, let me address the other question also. So you asked about the right that we developed the PD-L1 for the Autostainers right now, and the reason is that these activates is ongoing for many years also, so we start off with the Autostainers packing base, where we also have the highest installed base. But your absolutely right that we are actively also moving it over to the Ominous and will clear have our full portfolio on the Ominous going forward, including our companion diagnostics, so that will happen.  Thank you Sabrina and on behalf of the management team, I’d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to give us call on IR and I’d like to end by wishing everybody a good day. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you for joining us on today\\'s call. I\\'m pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings above the high-end of our guidance. I will now highlight three key results. First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year. Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical, and diagnostics markets with a return to growth in Academia & Government. Market demand remains strong for Liquid Chromatography, CrossLab\\'s services and consumables, and Diagnostics and Genomics offerings. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. Let me highlight the Q1 results by our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return on Academia & Government markets, and China government investment in Environmental and Food markets. All this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the Chemical & Energy market space. LSAG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent. LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released two new refracted index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food applications. Agilent\\'s innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an innovation award for our unique LC dual-needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent\\'s LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultra-low carryover. Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and Chemical & Energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offerings. Operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continue to bring novel new chemistries to market. For example, we\\'ve released advanced Bio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size-exclusion chromatography, targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continues to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rates. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing rev for new PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum. Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets and the favorable compares. DGG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%. That\\'s up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015. Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s, OPDIVO, was approved by the FDA for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved expanded use of this PD-L1 diagnostics to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved tests for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers. Now I\\'ll take a brief look at Agilent\\'s revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our Clinical and Diagnostics revenue was up 7% and we experienced a return to growth in Academia & Government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S. Applied end-market performance was generally soft except for Environmental, which was up 9% driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our Food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical & Energy declined 2% driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns. Let me provide an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving a sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategies. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we call this One Agilent. As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here\\'s what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S. defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I\\'ve also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start of the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook. The principle of new Agilent is to be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end-markets and emerging economies. The good news is that we see solid market conditions in other end-markets and geographies. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course corrections as market conditions dictate. We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior-year introductions, we have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem with these new offerings, we are creating a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us. And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win in the marketplace. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier? Yes. Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high-end of our revenue and EPS guidance, even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million. The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. I\\'ll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2016 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last two weeks, we\\'ve seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance. Turning to our share buyback program, we remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before our fiscal year-end. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we\\'re expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1. The midpoint corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.37 to $0.39. Hi. This is Ryan Blicker filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Starting with operating margin guidance, it seems as though you reduced full-year guidance by about 10 basis points, but it seems as though most of that was FX. Can you confirm that that was all due to FX, or are there other changes we should be thinking about? No. It was entirely due to FX, absolutely. As I mentioned, the FX impact was $13 million and that is precisely the amount of the reduction in operating profit reflected in our guidance. And we have maintained the guidance at 20.2%, which was the average of 20% to 25% that we had guided to in November. No change. Okay. Thank you. And looking at the pharma end-market, obviously, another very strong performance in the quarter. Can you give us more details on what drove the strength and were there any one-time dynamics like a budget flush or pull-forward of revenue? And, I guess, lastly, do you still expect growth in this end-market to approximate high-single-digits for the full-year? Thank you. Hey, Ryan. This is Mike. Let me make a few comments on the pharma strength we saw in the first quarter. Clearly, no one-time events and we saw great pacing throughout the quarter. I just would highlight a few points here. One, we\\'re seeing a strong growth in Liquid Chromatography both in terms of the uptake and our new products, but also the technology refresh that is underway within the segment. Also, customers are responding quite positively to our biopharma solutions. And across the board, between biopharma and pharma, we\\'re seeing strong demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. 19% growth for the first quarter. We don\\'t expect that level of double-digit growth to continue all through the year, but we\\'re quite confident in our projections of high-single-digit. We\\'re calling for 8% overall growth for the year in pharma. So we see no signs that this market won\\'t remain robust for us for the rest of this year. Regarding the guidance of EPS, I know when you guided last time the euro had already fallen relative to the dollar. So are you measuring the euro on today\\'s exchange rate, last week\\'s exchange rate? I mean, could you flush out a little bit more? Yeah. Hi, Paul. So the guidance is always based on the exchange rate on the last day of the quarter we report. So the new guidance is based on the exchange rate as of January 30 of 2016. And it was between November – October 30, which was a November guidance and then January 30, which is the present guidance. The dollar strengthened, but we are seeing it weakening since November 30 a little bit vis-à-vis the euro, and certainly, vis-à-vis the yen. So if that continues, it will be reflected in our May guidance. Again, there was no change at all to our November guidance except for those that result directly from the change in exchange rates between October 30 and January 30. Yeah, Paul, if I can just emphasize that again, I mean, the fundamental assumptions we made that underlined our prior quarter guidance remain intact with the exception being FX. And then, lastly, Mike, what stands out on technology is the PD-L1 approval and also the large molecule technology in CrossLab, do you sit there with those two products on your menu thinking there\\'s a bias toward more organic? Or where are you at with those two that you mentioned? Paul, just to make sure I understand the question relative to -thanks for the comments and observations. Just to make sure I understand the question, this would be relative to our expectation of continued organic growth of those two new... Yeah. Are they enough to move the needle higher than what you would have thought 90 days ago on last guide? Well, let me make a comment on the CrossLab services and consumables, and then I\\'ll pass it over to Jacob on the PD-L1. When we put together our guidance for the year, we were expecting strong growth in our CrossLab services and consumables business. So that\\'s part of the reasons why we had a lot of confidence coming into this year and still have the confidence in this year about making our organic core revenue growth targets because have you seen even in the Chemical & Energy space, which is down in terms of new instrument purchases, they continue to buy and we see strong growth of services and consumables. So what I\\'ll leave you is we expect continued strength in that space, but we were assuming that to be the case, when we guided the company earlier this year. And, Jacob, why don\\'t you share your thoughts on the PD-L1? Yeah. Thanks, Paul. And you\\'re right that we got the indication approval also for the melanoma for the OPDIVO drug. And that\\'s a great next step in the opportunities for PD-L1. I will not say that it really changes some needle on an Agilent level, but it definitely is a part of our growth story in DGG. But I will remind also that this drug – or this companion diagnostic has only been out now for a few months. And we\\'re still in the early days of seeing the uptake of it. So I see good progress, but not something that really moves the needle here. Mike, last quarter you mentioned that industrial weakness you were seeing spilled over into the Environmental business? I\\'m just wondering whether that\\'s reversed a bit this quarter. So, I guess, is it fair to say that maybe growth in Environmental this year could be a couple of points higher than the cyclical segments? I guess, how would you just compare expectations for Environmental versus industrial for this year? Yeah, Dan. Thanks for the careful observation. And actually, the Environmental business was a pleasant surprise in the first quarter. We knew that China was going to be strong and we\\'ve been talking about China and our view of investments that the Chinese government\\'s making in places such as environmental market and food safety. But I will say that we\\'re happy to see the growth in other segments. Because, yes, the Chemical & Energy space has been under pressure, but what we\\'re still seeing is that fracking is still going on. So the production – while prices of oil are down, the production demand is stable. And, in fact, if you look at the gasoline production in the U.S., for example, it\\'s perhaps going up. So we\\'re seeing a continued need to do Environmental testing. So that\\'s been a nice reaffirmation, if you will, of our outlook for the year, which calling for low-single-digit growth in Environmental. We thought that China would carry the whole load for us, but I think we\\'re getting a little help from the U.S. as well. Okay. And then, maybe just staying in the BRIC region, any change in the way that you\\'re thinking about Brazil and Russia and how that might end up this year? Unfortunately, no. I think we\\'re still looking for very challenged conditions in those countries. I know there\\'s been some recent news today about Russia, and perhaps, working with some of the other oil-producing countries to change some aspects of production. Maybe they\\'ll have some dynamics in terms of their economy, but right now, we\\'re assuming continuation of the current challenged conditions for Brazil and Russia. Yeah. Mike, first question was on gross margin. There\\'s pretty big year-on-year improvement there, and I was wondering if you can maybe break down the key drivers of gross margin performance. The extent to which there might have been one-time benefits and the extent to which there are some items that are going to continue as the year progresses. Yeah. Why don\\'t I make a few high-level comments here, then, Didier, you can jump in and augment my comments. But I think one, there were some one-time improvements. And I think we highlighted those specifically as it related to DGG, where we had some revenue that was really trapped last year in the first quarter due to production issues. But the lion\\'s share of the improvement is resulting from our continued sustained efforts that I highlighted in my call. Both the portfolio efforts in terms of the businesses we\\'re no longer in, the businesses we acquired are changing our gross margin profile. We\\'re taking real cost out of our system through the Agile Agilent program. So there were some one-time events as it relates to the revenue for DGG, but the bulk of our margin improvement is from the underlying core efforts we\\'ve had over the last several quarters to fundamentally change the operating model of the company. Just to point that also contributed the number one – you will recall that last year we were spending heavily on remediation point to address the FDA warning letters. So that is now we\\'re spending significant amounts to maintain our strong position now, but certainly, not in the same magnitude of what we have spent for two years in a row. And then, the second point is there was a favorable mix. We talked about how strong the pharma business is and pharma does generate higher gross margin than the rest of the businesses. So favorable mix and the pharma being just one of them, but a significant one. And then, the FDA, the reduction of FDA spend also in addition to all the points that Mike has made. Okay. That\\'s helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up on CrossLab. You mentioned the driver there, looking like it was just healthy demand in the end-market. But I don\\'t think of that business as necessarily having a sustainable growth rate in that double-digit range. So I\\'m wondering if there was an element of market share that was helpful. It\\'s just not a market where we have a ton of quarter-to-quarter visibility, so I was wondering if you could put some color around the extent to which market share was helpful and how you\\'d characterize where it\\'s coming from. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. I\\'ll make a few comments, and Mark, why don\\'t you jump in with your thoughts here? As we looked at the overall growth rate for CrossLab, you should assume that we\\'re right in the range, where we talked about at the AID, and we think there\\'s both market growth, but as you pointed out, market share gain opportunities for us, where we really have changed our view of what the addressable market is for our business and it\\'s no longer the Agilent install base, but it\\'s the entire lab. Thanks, Mike. And I think you hit on the primary piece, which is we continue to see the primary drivers in pharma, and also, China has been very strong for us. When you pull it all back to when capital spending is constrained, we continue to see customers improve the productivity of their assets through services and the chemistries we talked about earlier. But I think what\\'s more robust than it was a year ago even is really the strength of our multi-vendor and enterprise portfolio. And that does allow you to take share, if you will, from the broader market. So I\\'m just trying to double-check on the guidance map here, because I think a few of us are a little bit confused. So we beat the quarter, right, by around – I don\\'t know – call it, $0.03. We lost $0.033 on FX roughly, and the range came down $0.04. So I\\'m just trying to get a sense for – again, it seems like FX was the key delta, but just the simple math would have suggested to me a little less downward pressure on the full-year range. And again, I realize there\\'s probably a few other moving parts. So I\\'m just trying to make sure I understand how we\\'re doing versus the plan for the year. Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we have reduced our top line revenue from a midpoint from $4.160 billion to $4.110 billion, which is a $50 million reduction. We\\'ve reduced our operating profit from $830 million to $817 million. That\\'s $13 million, and that\\'s entirely due to the impact of the strengthening of the dollar and related to the $50 million. And then, I mentioned $0.033, but with rounding, we are going from the midpoint of $1.88 to the midpoint of $1.84, and that\\'s $0.04, and that\\'s the $0.033, which is rounded because of the – going from one to the other, you can understand that. So basically, what we felt is even though we are starting the year very strongly, we felt that with the overall macroeconomic condition, it would not be wise at this point in time to change the guidance we have provided, core revenue guidance of 4% to 4.5%. We have the same confidence as we had in the month of November, when we provided that guidance that we\\'re in good shape to hit it and perhaps beat it, but certainly, didn\\'t want to change it. Yeah. I guess, what I\\'m trying to get at is sort of the comments last quarter suggested sort of conservatism, right. You obviously can\\'t control what happens with the dollar, so that\\'s understandable. I\\'m just trying to get a sense for how much conservatism there is now in the forecast and whether or not we have risk to that core growth rate, given again that the range came down, but you reiterated the top line. Just making sure that we\\'re sort of not over-extrapolating here. Sure, Ross. This is Mike. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So if you go by the conservatism meter on our guidance, it\\'s at the same level as it was last quarter. So the only real fundamental changes from our outlook is the view on FX. That\\'s it. And that we saw no reason to change our core revenue growth to offset a part of the FX, because FX can go up and down and it\\'s too volatile nowadays to immediately – unless we see some long-term structural changes, as we have last year and we reacted accordingly. We were not going to react by what we believe are temporary changes in FX by actions on our structural spend. Okay. So, sorry. I\\'m going to monopolize for a minute, just because I\\'m trying to make sure my inbox lights up. I\\'m getting everyone the answers they need. So all right. To be clear, we have the FX hit. I\\'d love to also understand what were the key currencies, because most of us can see the dollar\\'s actually, again, we\\'ll see if it sustains, weakened a bit. And so it seems like it\\'s outside the euro and the yen that might have caused some of the headwinds. So I\\'d love to hear just a little bit of color on maybe it\\'s the yuan or some of the other emerging market currencies. And just to be clear also on the second point, so we didn\\'t really bake in the beat from this quarter. Is that where the conservatism comes in? And then, I\\'m done I promise. I\\'ll cede the floor. Yeah. I mean, in terms of the currencies we have a detailed model that takes into account obviously all the currencies. The dollar versus the euro or the dollar versus the yen had a major impact also, I think, dollar versus the British pound. And again, I mean, today\\'s guidance is based on the January 30 exchange rate, so the euro to dollar €0.84 and the yen – and vis-à-vis the yen at the U.S. dollar is ¥121.4 and we are seeing that at today\\'s rate if we had to provide the guidance based on just if we had to – we\\'re able to instantly reflect the currencies as of the day of the guidance, we\\'d have a very different guidance. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So question for Mike on Chemical & Energy. You were down 2% this quarter. The last couple of quarters you were down 9% or 10%. I guess, can you give us a sense for what\\'s happening on the E&P side? You talked about stability on the refining side, but what are you seeing on the E&P side. It seems like that\\'s what allowed the – I guess, the improvement relative to last couple of quarters. Yeah. Actually, it\\'s probably worth maybe just doing a little bridge on the last few quarters, because, in fact, we\\'ve seen relative flat performance over the last several quarters. And while instruments were down the percentage you were talking about, high-single-digits, we\\'ve seen a continuing ability to offset through services and consumables. So what I would say is that the Chemical & Energy market is sort of playing out the way we had expected for the year. So we wish we had a different story here, but the oil price is low as you know, but the product demand still remains pretty strong for our customers\\' products. So the refineries are running, the chemical plants are running, and then we\\'re really trying to sell to them new equipment based on a productivity message, but at the same point in time, recognize that if they use the equipment longer, it\\'s a good opportunity for us on the services and consumable side. One thing I would ask you to reflect on is that Q1 2015, as you dig into some of the numbers, Q1 2015 really was our best quarter for the whole year. I think we grew 3% in the first quarter of last year on a core basis. We ended up growing, I think, 1% for the whole year so that shows you were declining through the year. And so I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the numbers. We think it\\'s right in the range where we thought. Well, no, not really. I think, as you said, it\\'s playing out as we expected. There\\'s continued pressure on the exploration side and production side. But for the refinery side, demand really drives. Also, replacement business for us, we try to incentivize our customers and give them opportunity to upgrade to increase their productivity and efficiency. And on the chemical side, I would say that the lower feedstock prices have not yet fully materialized. So we stay with focus for the year to – for the whole segment to stay flat. Okay. And, Jeff, this is Mike. I think we shared these numbers with you in the past. But the way we looked at this – we always look at our business, say, about 15% or so is in E&P, as you described, exploration and production, which will be about 3% to 4% of our total revenues. About 35% of that segment is in refining and the other 50% is in chemicals. So that\\'s how we – it remains stable at a subdued level. I\\'d like to follow up just a bit on the pharmaceutical space. It was really helpful to hear just how confident you guys are in the outlook for the year growing 8% in pharma. I wondered if you can maybe add a little bit to the conversation, though, and talk about what you\\'re hearing, Mike or Patrick, in your conversations with pharma customers as they talk about their budgets for this year? I apologize for coming back to the topic, but there\\'s a lot of interest out there in the sustainability of growth in the space. So any color you could offer on how your customers are thinking would be really helpful. Sure. Thanks. So what we\\'re hearing from our customers is that actually they are holding their budgets. We don\\'t see any significant reduction there. And this comes, by the way, across the board from small and medium-sized and large enterprises. So it\\'s really for us, it\\'s a good mixture between different sized companies and also between the different markets. Talking about small molecule versus biopharmaceuticals, the growth really comes from both sides. And this is why we\\'re so confident that we will maintain to see this high-single-digit growth for pharma. And the other thing that we\\'ve done, so we\\'re getting broad-based demand across all segments of the market. Then we also continue to do our own math in terms of what\\'s out there, in terms of the install base of our products. So we have a pretty good idea of – at least on the technology refresh side how much more demand we can expect in the segment. That\\'s extremely helpful. One corollary, one follow-up there. I wonder if you could give us a sense for, to what extent, the success that you\\'re having in pharma and the success that you\\'re having in CrossLab are interrelated. Are those two perhaps a little bit more overlapping than CrossLab as with some of the other customer verticals? And to what extent, is one dependent on the other? Thanks so much. Great question. Happy to elaborate. They are highly connected. So when we talk about pharma market demand, it\\'s both driving new equipment purchases, which were the focus on Patrick\\'s comments, but also, there\\'s a demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. But on the CrossLab side, not only are they investing in ongoing chemistries and services to maintain their operations and support their application needs, what we\\'re also seeing is a change in the model. So what they\\'re doing is they are taking activities that historically have been done inside the company and are creating, if you will, a new set of services for vendors in our space to handle things such as asset management. And that\\'s creating a new set of services that are being created right now in pharma. We haven\\'t seen that new set of services demand develop yet on the Chemical & Energy side, but we\\'re hopeful that it will down the road. But there\\'s a couple of dynamics going on in the pharma space, which are driving both the new instrument purchases and the consumables and services from CrossLab. Thank you. Wondered if you could give us a update on market for tuck-in acquisitions. What you\\'re thinking about these days in terms of where you might like to plug some holes. And also, are you seeing more opportunities now that some valuations have come in? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate the opportunity to provide a perspective on here. So although we remain focused on our organic growth opportunities, we\\'ve got a lot of very exciting plans and new products coming out, and working on the go-to-market capabilities I mentioned in my call comments. We\\'re really continuing to look for acquisitions that augment our current portfolio and add to our company capabilities. And so I think you saw doing the Seahorse deal, where we added capabilities in life science, research, Cartagenia in the area of next-gen sequencing. We built out our workflow there. We\\'d still like to find ways to build out our workflow in next-gen sequencing. And so our stated strategies of really adding capabilities, expanding our portfolio, building on our workflow solutions with particular emphasis on life sciences, research, next-gen sequencing workflows in the overall consumables and services place, they\\'re our priorities. Well, that being said, most people still have the memories of the 52-week highs. So we\\'ll see how this plays out. And what I will tell you is we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about M&A and does it provide an attractive return to our shareholders, and can we do something to make the business better? If we can\\'t make the business better, it\\'s not something we\\'d be interested in. Mike, you pointed to strength in China in the period. Just curious, if you could elaborate on the actual growth rate in the first quarter and if there\\'s been any deviation from the mid- to high-single-digit target for the year? Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about China; one of my favorite topics. So we saw a very good demand in China, high-single-digit growth in our analytical lab business. And as I mentioned to you in the past, the markets here are really being driven by strong investments in government policy-driven initiatives around quality of life concerns, whether the environment, drug and food safety. So all the markets with the exception of Chemical & Energy really saw quite strong growth. And we\\'re underpenetrated in DGG business compared to the rest of the company. We\\'ve talked about that in the past. And we\\'re underpenetrated in a growing market for cancer diagnostics, for example. And I recently saw some statistics that I thought were really quite amazing. There was a report by the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said that every minute an average of six people in the country were diagnosed with cancer, and five of those six would eventually die of the disease. So unfortunately, there\\'s going to be growing demand for cancer diagnostics as well. I\\'m going to wrap this all up by saying we remain quite comfortable with the mid- to high-single-digit growth expectation we laid out for China. It was strong for us in the first quarter and we expect that to continue through the year. Then one more for Didier. Could you split out the contribution from Seahorse relative to the headwind from the NMR in the first quarter in terms of just dollars? No, no, no, we don\\'t provide guidance or information regarding the acquisitions. We have stated and we are exactly in line that we expect Seahorse revenue to grow double-digits in 2016 versus 2015. And we expect the Seahorse operating margin to be also in the double-digits. So no change to our expectations. Well, the integration of Seahorse is going very well. It\\'s giving us extended reach also into the research market, and this was the whole play. Plus, we, of course, used the opportunity to use our strength in pharma to sell these products into the pharma space in areas like disease discovery as well. And this will drive the growth in fiscal year 2016. As Didier said, we expect double-digit growth. We have the salesforce trained and we are looking forward to a very strong Q2, Q3, Q4 for this product line. Hey. How are you? Maybe just first on capital deployment, you did $200 million in buybacks in the quarter. You guided for $480 million for the year. I mean, it sounds like you all front-end loaded, and I mean, how do we think about a reauthorization once you get through this tranche, given your stock\\'s probably under some pressure tomorrow? Yeah. We basically decided to buy back in Q1 what we had not been able to do in Q4 of the preceding year. And then, we have filed a 10b5-1 with certain formula. But for your model, you should assume that we are buying about one-third of the remaining $280 million per quarter. And then, just to clarify on the margins, because I\\'ve had a few questions. I mean, the $13 million hit is the FX hit, but, I guess, people are having a hard time understanding why you\\'re not seeing faster-than-expected realization of the COGS and SG&A cuts that we saw some of that this quarter. Why doesn\\'t that carry through for the next three quarters? We\\'re not saying it\\'s not going to carry us through. We\\'re saying we saw no reason in the present environment to change the guidance on an operating margin basis, 20.2% that we had provided, 20% to 20.5% that we had provided previously, and again, with the same level of conservatism as we had in November. So that\\'s basically the – that was the premise for us maintaining both the core revenue growth and the operating margin we had provided in November. And, Didier, I\\'d just add, in my call comments, I tried to highlight a few things on a longer-term nature to show you that we\\'re not out of gas in this tank in terms of our ability to continue to move our operating margin. We have other larger-hitting programs that are coming in late 2016 and will carry on into 2017 as well. So this is not a one-time quarter where we just got a favorable mix, whatever. There\\'s real fundamental improvements underway in the operating margin capabilities of the company. And then, I guess, speaking of running out of gas, you talked about refiners holding up. There\\'s been news that at least two of the country\\'s largest refiners are cutting output of gasoline. What gives you conviction that your business there holds up? I\\'m not sure exactly what you\\'re referring to, but relative to our view is that gasoline will continue to be needed to run the economy, and there\\'s going to be demand there. And what we\\'ve tried to share, as long as production is running and there\\'s demand, the refineries will meet that demand. So we\\'ve seen no significant changes in the underlying demand for gas. And, in fact, Patrick, I think you were showing me some statistics the other day about what\\'s going on in the area of refineries in the U.S. Yeah. I mean, what we see, as Mike said, is the continued demand for – not only in the U.S., but also in the emerging economies like China. So the refineries are basically running at capacity right now. There will be no new builds, but we see that they\\'ve replaced existing equipment, and they also go into service contracts with us. They look for opportunities to drive more efficiencies, which gives us an opportunity to upgrade the install base with automation features and other things to make sure that the customers can save money with the equipment as well. So the oil price is clearly driven by the fact that there\\'s overcapacity on the production side. But the refinery volume has not gone down significantly over the last quarters. Okay. And then, just lastly, can you talk about linearity in the quarter? Anything notable in January? You guys have an extra month versus a lot of your comps, so just wondering if there\\'s anything worth calling out in January trends versus November and December? Yeah. No, I\\'d just point to two things. One is in terms of our normal seasonality through the quarter. Q1 of 2016 was like prior quarters. We always see a nice strong December as we close off year-end with our customers. And followed our typical seasonality patterns through November, December and January. I think probably the only thing of note would be in the DDG side. We had, I think, one less working day, I think, this year. So that does affect the Genomics business in terms of how much revenue we get in that quarter. But really, it was business as usual, if you will, through the first quarter. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on Tycho\\'s last question, just around the academic end-market. I\\'m curious, you mentioned in the presentation around some of the modestly larger research budgets being released in the U.S. Curious on your view on the NIH and really timing-related there, because of the timing of the Congressional approvals at year-end. Yeah. I can take this question here. We have seen moderate growth again in Academia & Government, which was a positive surprise. And as you all have read, there are more budgets available now in the U.S. These budgets are slowly released and drove some of the growth for us in Q1. And looking at the funnel moving forward, we actually see a good funnel there as well. So we stay with the forecast of low-single-digit growth for Academia & Government, at the moment, mainly driven by the U.S., which is where we see the strongest demand. Got it. And are your expectations for this level of growth to stay at the same rate through the end of the fiscal year? Are you assuming the budgets get released a little bit faster from here? If the budgets were to be released faster, I think, it would probably be upside for us. Our current view is low-single-digits for Academia & Government for the year. Got it. And then, just one other question on the margins in DGG, definitely appreciate the year-over-year improvement. I was wondering what your thoughts were bridging through the end of the year just given how the relative margins compared to the end of 2015. Thanks. Great. I know Jacob\\'s given a lot of thought to that potential question. So I\\'ll pass it over to you, Jacob, to provide some color there. Yeah. Thanks for that, Jack, and first of all, I want to say that very pleased to see the improvement versus the Q1 last year, but you\\'re also right that versus Q4 that we saw a bit of a decrease and that was actually where most expected. We sit in the DGG business with a pretty fixed cost base. So when you have a Q1 with the lower base than in Q4, you will see that our margins has also impacted economy. So you always see us coming out with a strong Q4 and a weaker Q1 and the gross margin also on our operating margin. So it\\'s kind of by the book and really as expected. Yeah. I would just add that there\\'s no change in plan and Jacob is still absolutely committed to reaching 20% operating margin in 2017. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your question please. So I\\'m just curious. You\\'re guiding to a 22% operating margin for 2017, so that\\'s implying – assuming the 20.2% midpoint, 130 basis points to 180 basis points of margin expansion next year. I\\'m just curious, if you couldn\\'t find 10 additional basis points of margin expansion in 2016 to offset the impact, what gives you confidence you\\'re going to be able to get 130 basis points, 180 basis points next year? I\\'d just reiterate – great question this one. Again by the way, one of the things as you heard me say earlier in my comments, we continue to make sure we\\'re realistic and we think about our business not on some hope and a prayer, but we actually have solid plans behind our long-term operating goals. And I think we have a lot of confidence for two reasons. One is we have a plan that can get us there with not all the top line, it\\'s probably in the range of 4% ago, we can get to the margin goals. We\\'ve laid out a plan that\\'s got 60% of this coming from the cost side. And we have multi-year programs that are going to take significant cost out of our structure. So I highlighted a field in my call, I mean, changes in terms of our benefit structure, changes in terms of our IT cost, our IT systems. It is a major company-wide initiatives that right now we\\'re underway. You won\\'t start to see them going through the P&L until like late 2016 going into 2017. So these are the kind of things that give us confidence to say, okay, there\\'s a path that gets us to where we want to get to in 2017. Okay. Great. It was the late 2016, early 2017 that, I think, that was the key that I was looking for in that. Second question. Second question is given some of the turmoil going on in Europe, have you seen any changes in the academic or government spending like the governments grapple with the refugee crisis and everything that\\'s going on? Is there any noticeable change to spending patterns in Europe? Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So on the gross margin line, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of the product mix? As I look at the different groups really the margin leverage seem to come through the Life Sci and Applied Markets Group. You guys almost reported a 59% gross margin there. Comment on the mix, please, and why margin for that Group specifically is expected to moderate when, I guess, historically it\\'s been pretty steady quarter-to-quarter throughout the year? I think there are two things I would point to and then, Didier, feel free to jump in in as well. But first of all, remember, the change we\\'re making to our portfolio. So we\\'ve exited the NMR hardware business and we\\'re starting to see some of those margin improvements shown on the P&L where we had revenue in the NMR business and much higher revenues in FY 2015. And then, our pharma business is pulling a lot of Liquid Chromatography, which is one of our highest gross margin products. I think it\\'s really perhaps those are the things... You said it all. Absolutely. I had mentioned earlier that the favorable mix came in part from the pharma mix. And within pharma, clearly Liquid Chromatography has the higher-than-average operating margin and gross margin. So to clarify, you felt that there was either a catch-up ordering or stocking in the quarter on those products specifically that\\'s not expected to continue for the rest of the year? Well, you can almost think about pharma – we had 19% pharmaceutical growth in the first quarter. What we\\'re saying is we can\\'t expect 19% to happen each of the next three quarters, what we do expect is continued strong demand, and right now, we\\'re calling 8% for the entire year. So that\\'s what you\\'re seeing in terms of reflected in our mix column as it relates to gross margin. Okay. And then, on the FX rate, so if you just use the DXY proxy, right, the last quarter was actually pretty elevated, but since then, the trend has actually come back into closer to where you guided the year. Are you expecting – is there some nuance within this on how certain currencies have moved? Or are you just assuming worst-case that the dollar goes back up here? It\\'s just pure math. So we\\'re not making any projections at all about future levels of FX. What Didier has done is, he takes the currency spot rates on the last day of the reported quarter, and that\\'s how we guide the company. We say okay, that\\'s what we know and we\\'ll assume that rate stays the same the rest of the year, and then, it\\'s just pure math from there. And that\\'s why I made a comment on my script that would we had used, for example, today\\'s exchange rates, the guidance would have been higher, because the dollar between January 31 and today has weakened. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. We\\'d like to wish you a good day, and I\\'m sure we\\'ll be talking later. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2016 Agilent Technologies, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

Before turning things over to Mike, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York City on May 25. Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent Investor Relations website. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\\'s call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter for the Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight three key results. First, revenue growth was up over 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4% an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year. Before moving on to a view of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons which reflect the unusual event from last year of 8% core growth that we\\'re announcing today about 1.5 percentage points is due to our shift of our revenue last year from Q2 \\'15 into Q3 \\'15. In the second quarter year ago, we experienced $50million of shipment delays due to startup challenges with our new U.S. logistic center. In addition, our process improvement efforts over the past two quarters to convert our incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid-off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times particularly in China. Consequently some shipments initially forecasted for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. Agilent\\'s strong Q2 results were led by double digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in Academia & Government, Environmental and Diagnostic and Clinical Markets. All end markets grew except Chemical & Energy. Growth was broad based across our most of our portfolios. Geographically all regions grew except Japan led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8% led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About three percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year\\'s U.S. logistic centre startup. A combination of strong topline growth, expense management and growth margin improvements partially due to the NMR exit drove LSAG\\'s operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strength this portfolio in Q2 as it introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent’s leadership decision in metabolomics. Last week we announced a new Agilent 1260, infinity-II LC at the analytical trade show. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves the formats of full backward compatibility. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continued to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10% led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be the strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus year ago at 21.5%.CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I’m pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with 2016 Reviewers Choice award for customer service. This award is from Select Science, an independent expert led scientific review. This is the second year in a row, that scientists in North America have judged Agilent\\'s customer service to be the best in the Laboratory products industry. Finally the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on its steady trajectory back to market growth rates., highlighted by the strong demand for our new PD-L1companion and complimentary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance led by our SureSelect Target Enrichment and our Array CGH offerings. DGG\\'s operating margin was flat versus year ago at 15%. In Q2 Agilent announced an $80million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. In Q2, Agilent also announced the commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1diagnostic test for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO. Now, I’ll provide an overview of Agilent\\'s core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14% fueled by technology research deals, new product uptick, and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid to high double digit growth in pharma. Academia & Government grew 7% driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics led by target enrichment in Array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Flu was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now, I’d turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This will resolve our ability to outgrow the market while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company, making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of companywide streamline of organizations, processes, and systems continues to be on track to deliver incremental saving in 2017. For example, in Q3, we will take a major step forward in simplifying the company\\'s system infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested 80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our one Agilent initiative driving was well-received cultural transformation to improve cost company collaboration and delivering of results. At last year\\'s Analyst and Investor Day described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I\\'d like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer term goals. After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth in 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we’ve now had two strong quarters to start 2016 including this quarter\\'s 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent leadership team has put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We’ve completed the offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the Company\\'s split. In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 onto now, we’ve also invested our 400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later while we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS, and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half \\'16 forecast in light of what we’ve already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. We look at today\\'s overall market environment while we face increasingly tough competitors, we expect strength and pharma are continuing the second half of 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in second half of 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we’ve been experiencing a more prolong and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time with a recent well reported spill over into the refining segment. There are initial indications however of a bottoming with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. We have projected an improved chemical and energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are two reasons for this increase. First, we expect to have a very strong new product introduction in the second half of FY \\'16 which will drive revenue growth in FY 17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year end, accompanied by continuing solid conditions and all of our other end markets and in China. Overall, we remain on track with your 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins to 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the one Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day where I will share our progress versus our commitments. How we will sustain our improved performance and the longer term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Didier? Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again. 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year’s $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launched our new U.S. logistic center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market. During the quarter, we bought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At mid-point, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis, or close to 3% adjusting for last year’s $15 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now, to the guidance of fiscal year 2016. We are raising the mid-point of our revenue guidance by $60 million including $50 million due to currencies. As a result, we are increasing our core revenue growth guidance at mid-point from 4.25% to 4.50%. We are also raising the mid-point of our EPS guidance by $0.06 including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method account. This means that we will not book our share Lasergen losses as previously communicated. Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million and there is no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million.  And our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Thank you. Two questions. First off, can you elaborate on the business trends you\\'re seeing in Europe? And then secondly on the pharma end market, can you talk about what gives you confidence in the fiscal \\'17 outlook that you have yet another strong year in pharma, following two years then of tough comps in capital markets, which have been more or less shut? Thank you. Thanks Dan. I think I’m actually going to pass that over to Patrick who is just back from a trip to Europe and maybe he can provide some insight on what’s going on in Europe and then also if he can pick up the question on pharma as well. Sure. I’m happy to do so. Let me start first giving you some insights on Europe. We have seen actually some decent growth in Central Europe, we have seen some weaknesses on what we call the idea was states Eastern Europe and that\\'s mainly driven by the Chemical & Energy market or the Energy market of that site. In Central Europe there is deadly strengths in Germany and other states around that. We still see some issues on academia and government side is rather flat, but pharma for example is also very strong in Europe. For your pharma question, overall we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma. For the remainder of this year we target low double digit growth for pharma and looking into 2017 we think the pharma market will be continue to be strong for us driven by two vectors. We see a continue demand in the replacement business and as you probably know we just launched at the Analytica conference we launched our new 1216-20L series as an example together with the InfinityLab consumables and service and we think that will drive – continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma. And then we see also continue demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with these more complex molecules in terms of analysis and we have a very comprehensive offering for a space as well. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. Congratulations on another great quarter, Mike. Can you maybe elaborate a little on - I think you said core guidance, and if I\\'m looking at your presentation, core revenue growth guidance in the third quarter is pretty precise at 1.3%. I think I just heard that you still expect pharma to grow low double digits. Could you give a little insight as to what you\\'re seeing in the third quarter? Yes, what we looked at was what\\'s our growth rate that we\\'ve had over the first half of this year and as we look into Q3 and Q4. And what I\\'d point to is a couple of things, Jonathan first of all tough compares and this is inclusive of a few one-time moves between quarters which actually were driven by improvements overall operation, so as Didier mentioned we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3 - which when we had our start up issues of the new logistics center. So we adjust for that to catch-up about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we’ve been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually install and we can recognize a revenue. In Q2 we actually see their expectations and we got there a lot faster we had thought. And what that meant was, we had a significant amount of revenue probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially had forecasted into the third quarter. On all of you kind of take into account those things you\\'ve got put in more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. I would tell you though the chemical and energy is still looking for a bottom and that\\'s why we have that outlook for the year which basically this down it will stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have not convinced yet we\\'ve seen the bottom chemical and energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook on chemical and energy is what\\'s driving the overall guidance for the second half. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, I guess just one more. Are there any - sometimes when we see shifts onto one platform, like Oracle to SAP, is there anything at all, any wiggle room you\\'ve left there, in terms of hiccups in the quarter, or maybe just --? What we thought to do you\\'re exactly right Jonathan. So the wiggle room we left was we made sure we went live first month of the quarter. And Didier is in the conference room here smiling and Didier if you want to add any additional color on how it\\'s going so far. Yes, it\\'s going very well the migrations and the start up of the operation there was zero disruption. Obviously we expect to have to deal with some stabilization activities throughout the quarter we\\'ll do too close before we do the quarterly close. So everything we couldn’t be happier about how it went and you\\'re correct, it is a very complex and one that we\\'re pretty used to, we’ve done a few of those in the past, but still it remains a very complex interview and we are really happy how smoothly it went. And Jonathan as I pointed out in my script, this is one of the Agile Agilent initiatives which you\\'ll start to see pay offs in our cost structure as we move into 2017. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Just following up on that last point on the SAP margins, can you maybe - on the margin impact. Can you maybe quantify how much that could play on margins for this year? For 2016 I think it would be very limited at best Tycho, because we’ll be running some duplicate backup systems and then the other aspects of our external spends, later on come out to 2017. So I really position that in - as you think about this more of the 2017 impact, but prove point why we think we\\'re going to be able to improve our margins again in 2017. And then academic, 7%, can you maybe just talk as to whether you\\'re seeing an acceleration there? What you saw this quarter? Yes, what we saw in the last quarter is really strong performance in China and some increased signs of life in the U.S. side of things, I think and that\\'s will be pointing to an uptick. None a lot of significant moves on the European side is mainly a China story, and I think there\\'ll be upside to it to become from the U.S. how we\\'re thinking about it. Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of pharma, obviously that\\'s been a nice driver. Can you maybe talk about where you think we are in the LCMS upgrade cycle, and how much your growth going forward is going to be contingent on R&D budget expanding versus the upgrade cycle? Yes sure Tycho great question, I know Patrick now look at this pretty closely and what’s the update of you on that. Yes, so I think the two cycles we’re looking at, the first sight we went through was the upgrade cycle from sell HPLC to UHPLC which is still ongoing but a considerable part of that probably has been done. But when you look at the installed base of instrumentation it still deals with core LC and this is where we are targeting with the Infinity II Series right now. There\\'s still a lot of foot placement pending out there. Just as reminder, we had probably about 150,000 systems out there based on the 1100, 1200 platform which overtime will be up for replacement and we have positioned extremely well in the pharma platforms because it\\'s 100% bankruptcy compatible and we’re also able to for example to emulate some of our competitor systems on our platforms of a technology we called ISET intelligence system emulation technology. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi thanks. Good afternoon guys. I just wanted to start, the better - at least relative to what I was looking for, looked like you had better gross margins in the LSAG segment, now two quarters in a row. Can you just talk about what some of the notable changes there are? Is there anything with product mix that\\'s driven the improvement, or do you think this is the new norm to look for? Let me make some initial comments and then Didier or Patrick you can add – build to it. So in terms of product mix, part of what you\\'re seeing is the fact that we are winding down through our P&L the impact of the NMR business, and I think you can see the benefit of that exit decision on the P&L because it really has been contributing to the - improved the gross margins. That\\'s not the whole story. The other story is obviously the strong demand for the products and the volume benefits we\\'re getting, as well as the focus on taking cost out of our material cost side of our business as well as we talk a lot about the logistics last year, we can also talk about logistics this year, which is we\\'re doing a much better job in terms of overall logistics operations that\\'s blowing through on the P&L as well. Great. And then just one more for the adoption of the companion diagnostics, now a few quarters into the launch. Are you in a position, could you maybe help us size what that business is today, or just in the market, what you think you hold in terms of market share? Thanks. Yes, thanks for that question and we are definitely pleased with the pick off the PD-L1 and this continues during the last basically now three quarters. The market is still very early. We still really only in U.S. we’ve had a press releases here lately also that we are entering into Europe but we are just scratching the surface in Europe. And furthermore it’s still addressing the second line treatment and if that also goes to the first line treatment the market will become significantly larger. At this point of time it’s still small revenue in the biggest scheme of things but I do believe that the PD-L1 has an opportunity to be as big as the other two markets. However, I will also remind you that of at least four probably five different potential blocks and companion diagnostic outset has to share that market. So, still early days but a great opportunity. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Mike or Didier, could you give us the China growth rate, the percentage change in the quarter, and if you could speak to demand in the food area outside of China and Asia, that would be helpful? Yes. In the China our resolve for Q2 what we\\'ve been pointing to is a strong double digit growth. It was a very, very strong quarter for us in China, I would remind you that part of the strong growth was not only the strength of the market but also the operational efficiency improvement I talked about, where we really shortened the improved cycle time from orders to install that was really dramatic in China. So, the overall business is quite strong here, you should not expect a strong double digit growth every quarter though for Q3, Q4 quarter. But, overall China is - Mr. McMullen completed the story here. When we came into this year, we thought that the overall performance for Agilent in China might be high single digits but now look a low double digit growth in China for the full year. Thanks. One more for Didier. I notice you bumped the operating cash flow guidance of about $90 million. How much of an impact does the - I noticed the tax refund benefit. If you could quantify that, and just help us bridge the delta between prior versus new? The over-all tax outlays forecast for this year, were I think about $10 million less than what we had anticipated in our initial guidance, $10million or $15million. And the rest is really operational performance, improvements, working capital, management, FX and then just our operating profits. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, guys. Mike, since taking over it\\'s obviously been a pretty hectic journey, and your messaging from the beginning has been pretty consistent around growth in margins and returns. Obviously, the last few quarters you started develop a cadence, last quarter results were good, but we had the challenges on FX. Do you feel like this is the first quarter where you feel like you got to deliver the full bag, where you were able to drop through the top line outperformance, which is clearly better than market, you drove the margins, you\\'re buying stock, the returns are up, the cash flow\\'s good, that you were finally able to show the market that the business model\\'s working, and that feeds, I guess, into your confidence also, I would assume, on 2017? Yes. I couldn’t said have better of myself. Thanks Ross for the question, I think that we’ve been working really hard over last four, five quarters with our new leadership team and as you look at everything came together this quarter, we had strong growth, and we had improvement in our operating margin that pointed out of 2015. But all of the factors really came together nicely in the second quarter, and I was particularly pleased on the more operational activities that we are working on inside the company. And that may not always be so apparent initially on the outside world, but you\\'re started to see the results. The fact we are doing, it’s just a logistic challenge, here I have to talk about near year compares but expects – actually is now contributing to improved results. Yes, we had a talk about the shortened cycle time for orders to revenue and burdensome revenues of what we’ve initially planned for the third quarter but we made this operational improvement the cycle times are shorter and this is now the new normal. So, I guess that was the closing comments, yes with a new normal for the company we have a lot of confidence about 2017. Perhaps, it’s been a little bit of thunder for the Analyst meeting next week but still hope everyone attends, but when you start have these prove points of quarter in and quarter out. I think it starts to show you the team is delivering and I think the results are now starting to be appreciated and believed. Great. And maybe quickly just on Seahorse, can you just give us an update on how that business is performing relative to your expectations, and how it\\'s plugged in, and where you\\'re seeing maybe the early fruits and some cross-synergy with the existing business? Yes, we just in fact very timely question Ross, we just had our 180 day review this morning and Patrick you want to go ahead and share a couple highlights from that session. Sure absolutely, what I really would like to highlight is how seamlessly the integration of Seahorse went, so we are now at now six months in the integration and we will say the targeting full integration by June which means that you have implemented all of the systems which is a pretty fast pace. At the same time we are seeing the positioning of Seahorse regional portfolio really works out, we see nice deals and combined sales of LCMS and Seahorse and areas like disease research and disease discovery that is actually exactly where we thought it\\'s complementing a lot of strength in metabolomics with the life style metabolism which Seahorse brings today. And this is a very nice story that wasn\\'t really expected well before our customers. Again we on a integration side, we are very pleased with where we stand and we are looking forward to a very successful second half. Yes, Ross I’d add two things. The comment I made to the team this morning this is the fastest I\\'ve seen is doing integration. These things usually plod along for many quarters in some cases for years this one is moving along really, really fast. And we\\'re getting some wins the fact we want an LCMS deal because Seahorse , so it’s the complementary nature the portfolio is starting to work.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Mike, the move you made to creates CrossLab seems to be gaining traction. Can you give us a little background on CrossLab, in terms of who do you think is taking -- it\\'s taking share from somebody at that growth rate. Could you give us more color on CrossLab? Yes, so as you mentioned that was a major strategic move where when we some the company we established as CrossLab group. We had this division about how we could really attack and go after the enterprise wide services and consumers\\' opportunity. And as you see marketing team have really been delivering and we know that customers are responding to the value proposition that Agilent offers both in terms of our service capability is due and that\\'s why I mentioned in my script about the external recognition we recently received.  But they also appreciate the fact we’re able to give them insights in terms of actually helping them improve the business operation and we\\'re seeing a real strong demand for this in the pharma and growing interest in other parts that flag markets. So we know that we\\'re growing faster than some of our competitors in this space. We also know that there\\'s only a few companies really trying to go after this type of business, I believe this is where the market is already going to, and I think you want to be a player here. And I\\'ll leave it to you guys to figure out who\\'s the losing share. But I think, I can tell you as we\\'re growing close to double digit in the space, so that been attractive move for us.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.  Thanks, congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to make sure I understand the variance in the quarter relative to what you were expecting. I believe you had called last quarter for 4% core growth, and we saw 8% this quarter. I hear you, that it sounds like about half of that variance, about 200 basis points, was from the better book backlog to revenue conversion this quarter. And I know you also called out the compare relative to last year. But that compare should have already been known. So I just want to understand what\\'s the other 200 basis points, that really surprised you in the quarter? Sure Tim, again thanks for your comment and I can give you a few dollar numbers of the revenue impact the way we look at it in. And you can do them perhaps the math on the impact on the on the growth rates, but what we saw a relative to our initial expectations for the quarter were really – well first let\\'s start with the market right, so the overall market demand came in as we predicted, we saw good growth across entire portfolio led by pharma improve markets in China as you heard earlier. But I\\'d ask you to look at two things, one is this higher conversion of water to revenue than forecast so base what we’ve done as we reduce the cycle time and by our estimates it happens lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2 the other thing I think you should take a look at is the FX assumptions so around $9 million or so Didier think that’s the number. FX added about another $9 million so between the cycle time improvements the FX assumptions and is the fact of the market continues to get we\\'re getting our fair share of markets where they\\'re growing I think those companies those three facts I think will help you bridge the difference between our guided growth and what actually occurred. Okay. Just a real quick similar question on the margin side. Obviously a little bit of the margin in the quarter was the drop-through, but it looks like you probably did better than you were expecting on an absolute dollar basis on the SG&A, as well. Can you help me understand maybe what is going a little faster there than you anticipated? Yes, I think on the SG&A front I mean we got a couple of our programs inside in the agile are little bit ahead of plan. But Didier if there\\'s anything else -  I will tell you the field structure that we put in place last year. You know it\\'s really stable down I think it\\'s delivering helping us on the growth side and also on the SG&A front as more efficient g to market channel. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, thank you. I had a question on margins, as well. On the gross margin side, I was curious if we should expect maybe another wave of improvement, now that you have the ERP integration done. And on the op margin side, curious how satisfied you are with the sales force realignment, and whether or not there\\'s still more synergies to be had there as well? Yes, a couple of comments here then I’ll hand  that over to Didier in a case like to add a few things here. But in terms of the sales force integration and go to market we couldn\\'t be happier I mean that was a major move made last year where we basically went from five sales force into sales forces one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. As the time I remember sharing with you, hey we\\'re making a big change here and it could affect the top line in the short one that didn\\'t happen. And in fact I submit that as we go out into 2016 and 2017 we\\'re now putting more resources of specialization academia in biopharma, so I think you can see the changes paying off in terms of long term growth. So we\\'re really happy with both the fact that we\\'ve got it all behind us and settle down and think it started to pay off on the initial benefits of in vision when we created that structure.  Relative to gross margin ERP I just keep in mind that what we\\'ve been talking about is a financial systems which really go into the SG&A line so it really won\\'t affect the gross margin. That being said we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in 2016 and 2017. I\\'ll talk a little bit more about in detail next week in New York but as you may know our initial 400 basis points improvement when I came on board we said half a come through OpEx and other operational costs and then others through grow in the growth piece of the a lot of the driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increase volume. So we think we still have room to improve our material cost. And we think that we\\'ve got room to continue to bring down our logistics cost. That\\'s very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up, just to clarify on two topics, one on biopharma, and the other one on the comments you made around China. On biopharma, could you just compare the growth rates you\\'re seeing in the QA/QC setting versus R&D, and then in China, just curious, how much of your improved outlook there is based on the visibility you have with government funding versus end markets that are more on the private industry side? Thank you. I think that on the question – we\\'re not seeing a real significant differences in growth rates across the segment you described in pharma, I do think if you go out a couple years down the road I think we\\'d expect the growth rate in the biopharma be higher than a small molecule with us not that long at all the case right now and you’ve heard earlier from Patrick we expect that to continue through 2017. We\\'re getting more clarity about what\\'s going on in China, I think there was a lot of concerns at one point time on the private sector side of the business, but obviously as you know I think the government drives the market there to a large extent and we\\'re getting more clarity on what\\'s happening in funding so that\\'s why we have increased confidence in our outlook for our business in China.  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Hi good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify. Did I hear you correctly, that you said your initial flash for core growth guidance for FY17 was 4.5% at the midpoint? Okay. And so can you like flank that in terms of what you\\'re thinking for the chemical and energy market there? I mean, just what you\\'re expecting in terms of rebound? Could you help us frame that comment a little bit more, in terms of some of the puts and takes. Sure I\\'d be happy to because sometimes you use colorful language it doesn\\'t really give you the insight you need, so let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year we thought our performance would be flat for the entire year. Well in fact it\\'s going to be down, we probably think in the range 2.5%, 3% for the entire year. And that is the change from our assumptions come in this year and that was the assumption be made at the time our initial guidance which makes our revenue results even much more we\\'re really pleased with the results given the fact that the chemical energy market is not develop the way we initially had and thought.  That being said in 2017 we actually will be improved which means it won\\'t be redo it won\\'t be declining and in fact will probably be flat or maybe low single digits and why do we believe that, if you look at how our business breaks down in that segment we often talk about the oil side, but 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration of another 35% has been in the refining the other half which is by far the biggest, I mean biggest individual segment is the chemical side and they\\'re benefiting by lower feedstock costs they\\'ve got pent up investment demands and we\\'re starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact Patrick and I were talking about this morning the kind reminds me of a pharma a few years ago, basically it’s going to have years of shrinking performance in this marketplace. A lot of pent up demand so long story short our growth assumption would actually assumes the low single digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again we still believe we\\'re a surge from the bottom, so it\\'s in still early in the year of 2016 but that\\'s our basic assumption for 207 which is an improved environment, not dramatic, but improved from what we\\'ve seen over the last 24 months.  Just as a quick follow-up on the chemicals comment. You\\'re not worried that some of the activity between Dow and DuPont, and looks like there may be Monsanto and some of these other companies that are dancing around, are you worried that could stymie investment, if you\\'re using the pharma analogy of combinations of those companies, is there some potential headwinds from the chemicals market? Yes, that’s a great question and we looked at this pretty closely when announcement was first made and although Dow and DuPont are very important customers to us that particular deal activity really is immaterial to the total Company’s performance. And then we don\\'t necessary it is the sign of an acceleration M&A and a consolidation is going on in the space. So of course there would be some pause if we would see more of that, but we\\'re not overly concerned about that and I guess the beauty of this business has been just the broad based nature of our customer base or not overly dependent on the one single customer. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, thanks. Mike, can you touch on Japan and things that you saw during the quarter in terms of trends, and maybe what you\\'re looking for at this point on the year? Yes. So Dan, there\\'s a question in and if you know a little bit my history it\\'s been to five years in Japan, so I always been a big support of Japan in terms of a long term view of the market. And I\\'d ask to take a long term view of the market in Japan, so that was the only market that actually went down for us in the second quarter and we are expecting continued some do performance in Japan, so we\\'re not expecting much in terms of improvement in the overall market environment in Japan.  We do think that it could be a market which often will respond to new technologies and innovative new products. So we do hope that we do hold out hope that we could take some share from our new intros coming out in the second part of this year of an overall market perspective, we\\'re expecting remain some dude in our internal forecasts are not are not based on any type of material improvement on our performance in Japan. Okay. Thanks for that color. And you teased some new product introductions in the back half, that should be meaningful to growth. I\\'m sure you don\\'t want to give away any secrets. Could you sort of help us with what part of the business you\\'re anticipating seeing the boost in 2017? Yes, so thanks for the caveat on your question. So what we can point to it great confidence and clarity is the recent introduction we made in analytic. But I would say to you, you will see broad based introduction the cross the entire portfolio and who are growth essential to our business plan as you know I came in last year, we spent a lot of time, we were realizing in our R&D structure and also reallocating where we put money and I think we’re going to start to see some of that starting to pay off as we go into a later part of 2016. So we did want to put a teaser out there and but also just make sure you have confidence in terms what’s behind our view of improved Agilent performance in 2017 second half of this year, but I think you can expect to see is talking about acting to the cross all three business groups. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Shankle of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.  Hi good afternoon. Mike, I want to go back to some of the comments you made, on efforts to tighten cycle times from order to revenue, which seemed to be yielding benefits sooner than expected, particularly in China. Can you provide a bit more background on this effort, and why it was most impactful in China? And then maybe talk about similar efforts under way in other geographies? And relatedly, you positioned these, in answering some questions, as if they were temporary. At least it seems like your guidance doesn\\'t treat these as sustainable improvements, yet everything else you said suggests that these are truly sustainable improvements. So I was just hoping you could help us understand that a little bit better. Yes, sure Doug, I really appreciate the question. And maybe may start with the last part of your question which is the takeaway here we do believe this is a sustainable improvement, so in my mind the language I use this is the new normal in terms of ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this is new normal how we\\'re going operate so how do we get here and why did they look so significantly different in China, so first of all starts with looking at the entire process from an end to end customer perspective from the time of order placement of shipment into custom installation occurs.  And as you know when I restructure the company I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very siloed or an approach to this end to end process from a customer respective, in the company we looked at each slice of the process, but nobody looking at the collective process and then you start doing that and you start seeing where the issues are the opportunities are so we found ways to improve our order linearity, we’ve improved the quality of booked orders and this really gets to your question about China often you\\'re dealing with letters or credit issues and then other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turn them into revenue. We call the delivery box, we\\'ve been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all our shipments so we improve our ability to get in orders in a linear fashion. Make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework. And then we have improved our delivery performance and then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end to end perspective and the result has been a significant improvement in a cycle in orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating and again as I mentioned in my remarks it did create some, it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter but I think we’re delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficient improvement in place so, that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future. Okay. That\\'s really helpful, Mike. But just to be really clear, recognizing these are well-learned sustainable improvements, it\\'s not apparent that this is fully - these improvements, the sustainability is fully reflected in guidance? If that\\'s the case, is that just because you want to see this play out for a couple of quarters before you start baking it in? I think the confusion might be that what we have stated is that this quarter in Q2 we got $20 million to $25 million of revenue that we had anticipated to be recognized in Q3 as a we were bringing all those program to fruition. We had earlier results which is great from where we are now, the order to revenue cycle time is sustainable but we will not see further improvement that will bring Q4 revenue into Q3 or what already is. So the 022 to 25 that’s the one time we’ve got to the level we wanted to be at and from now on it’s just business as usual without any fundamental change in the order to revenue cycle time.  All right. Thanks for that, Didier. Just one last one for you. On the change in Lasergen accounting, was there any dilution in the quarter, and based on the accounting change, should we no longer expect this to be a $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive deal for the year? Yes, correct, you are correct. So, there was no dilution in Q2 and it will not be in a dilution in for the rest of 2016 or 2017 until we exercise our call option and then we will just fully consolidate if we do that obviously - fully consolidate the Lasergen revenue. So that’s a change that, there was a lot of I mean discussions with the auditors, they surprise us a little bit by going to national to get especially some kind of challenge kind of the accounting that we had anticipated locally among the two teams and then we agreed to the recommendation and therefore no dilution to EPS coming from Lasergen in the next two years. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Yes, hi good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe if I could focus on operating margins again for a second. Just help us, remind us, there\\'s a lot going on there, in terms of the programs you have in place and improvements you have going on. Help us, remind us, the bridge between fiscal \\'16 and fiscal \\'17, what gets you to the 22% operating margin? But what I can share with you conceptually is that we will be continuing and completing off the integration of the Darko acquisition. We have a series of operational programs we talked to about one of those already which is the implications of the ERP and the continued focus on gross margin for its specifically material cost reductions in logistics savings. So, I think that combination of those three factors plus with the overall core growth assumption that will currently model around 4.5 get us to the 22. Okay, great. And the strength in the food market, was this all China, or are you seeing strength elsewhere as well? Actually it was both in food market, both in China and in the United States. As you may recall from Q1 announcement this business tends to be little lumpy whereas I think that performance in food market in China has been sustained but we saw a nice rebound in the U.S. in the second quarter. Got you. Okay. And maybe finally, give us your view of the M&A pipeline. We\\'ve seen you do a couple of deals just recently here. Now that you have many of the operational initiatives for the new Agilent in place, should we expect that you\\'re more active with the tuck-ins going forward? Again this is teaser number two, which is we’re going to talk about this little bit more detail on next week but I do feel that the company’s foundation has really firmly established and as I mentioned earlier, I think we’re getting lot better in terms of speed they have to integrate but what I think you inspect to us do still remain disciplined and focus in terms of finding those opportunities that makes sense for us and I would ask you to think about as been complimentary M&A in nature, we’re going to continued to look for those. So, our balance sheet is a huge asset for our shareholders in one which you like to deploy relative to M&A but it has to be the right target. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two clarifications on how you\\'re thinking about the 2016, 2017 progression. The first is actually on the NIH. To what extent, if any, are you anticipating a pickup in the research channel from NIH funding, when we start to see that get disbursed in the second half of the year? And then second, this may be even a longer term question, but how do you think about the evolution of FSMA regulations in the food space in the US? Is it too soon to start getting incrementally optimistic about how they could contribute to the outlook? Thanks. Yes, thanks glad to adjust both of your questions. So on the NIH front I think we talked about the uptick in the sort of our improved confidence about the spends in Academia and Government in the U.S. I think we do think that the NIH stuff will start to flow through to our business. Relative to some in our space we don’t have as a higher percentage of our business tied to the NIH but it will be a positive for us and I think again one more fact pattern which points to continue to - this market will be solid for us as we move into 2017. I think I have to agree with the comment which is - I think it’s always too soon to get overall excited about this from a U.S. spending, I’ve seen this before where legislation is announced and there is a lot of fanfare about it, but we don’t obviously a backed up by investments although we did – we\\'re seeing some looks like some may be more friendly government allocations to this agency unlikely to seem to the EPA. So, we’re not expect anything dramatic to occur differently in the market because of this but if it would that would be clearly good news for us. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Thanks for the question. Mike, on the margins, overall a really good quarter. Then when you look at the margins in DGG and CrossLab, basically flat year-over-year. I guess, is that what you were expecting? Anything that you could call out in the quarter? I know there\\'s some moving pieces in that topline. It’s a great question and the answer is yes, preciously what we had expected one of the obviously - there is from one quarter to next that could be some one time add-ons that adds a little bit of volatility. For example last year both the ACG and DGG had very favorable hedging gains which have gone away for the whole company the hedging gain last year into two was over $7 million and this Q2 was about $1.5 million. And it was mostly in the ACG and DGG and there are other onetime items including regarding the allocation of our shared services among the different businesses which explain but both businesses are on the way to contribute to the operating margin expansion and 22% that we\\'re committing too. Didier we also ask Mark too. We talked about this earlier this last week as well about spending operational efficiency improvements underline were booked to be flat margins that will field back hedging gains other things are actually some real operation stuff. Thanks Mike and Didier. As Didier said, there were several things that were factors in it last year that didn’t come into play this year but we were working on lot of things in terms of improvements, the mixes is somewhat favorable in the context of what we\\'re selling but overall when we look our plans for the first half we are up 70 basis points in the first half over last year. So, our ability to actually due to margin improvements when you pull back and look in the first half regardless of all those things is quite positive. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. Thanks guys. Just had a quick clarification from earlier. So you were talking about the replacement cycle in biopharma and quoted 150,000 LC systems, based on the 1100, 1200 platform. Can you clarify if that\\'s what you think the opportunity is ahead of you, or that\\'s the opportunity in progress? And if so, what - how far are you into that? This is Patrick, let me answer these questions. First and foremost this is not biopharma, this is pharma and biopharma compliance. And when I talk about 150,000 systems out there, it\\'s to installed base of LC systems in all markets. So it\\'s not only in pharma and biopharma, but we think it is the biggest push is actually right now coming from pharma and biopharma. And I would still see we are in the midst of the replacement cycle, and we don\\'t see that to be over in the next couple of quarters. So is a healthy demand and we are in negotiation is a lot of work for our core customers on upcoming replacements and how we place these systems and how we plan it out for them, so it works for them. And Dane if I could add just one other comment to Patrick\\'s response, we\\'ve been focusing a lot in today\\'s call on pharma and biopharma, but you know keep in mind that the replacements like been very, very subdued on the implied market side in the chromatography. So we have several - we have tens of thousands of systems on that side of the house as well. Again this is why we look out in 2017 and 2018 we think that our growth rates are sustainable. On the pharma side probably anything five or six - I think is and my point would be that I think the ball game and this getting started. Maybe in the first inning, we hope to be in the first innings soon that cycle on the implied market side. Thank you. And I\\'m showing no further questions at this time. I\\'d now like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you everybody and I\\'d like to thank you all for joining us today on the call. If you have any questions of course please give us a call in IR and just would hope that we\\'ll see you next week at our Analyst Day in New York City. Thanks again. Bye, bye. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s program, Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent’s third quarter conference call for fiscal year 2016. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier’s comments will be Patrick Kaltenbach, President of Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call. I’m pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now, let me highlight three key results. First, Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high-end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high-end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. As for the third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter: the pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remains strong. In the chemical energy market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China’s double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, life science and applied markets group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG’s new products. We’re seeing very strong demand for the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC Systems. The 1260 systems were part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new – two new 7000 Series Triple Quad GCMS analyzers, one for pesticides and another for environmental pollutants. And we continue to strengthen our ICPMS market leadership with a new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICPMS System. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis. Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG’s operating market for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. Portfolio expansion efforts also continued in ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leading in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provides services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent’s portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market. Finally, we saw continued momentum in the diagnostics and genomics group, where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics market. Our pathology business continues on a steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 Companion Diagnostics. Growth in genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our Array CGH, target enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our nucleic acid solutions offering. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. Q3 highlights for DGG include the announcement of an expansion of intended use of our PD-L1 pharma DX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously approved in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer, and in the U.S. with patients with melanoma. We also announced $120 million investment over the next three years to expand production capacity for our nucleic acid solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build a factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid, active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business. Now, I’ll provide an overview of Agilent’s core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw 6th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geography except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. Applied end market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in the environmental market for both instruments and after-market products. This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. Now, I’ll turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward and simplified our Company’s infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the Company’s financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent’s systems infrastructure that would deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. In summary, our multi-year Agile Agilent Program continues to simplify the Company’s business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our cost. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017. On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends, and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth, while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. At our recent May analysts meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model, outgrow the market, expand operating margins, balance capital deployment.  Let’s look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in four years, while increasing adjusted operating margin 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of disynergies from the Company’s split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first three quarters of 2016, the team has delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectation despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns. We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deploy capital in a balanced matter, buying companies that bring new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team, combined with Agilent’s scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. Looking at today’s overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending environment end market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. Against this market drop, we are well positioned to capture growth in these end market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously-raised full-year guidance of 2016 and our longer term goals. Our one Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered higher core revenue growth, operating margin and earnings per share than the high-end of our guidance. Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year’s amount, which gives us increased confidence that we will achieve our previously-raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million, or 1% versus previous guidance, and $7 million, or 0.7% versus last year. It had negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially. Now, to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance: at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year 2015. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation, and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. Hi, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for the time here. I want to start with the one regional trend that seems to be on many people’s minds, which is what is going on in Europe. I wonder if you could speak to the trends that you saw in Europe over the course of the quarter. To some extent, it is a macro question, to some extent, it is research question and of course, there is their UK referendum that’s still out there. So I apologize for the nebulous nature of it. But any color on how Europe progressed over the course of the quarter would be really helpful. Thank you. Yes, sure, I’d be glad to provide some insight there and then I’m going to actually have Patrick jump in on this conversation as well, I think, given your recent travels in the region. But what we saw in the quarter was, obviously, a lot of the big macro events. The Brexit, Turkey, there was a number of develop in the quarter. We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say, though, it is raising an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe and we’ve seen questions around when will budgets be released. So it is more of an uncertainty of question right now. There are people who are just sort of waiting and see how it is going to develop, again no material effect on the third-quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously this influenced us to think about how will Europe develop through the quarter and, Patrick, I know you and I had a pretty deep conversation about this yesterday, so any additional thoughts you would like to add? Yes, thanks, Mike. Talking to our field, local feeder in Europe, you’ll certainly get the feedback there, is some uncertainty, as you said. The Brexit had, with some of the government interviews, no deals had probably some minor impacts. I think what is concerning us here a little bit is also there are a couple of other countries standing on the side lines and have other referendums this year. So we are cautious right now. We’re looking at Europe and the growth in our end for Europe for the remainder of the year and also going into fiscal year 2017. Thanks so much for all that color. And then one bigger-picture question, Mike. You made a pretty significant investment with a pretty long horizon, long-term horizon on this facility in Colorado. So it speaks to your confidence in the long-term outlook for and the scale of the opportunity there. Can you just talk us through how you frame the opportunity, remind us how big that business is today, and how you think about the medium-term drivers that you’re investing in the pursuit of? Thanks so much. Great. So I’m going to handle – you’re quite welcome – I’m going to handle the first part of this question and I’ll turn it over to Jacob and he’ll reassure you about the long-term growth potential, which is the reason I supported the investment. But this is a reminder, this is roughly about 5% or so of EGG’s overall revenues in the range of maybe $60 million plus or so. We still have capacity at the current site, but we’ve got a more demand that we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can’t bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018. And I think as you’ll hear from Jacob, there is a high degree of confidence that the business is going to be there and perhaps you can probably a little context of what exactly is this business, and why we are so confident that the market is going to be there for us. Yes, let me try to provide a little more color there. So first of all, a reminder that the nucleic acid solutions division business out in boulder is providing only go APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with significant potential. These drugs are primarily right now opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there is no treatment and have devastating outcomes and these drugs have actually opportunities to change the expectancy of you could say the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma with these new type of drugs and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize all those performance and consistency combined with our ability to scale in GMP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we’re currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. Well we also see that that will run out – that opportunity is really limited and we’ll run out in a few years from now. And thereby the new investment and the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on to place the site in close proximity into the other  approximately 20 minutes ride away, so we can leverage critical mass highly experienced staff that we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now and it is growing something between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drops – when you get the commercial drop, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies. I know you have one more quarter to go here, but any initial thoughts on the puts and takes you’re saying, how we should be thinking about fiscal 2017? Yes, Jonathan, I would be happy to share my thoughts here. In fact, I perhaps will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks, but we are still seeing ourselves in the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York, I think it was actually two months ago now, I think about it. But our position remains the same. We’re still confident that we’re going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there is really are some new factors that we think support this level of growth. First of all, we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY 2017 on top of what we’ve already introduced this year. We think our customers are going to be really excited about what we’re bringing to market and that’s going to help drive share. So we know we got this MPI pipe gone through the system right now with releases coming up in the several quarters on top of what we’ve done. The second thing we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half – I think it is 52% less when I do the math of Agilent’s revenue, these are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams. And you saw in the our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth and they are not subject to the same types of issues we’re seeing in the capital intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I’d say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma in China market is going to remain significant growth drivers although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we’ve seen in 2016. And as mentioned on our last call, we still expect that the chemical energy market will have bottomed by the end of calendar year 2017. We’re not ready to…. Excuse me, sorry, thanks. Didier, I got my ears confused there. By the end of calendar year 2016, we’re not ready to call bottom, but we do see in 2017 that we’re forecasting that we could be in low single-digits growth in a market we just had 18 to 24 months of pent-up demand for equipment that supports the production process. So those are the three factors that have gone into our thinking as we have thought about the 2017’s growth rate. Honestly, we’ll give you the official guidance at our next call, but I would just reinforce our view today is that we’re still on track to what we told you in May in New York. Okay, that’s helpful. And just one quick follow-up. On the capital equipment business I know you mentioned going into the quarter last time when you gave guidance, you thought there had been a little bit of pull forward and you highlighted why you thought it would be a little weaker. I’m just curious was it in line with what you thought or are there anything unique in the quarter or maybe wasn’t right along the lines of what you thought? Absolutely I think the quarter was actually in line, actually little bit better than we had anticipated coming in the quarter or so. No major surprises in our Q3 results. And as you can imagine, we were delighted with the ability to deliver above our expectations both top and bottom line. Hi. So I just wanted to ask about the LSAG business and some of the moving parts there. And could you maybe just talk about the chromatography markets that a couple of your peers have really have had nice results there. Just what you’re seeing there would be helpful. Yes, absolutely, happy to do so. As Mike mentioned earlier in his remarks, we did receive very strong growth right now in the liquid chromatography business, which has been for the entire year double-digits and that is what we see clearly also taking market share right now. We had a very strong launch of several waves of infinity series starting in 2009 and 2012 and now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in chromatography that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well and it is driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% bankruptcy compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors instrumentations, which makes  very simple and seeing this for our customers. So and we will check this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don’t see yet a lot of momentum. What we see, of course, is we’re getting now into quarters with tougher compare those with double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we’re seeing there is that the core market or one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space and that of course pull some of our results down at this point in time. If the market comes back, we think we are in an exceptional position to pick up this pent-up demand. Yes, when the market comes back, sorry. So I think we are in a great situation there as well. We have an outstanding product portfolio and ability to capture the growth when it comes back. Yes, and the reason why I asked Patrick to segment his remarks in liquid chromatography and for gas chromatography, we have an outsized exposure in gas chromatography and when the relative to the number two competitor in that space where at least two access the number two person. And so when our major market is down, it really hits us. And that is why, again, we’re really quite pleased to be able to deliver the growth we’ve done so far with our number two market actually being down below our initial expectations coming into this year. Yes, that’s really helpful and I appreciate all of the details in the different segments. If I could just follow-up with one more, the Americas growth negative 1% in the quarter. I know it is on a tougher comp relative to last year but could you maybe just talk about the mix of the end markets there and whether there was any other notable changes worth pointing out? Thank you, guys. I think the big one there is the chemical energy markets. So it’s down pretty sharply and I think that’s bringing down the overall numbers as well as our academia and government business was down over last year. So, we think some of that – the way we’re thinking about our plan for the rest of this year, we think the federal money will be there in the fourth quarter for us. Yes. And then in addition if I might add that we had a very strong quarter in Q3 last year in Americas. So it is a tough compare.  Thanks. And maybe first on just on the academic trend because it is a big swing from what you reported last quarter. I understand the Europe dynamic, but frankly what we hear from you it was a little bit different than we heard from most of the other life science peers. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about why you felt more pressure in Europe academic than maybe most of your peers? I think I pointed two factors. I’m not sure exactly what all our peers are saying about Europe. I think they’re probably saying the same thing, which are the European budgets are constrained and funding has not been released and is actually withheld in some situations. I also think you may be hearing more positive spin on the U.S. environment because of many of our competitors have much more business coming from NIH. So there is a lot of positive view of the NIH budget but we pick up a relatively small piece of that overall budget. The agencies where we do a lot of our business in the U.S. government, we know the money is coming in the fourth quarter. Anything else you’d add to that, Patrick? I think the biggest dynamic there is a sub segment within environmental as well where we pick up our forensics business and we report externally just a point on environmental business, but a lot of big deal activity in forensic. So, last year, we had a lot of big deals at this point in time. Our environmental market is big deals in the second quarter. So it is really a forensics-driven phenomena which is where we didn’t have as many big deals in the third quarter and, you know, this business tends to be a little bit more lumpy than our base environmental business. Okay. And then last one, little bit of an esoteric question, but on the PD-L1 datasets in front-line alone, can you maybe just talk about whether there is kind of any change in your outlook. Obviously, we’re tempted to go without a companion of sales markets doing a companion too. So, can you talk about whether some of those developments have changed your view of the market opportunity overall. Sure, Tycho, in fact we just had a conversation on this yesterday. So, Pat, I mean Jacob, do you want to share latest thoughts from Agilent on this topic? Yes, I say, first and foremost, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen over the PD-L1 over the last 10 months and we continue to see strong traction. You’re right there has been some announcements recently on some studies that has not come out as expected. It really supports our thesis about the importance of CDX and really that you need to make sure you stratified your patient group give the right way. So, clearly, there is a short-term opportunity at least from one of our customers that is little less than we hope for, but I don’t think that that overall change really the thesis and we continue to see a big opportunity here. Hi, good afternoon, guys. So it seems like most of the confusion we’re hearing is sort of on the sequential progression of core revenues. And so, I look at over the last two years, it looks like sequentially the comp is roughly, I don’t know, 200 basis points easier on core. It looks like you have a little bit heavier of an NMR headwind in 4Q than you did in 3Q. So one can you confirm that? And then, two, as we just think about the crosswalk, what are the other sort of underlying assumptions in terms of what is different sequentially versus 3Q, whether it is end markets or any of the key segments, and then where have you built in, I guess, some conservatism or some of that uncertainty. Thanks for the question, Ross, and why don’t I go ahead and just share with some thoughts about the Q4 guidance and Didier, maybe you can dig into your notes on the NMR impact. But I think it is important for me to share with the audience here today how we thought about our Q4 guidance. I think This may get to the root of some of your questions. As you heard on the call, first of all, we’re quite pleased with higher than guided core revenue growth that we delivered in Q3 after having raised last, in last call, and I think we’ve got this increased confidence to achieve our previously raised core growth guidance for the year. And, listen, we realize by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise, but the way we looked at it, we said, listen, there is a raised level of uncertainty in the market centered around Europe. And, you know, we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We have seen some, you know, downward revisions in terms of market overall economics forecast for Europe. So we’re really not sure exactly how that’s going to develop. So we just thought it is prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising again the full-year guidance. So that is how we thought about the process. We really didn’t look over the years sequentially. We do know that last year, though I said I don’t like the tough compare, but we did have a blowout fourth quarter last year, but anything else, Didier, you can remember unusual… You pointed out really what we intended to do is maintain the overall core revenue growth for the whole year and that’s how we derived Q4. We’d raise last quarter, and business is developing in the third quarter actually better than we had thought as you saw in our results. If you look in the fourth quarter, listen, we don’t know how this Europe is going to play out, so let’s just be cautious as opposed to raising again for the quarter. So that makes total sense to me, Mike. I mean, I think given some the uncertainty, certainly I don’t want to get in front of your skis and you guys have been beating numbers so that’s good. I guess as you think about the key product cycles for the business, how do you think about the cadence now that you’ve had some releases of when we could start seeing that, also draw up the core growth overall. And then, secondarily, when do we start to, you know, comp through, you know, we’ve now I guess comped through some easier compares, you know, on the diagnostics business which has been going hot for, I don’t know, four or six quarters now. How long do you think we’ve got left on that trajectory of sort of high single to almost double-digit growth in that business. Thank you. I think there for the foreseeable future, we’re highly confident on the growth rates in this business and that’s why I made the comment earlier about, hey, when you think about Agilent long-term growth perspective, you think about 17, think about that we have got over half of our revenue in markets that are going to have a steady trajectory of growth. And you heard Jacob talk about what is going on in the companion diagnostic PD-L1. That is why I wanted to highlight the investments we are making in NASD which is a part of the business we haven’t really talked a lot about with you.  So I think it is a lot of Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing, there’s a lot of fundamental very attractive markets. We have a strong position and so Jacob, I don’t want to necessarily speak for you but I guess I have, we expect this growth rate will be sustained. Anything else you want to add to my story? You’re absolutely right. And I’m definitely pleased with the excellent growth last quarter, we had 5%. So I really want to make sure that – you saw that we were – when we talked also at the Analyst Day we believed the right direction is 6 or 7 and I’m happy to beat that. But we do not see any change in trajectory right now and we’ll continue in those high single-digit growth rates going forward. And Ross, I think perhaps earlier question was around product cycle replace. Yes, so I think as you may know, when I came into the role little over a year and a half ago, we had really spent a lot of time, redirecting our R&D programs, we’ve restructured the company, we reorganized our R&D programs. And I think you’re starting to see the cadence. So you’ve seen some of the products come out. We highlighted earlier on the chromatography side, some updates, and new products around spectroscopy, ICP-MS, we know this cadence is going to continue throughout the next quarter and into 2017. So that is why when I got the earlier question about, hey, what are you thinking about in terms of 2017? I know what is in our road maps and I know what is coming to the market over the next 12 months and I know what has already come to the market and I know how customers are responding. That’s why we have this level of confidence about our ability to continue to grow this company in what has been barely mixed market conditions to say the least. My first question, I guess both are going to be on guidance. So for fiscal Q4 your guidance essentially tells us that you’re assuming operating margin declines year-over-year in fiscal Q4 and despite of what seems like could be a, I guess, mixwise a pretty favorable quarter year-over-year, based on your commentary. So, keeping that in mind and the fact that you’ve actually expanded operating margin year-over-year I believe six straight quarters, can you just explain why this makes sense? I think you’ve got the string of consecutive quarters, the six quarters in a row and Didier, we looked at this, I think it is purely volume related but… Yes, absolutely. As same thing for operating margin approach as for revenue approach, we wanted to maintain full year operating margin because obviously it is linked to revenue, so we maintain our core revenue growth assumption of 4.5% and our operating margin assumption of 20.4%. Now you are absolutely correct that that would mean that 50 basis points reduction from the significant operating margin we had in Q4 of last year of 21.5%, it is still a significant 70 basis points sequential improvement and you have to take into account, as Mike said that, this is based on only 1.2% of top line growth. So, a slight reduction in operating margin still very significant increase sequentially but slight reduction related to the one, the assumption that we’d made on the top line growth of only 1.2%. Yes. So I guess that is a segue to yes, I guess the second guidance question. And I don’t mean to be redundant here, because there has been a lot of questions on this already, but I’m going to ask anyway. I mean your guidance is for around 1.2% core revenue growth in the quarter. If we think about this by end market you actually have an easier compare in environmental forensics, academic government, and food relative to certainly what you had in fiscal Q3. Diagnostics is a little tougher but you have some real momentum there. So if we just kind of to make it simple assume all those end markets grow 3% to 5% and net chemical and energy is down mid-singles it would imply that you guys are thinking pharma is only going to grow low-single digits maybe at best in Q4. It is a tough compare in pharma in the quarter. But you’ve talked about continued strength in pharma in fiscal 2017 in response to an earlier question. Again recognizing the uncertainty you talked about in Europe, this is I guess some of this is hard to reconcile and can you help out a little bit and specifically again what are you assuming for pharma in the quarter, is that because of the compare and what is your assumption for Europe growth in the quarter. Yes, sure. Glad to walk you through this Doug. In fact we spent a lot of time modeling our end market views for the rest of the year anticipating this might be a question that would arise. And as I recalled, Didier, I think that we had a less optimistic view relative to academia and government than I think Doug’s math was – where we were seeing, we’re concerned about Europe. And we had – we basically had a flat for the year and I think we still have pharma in double digits. If you are going to just may be a little walk-through. Yes, maybe – I mean again considering how we explained how we came up with the Q4 guidance, the makeup of the Q4 guidance by market is we are assuming that academic and government and chemical and energy will show the same core revenue growth reduction year-over-year as in Q3. So minus 5% for academic and government, minus 4% for chemical and energy. So the assumption is no change between Q3 and Q4. And then for the  pharma you mentioned pharma we are assuming mid-single-digit. And again on a very tough compare and to in line with the way we have been very conservative on the… Yes. As we thought about the company coming in, I think we thought that the pharma growth would be lower. We thought China would be lower and we thought chemical and energy would be higher. In fact what’s happened is pharma has actually been stronger and China is stronger than initially forecasting and you know the story on chemical and energy. Okay. Only thing I don’t think we got there and maybe I missed it, but what is the assumption for Europe in the quarter?  Hey, this is for Didier. It seems like cash flow is something that’s going better than expectations, better than our expectations at least. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the remaining levers that you have to pull on that as you go into 2017. Do you think free cash flow growth in 2017 is really just going to be a matter of earnings growth or is there more that you can do there to improve free cash flow faster than earnings? Yes, there is more that we can do. Certainly the profit before tax is going to be a factor, but Henrik, who heads the Order Fulfillment and Supply Chain organization has also committed to a material decrease in inventories. So that is also something that we’re counting on that will help us continue expanding our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue or a percentage of profit. Okay. And then a quick one going back to one of Tyco’s questions on the forensics end market, of that 12% slice of pie that’s environmental and forensics. Would you be willing to tell us how much is forensics. I don’t think we disclosed that. It is fairly small but enough to move it directly when big deals happen. Yes, thanks. Just had a question on margins and then a follow-up on Europe. On the margin side, thanks, on the margin side, if I look at sort of the components of gross margin, its interesting the LSAG division is your highest gross margin segment in most quarters, but that was one where you saw little pressure. So can you help us think a little bit about kind of the key initiatives you guys have under the hood there to continue to driving better gross margin versus expectations and the same goes for SG&A? Yes, over the last 12 months or 18 months you guys talked a lot about some of the things you’re doing to drive gross margin higher. This particular quarter you had a little weakness in your most profitable segment. So I’m wondering kind of aside from just the top line contribution what you guys were able to achieve this quarter on the gross margin line that allowed you to put up a slightly better result. Great, great. Thanks for the question. So what we’ve been focusing on really are three dimensions around what we call our value engineering program, our logistics model, and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in 2016, the program that Henrik is driving across the company, I think we have probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model, and you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015 that’s no longer the case. In fact we benchmarked ourselves and we got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other two elements of the program or have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering, when you’re re-engineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance, but at lower cost. And then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of that, I think those latter two parts of the program will carry us forward into 2017 and 2018 beyond. So I think that’s how we’re really working the gross margin side. And by the way – whether our comments were focused on LSAG, a lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DGG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in the New York, and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we are now in one SAP instance simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the pharma Dako company into the Agilent environment.  In 2017, where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have improved customer experience there. So there is a couple of big initiatives as well as we’re looking at other aspects of our benefit structure as we made some changes as you may know earlier, for U.S. pension plan, and the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is alive and we have lot of initiatives under way to ensure that we can continue to take cost out by simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that? I would just mention the currency hedging. It had a big impact, it will have a big impact on a year-over-year basis. It is all impacts to gross margin and ACG and DGG, because of their footprint have been more penalized. So ACG on the year-over-year basis lost $6 million on gross margin just because of the hedging programs, and DGG $2 million. So that also explains the difference between ACG, DGG and LSAG. LSAG has a different footprint obviously with a stronger presence in Europe, for example, and so that can be starts a little bit the percentages. That is helpful. Thank you. Just follow up on Europe. I want to make sure, I understand kind of how what you are seeing  to the guidance. And so two items there, one is did the weakness in Europe, did that pick up in the month of July, just given you guys were off calendar versus the peer group. And Secondly, does your guidance assume the academic end market in Europe weakens further as the year progresses or that it sort of stabilizes from here? So nothing unusual in July. And I think the assumption for Q4 is basically a continuation not only worse, but not any better. And we just thought that was a prudent way to think about the Company’s performance for the fourth quarter. I would love to be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong, but we thought from a planning and guidance standpoint we should be prudent in terms of how we looked at the European market overall. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your question please. I’m well, sir, thank you. So a lot of the revenue questions have been asked and, I mean, certainly seems prudent to me, you know, your guidance just given that Europe even in a good year the counter through quarter is always a little bit choppy, anyway there’s clearly some heightments  during this year. So I think it is prudent to be a little bit conservative. But could you just talk a little bit about some of the – I know the share count was a little bit higher this quarter than what you previously guided to are you still looking at buying back 1% of the outstanding share going in to the – going forward. Yes, why don’t you talk about the share repurchase activity in the quarter and how we’re thinking about it going forward, Didier? We filed it back in November 20, I think of last year, the 10b5-1 on an annual basis and we intend to file a new one to register new one also in November of this year. And it is a formula-based instructions that we have provided, you know, between buying 350,000 shares a day under certain conditions to buying zero kind of I think with a cap as you can imagine. So we don’t know exactly how it’s going to play out in Q4, and the only thing that we know is that if there is any kind of shortfall at all in our intended buying in Q4 because of the formula, in the 10b5-1, it will all be carried over into the following year. So we intend to spend exactly what we committed to spend. Great. That’s really helpful. And could you just give us a metric on, you know, what instruments versus consumable growth was in the quarter? I think perhaps the best way to think about it is just look at the respective business groups. You had the LSAG results of down to, and then… Minus 2, plus 8 and that’s why I – as you think about 17 for the Company, if you really want to look at the growth rates of those two business units in the recurring revenue space, ACG and DGG perhaps differently than you might think about how you model the risk profile for revenue projections for the instrument side of the company. Great. That’s really helpful. And I guess could you – when you sort of – you’re still feeling good about the margin target for 2017 and it sounds like that you’re IT initiatives are well under way or finished to do like that. If you still feel confident about getting what you’re expecting for next year for the margin improvement? Absolutely. So that is why I made the statement earlier, because as we said, if we can be in that, you know, 4.5% and 5% kind of growth range, perhaps  it makes at a little bit more challenging but we see the path to 22 is not just around margins – excuse me – not just around margin improvement from volume, but there are specific real programs, something we review once a month and we have active programs and the cost will continue to come out in some of these big programs. Actually I must say I’m really pleased with the team because we went through and did the what we call project NUNU is the finance program we just finished up. And then right on the heels of that we’re going to go live in early 2017 with integration of Dako. So the teams are still energized and working hard and I think it is going to have a material impact on our results in 2017 and that’s why we have confidence about assuming no major change in terms of the macro environment that we can reach what we think are pretty challenging goals but we have a path to get there. Thanks for the question. Patrick, just going back to your comments on share gains and LC, I know you guys don’t like to get too specific on winners and losers but as was mentioned it does look like all the major players are doing fairly well there. So who would you say you’re taking share from is it the small column providers, or does that actually extends to some of the box companies as well. Thank you. Thanks for the question. I can give you only a general flavor here on what we think is going on in the market, I will not comment on the individual competitors but your assumption that the smaller suppliers probably take a larger hit is also our observation. Okay. And then maybe a specific one on C&E, Mike at the Analyst Day you called out, a Saudi Arabian refinery build out that was getting going. Have you started to see some demand there and is that something that you think contributes all to the back half of the year. The major projects that are under way haven’t been cancelled. So but what we’re not seeing any major new projects under way. There is a lot of – there is actually a lot of positive news by a lot of studies about where this market is going, but we’re not seeing – what we’re – just to clarify here. The major project we knew about, whether it be the one I mentioned in Saudi, or there is a major project down in Texas, these programs they’re going to come on line. So people aren’t canceling capacity increased projects, but we’re not seeing a lot of new – new projects, and that’s why we have taken a fairly conservative – probably a pragmatic view of that marketplace. I would like to reminder everybody to, that when we talk about chemical energy over 50% or so is actually chemicals, chemical processing, not directly tied to the exploration of production of oil. Hey, Mike, I guess specifically what is the GC business doing? What is its growth rate? What was it doing in the July quarter? And what is the backlog and what is July or August look like, I guess? Thanks, Paul, I appreciate the question. And as you probably will understand, I’ll give you a more high level resolve because we don’t actually comment specifically at a product category level. Beyond I think, I would just reemphasize the point that Patrick made when he characterized chromatography market, that business is down relative to last year, because of the chemical energy market is down. And we have seen no – no movement at all downward pressure on our share position. It is really a market phenomenon we’re dealing with right now and that’s why when that we place a market does turn we’ve been through these cycles before, when it does turn we will be in a strong position to capture that growth as given the strength of our position in that market which right now happens to be down. And then last on the Applied Markets and in a broader sense, do you think it’s still a GDP growth rate normalized or what do you think the Applied Markets should be for Agilent? We actually don’t think about it that way because the segments that – the segments of the market, like your food and environmental testing, we think are independent to some extent of GDP. So the only way we think about that is relative to it is our chemical energy space. So if you could just kind of think about tying GDP to that sub segment of the company, I think that would be a good place to start but I would not apply it to the whole of the Applied Markets because these are being driven by quality of life investments in the food and environmental area. And I think that’s why – I think this composition of our end markets is the reason why we have been able to put up these kind of growth rates even when our number two market as a company has shrunk this year. And then last on – you had your Analysts Day obviously you’ve been talking about a 22% operating margin. Are you more or less confident that number for FY17 at this juncture? Yes, I think the confidence level is the same as it was back in May, and again I maybe just share a few points here which are we have this confidence of delivery on that given our belief that we can get that growth rate that we\\'re putting the growth rates right now in that territory. We got this pipeline of new products coming out. We have got this nice recurring revenue stream with ACG and DGG that will carry this momentum into 2017. And that we’re interim business going – pharma still looks good. Of course you have these double-digit compare issues. China continues to be strong. Chemical energy has got to turn at some point in time because the market requires these tools to support production. Our thinking is when you look at chemical energy is – we know our customers are looking for productivity improvements to help improve their company profitability. We think that’s a value proposition that Agilent has. We think as they go through their budget justification processes in that budget start and in calendar 2017, that this is why we can say hi listen the decline in this business after 18 months or 24 months will start to turn, and we could see low-single digits by the end of 2017 for the chemical energy market. If that happens, which we believe it will, that will give us the confidence to get the growth and we\\'ll get the margin given both the volume, but also in terms of gross margin improvement initiatives as well as our SG&A cost. Thank you. And our final question today comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Your question please. Hi guys and thanks for the questions. We\\'ve heard a lot of commentary from your peers on Japan, strong pharma environment, weak academic government. So I was wondering if you could walk through your exposure by end market there and what you\\'re seeing across those customer groups. 5%. Yes, just to give you a sense of 5% of the total market. Historically, we’ve been stronger and I can share this from my experience having been the country manager for Japan for a few years in early part of my career. We tend to be much stronger in the chemical and energy segment of that marketplace. We\\'re doing well in the life science research and genomics, but majority of the business sits in the chemical energy space, which has been down. I think Japan is part of that story. Pharma, the pharma business for us is a relatively smaller portion of the market for us. I think they\\'re doing well in pharma but not enough to really drive significant overall growth rates for Japan. Okay, great. And then any color on the progress of Dako integration, what\\'s left to do there, got a nice up margin expansion in DGG this quarter. So are you still thinking that 20% in fiscal 2017, or could there be upside to that number? Jacob has to be sitting by next to me in this conference room. I don\\'t think he\\'s ready to sign up for more than 20% because it is quite an improvement from where we started, but I think he remains quite confident in the 20% achievement of that goal of OM perspective. You saw we had 18.8% operating margin this quarter, up 200 basis points over last year. And the big next wave of integration efforts really will be starting in our Q1 2017. So we have a major program we call it project de Gaulle. We seem to like probably French names, Didier, I\\'m not sure why that may be the case. But and that really will be the next big step to move these pharma Dako company into the Agilent environment. And it will take a little bit of while to get the cost out, but as you go, as you think about exiting 2017, you didn’t have a much lower SG&A spend than you started the year and. Jacob, why don’t you share anything else. No, I think you said it correctly. I just want to reinforce what you said, the cost of 20% – at delivering 20% in 2017 is an in – a significant turnaround of where we were a few years ago. So right now that’s our full aim and I\\'m very happy where the team is and excluding this right now. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I would like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Thank you, Jonathan, and on behalf of the entire management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions please give us call at IR. Thanks, again. Bye-bye. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

I am very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above market growth, revenues of 1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizable 41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeds our expectation. Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. Turning to our full year results, core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%, we increased our operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results show a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. We\\'re capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. In the past year we distributed a $150 million in cash dividend, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested 480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. Let me now address what\\'s happened in our end markets and business group. I\\'ll start with the end markets, our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth has been driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government\\'s decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected while U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. Critical diagnostics grew 8% over last year led by continued growth in reagents. Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market up 3%. Chemical energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017 with no significant downward or upward movements. Geographically, Asia lead by China and Europe was stronger than forecast. Our Asia business excluding Japan grew double-digit driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged we delivered solid mid single-digit growth; European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding were stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical-energy market weakness and specific to the U.S. low U.S. government funding. Moving onto the business groups, life science and applied markets group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. And expected revenues from our analytical lab instrument business, was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new line up of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at pharma and applied food, environmental and forensic markets. LSAG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 22.8% up 280 basis points from a year ago. We\\'re building for the future; in August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on a recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users performed gas chromatography. Industry experts recognized the unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo was featured this month on the cover of LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. Customer response is also very positive to this introduction confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptick in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017 with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters. Another industry unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICPMS System which we just introduced in Q3 has also been well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in lab to demand the highest standard of performance. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver strong sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 22.7% down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations. ACG was also driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our cross lab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratory supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services as customers focus on keeping their order instruments operational. We are investing for the future in ACG, we just introduced a new range that innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab Manager\\'s. Last, but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the diagnostic Genomics Group continued with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improvement previous acquired Dako business is paying off. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates with strong and strengthen reagents and companion diagnostics. Our new clinic asset solutions business for which we recently announced a significant production capacity grew double digit. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligo and nucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DGG\\'s operating margin for the quarter was 19.6% up 40 basis points from the year ago. In October, there was some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck\\'s Keytruda is now approved by the FDA for first line treatment from metastatic non-small cell lung cancers of patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent\\'s pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanding use. This is the first time in Agilent\\'s PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first line testing. The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DGG. We launched the comprehensive offering of poor crystal libraries for functional genomics. This was held accelerate research in the complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent\\'s SureSelect. Solutions, and we broke background initiated construction on the announced our $120 million investments in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity. Turning now to operating margin, we remained focus on operating margins improvements. Since the Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered seven consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first two years of the Company\\'s transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of synergy cost due the spinoff of key site. On the operations front our Agile Agilent Program continues to simplify the Company and lower operating cost. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improved our interactions with customers and lowered our costs. It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. In the coming year, we\\'ve realized cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost savings initiatives. Turning to our fiscal year 2017 marketing and company outlook. As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for a superior earnings growth is throughout go to market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go to the specifics of our Q1 2017 and full year guidance; I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy given the environment of increased uncertainty. This is a change since our last call and the May 2016 Analyst and Investor day. In our end-markets, we expect continued strength in Pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the Food, Environmental, and Clinical Research and Diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty around European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the U.S., with U.S. government policies and spending, and Chemical and Energy markets being the wild cards. Chemical and Energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices, has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued Academic and Government research market in the coming year, until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency valuation discussions could impact our business. We finished fiscal 2016 very strongly, and we are well-positioned for future growth with a rich pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see more clarity on U.S. and European government actions, and have better indicators of when we will return to growth in our industrial end-markets. Predicting end-market growth in today’s uncertain political and economic environment is challenging; however, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market, whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthens us well for the coming year and beyond. The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor day is in full force. The new leadership team -- put in place in early 2015 continues to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. We have improved our adjusting operating margins by 280 basis points over the past two years -- and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017. However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor day meeting, changes in exchange rates, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5 percent. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have internal action plans aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team’s compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance expectations than reflected in our initial full-year earnings guidance. As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We are improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing systems, making the Company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margins. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year performance, both well over the high-end of our guidance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9% respectively, and our OM, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 bps and 110 bps respectively. Our full year EPS, at $1.98, is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage point, which had a 2 cents impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year at $793 million reflects our strong overall performance. Turning to capital returns, for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. I will now turn to the guidance for Fiscal Year 2017 As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year 17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0 % to 4.5%. It is based on October 31st exchange rates and currency has a 0.6% negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year 17 adjusted operation margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year 17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. As you update your models for fiscal year 17, please consider the following 10 points. First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. As we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Four, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Six, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seven, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eight, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Nine, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million, 5 million less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year 16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year 16, mostly due to the investment in a second nucleic acid facility. Now, finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year, versus Q2 last year, meaning about $15 million of revenues shifting from Q1 to Q2. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis, and EPS will grow 7%. As customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front-loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. First question from me is, I wonder if you could just juxtapose your results against from what we\\'ve heard from others in the category over the last several weeks? Sounds like a particularly strong category by a number of -- quarter by a number of metrics. You actually accelerated where we saw a number of others decelerate in terms of organic growth in the quarter. Can you give us from a high level what you think are the keys there in terms of positioning, why it is the quarter was so good for you guys relative to the market? Thanks, Steve. The headline for me was as we looked throughout the quarter, we were winning more business than we planned. So, we win a lot of business in our core market. I think some of the end markets strengths that we planned to was actually a fairly similar to what I\\'ve seen other people comment on relative to the strength of China, strength of pharma continued, subdued, but kind of a stable actually even in government environment. And for us, I think we were just delighted by our performance in particular in our analytical instrument business where we seemed to be winning more business than we planned, and that we think that those well for the strength of our portfolio and so other things we\\'ve been doing over the last year in our channels as well. And then so the follow-up I guess just to dig a little deeper would be did you notice anything in terms instrument trends relative to consumable trends accelerating a decelerating and what is that telling you about end of calendar year budget flash. Thank so much. Yes, we were talking a bit about this yesterday with the team. And if you look at our performance to the quarter, we got off to a strong start in August and continued throughout the quarter. And sometime it\\'s hard to tell other first month where things are lamped for the quarter. But I\\'d say by the end of September, we knew we are letting more business than we planned. There is really shaping up to be strong quarter for us and really position us well for us going into 2017. Mike, just hoping for a little bit more color on some of the expectations in guidance particularly in pharma. Are you still assuming that\\'s kind of double-digit growth next year or are you factoring in a moderation? And on environment you\\'ve managed to grow that business in contrast what we saw from one of your peers last week. So may be talk a little bit about you know contribution from the GC replacement type for next year as well? Yes, sure. You broke up a bit on the call so, if I don\\'t get to the specific questions, please come back to me. But I think relative to the expectations for end market kind of thinking for growth rate, we had pharma below the double-digit growth in place in 2016. So, as we look at our end markets we would expect a moderation of growth, not because the spends are going to go away, but you\\'re really going to start to get into tough comparisons and Didier, if I remember correctly, we were in the mid to high single digit growth for pharma. So in environmental the story really there is China, and we think that\\'s got many quarters in front of us of growth in China. As you know, I\\'m fairly bullish on the prospect of that market and I think we got kind of a perfect storm here going on where we have strong products going into growing markets. Relative to the GC replacement cycle, this is really about what\\'s going to happen in the chemical and energy market, and I\\'ll make a few comments here, then Patrick you may want to provide your perspective as well. So you may have noticed in my call script I went kind of out of my way to talk about a measured ramp-up of our new GC because we think we\\'ve got a winner product on our hands. We know there\\'s a lot of interest from customers but we also recognize the reality of constraints they may have in their capital budgets. I know they\\'re working with their own management teams internally withs these companies about what they may get in terms of funding in 2017. What are your thoughts, Patrick, on that as well? Thanks, Mike. Looking at the GC market, we definitely are positioned very well to capture any growth opportunity there. We have launched Intuvo which is a strong message to our customers that we are standing behind them when it comes to drive for lower cost of management, when it comes to lower cost of ownership, when it comes to increased productivity. And it positions us clearly as the market leader in gas chromatography where we had discussions overtime not only in Intuvo, but I think what in Intuvo launched it for us, it also spread the lot of discussion again about of other part of portfolio to 70 to 90 and other products which are market leading products. And again, the discussion with the customers in the suppressed market is all about, how can we help them increasing their productivity, driving their cost analysis down. And this is where we are exceptionally well positioned to this portfolio. Yes, maybe just to put an exclamation point on this is that we know that the installed base is that historic levels of ageing. We know the equipments being used and it\\'s just the matter of time for that replacement cycle is going to turn on, but as you saw in my call comments, we\\'re not ready to call that yet. Okay. And then just as one clarification on the operating margin guidance half of the cut your down by 1% from where you talked about the Analyst Day half that is for my lab tension at FX. Is that rest just conservatism even kind of the macro? Yes, with the high end is at 21.5 and we are losing about 50 basis points related to the three items that\\'s we had mentioned currently acquisition and pension expenses. And the other thing that to note is as Mike has clearly stated that we have fielding measured on achieving 22% in terms of our variable conversation. Yes, in the way Didier talked about this one was listen, we think we got to pass to 22, but there is lot higher risk than there was back at the last call and at the May AID. So, we thought it was prudent for us to guide this way, but we rollout inside while our comp is tied to the 22% number. Hi, guys. This is Luke Lynch for Ross. Just hoping you could give a little more color on your margin assumptions for next year. What you guys are thinking about pacing the FX headwinds, if any, what\\'s going to be operational, what\\'s pricing, et cetera? I think the question, Didier, was relative to the composition of our operating margin improvements for next year and perhaps we can start with the mix between volume and OpEx and gross margins. Yes, I mean, I\\'m not going to give you the full bridge. When we provided the guidance of 21% to 21.5%, we took into account obviously all the impacts that I\\'ve mentioned. So there is, -- it\\'s based on 4.3% core revenue growth. There is clearly an operating leverage impact and a lot of actions that are taking place to offset inflation and other headwinds that probably I have mentioned. The guidance assumes some level of increased improvement in gross margins as well as a reduction in terms of the OpEx as a percentage of revenue. So you have pretty much on all fronts some improvements, not as much as we had initially anticipated because of the three headwinds that I mentioned. Some of it related to operating leverage and some of it related to the continuation of our Agile Agilent Program. And maybe reminding the audience, Didier, when we first started this march almost two years ago to go to the 22%, we laid out a path which is really around 60% being volume, the other 40% was going to be on OpEx improvements and gross margin. I think we\\'re thinking about the same kind of mix for 2017. Great. And I guess just one more. You guys did really well on the cash flow in 2016. I think 647. You\\'re guiding for 625. Is there any timing impact on that 2017 guide and then I guess on the tax of 2017 what are you baking into that benefit down there? So, I assume when you refer to timing impact, you\\'re referring to special I mean between 2016 and 2017, some cash outlays or inlays that could -- Yes, there\\'s a little bit. Let me just highlight two potentially. In fiscal year 2016, we disbursed $66 million for overall Agilent variable pay and pay for results. Next year we -- but we\\'ve changed our program so that we now do a lot of the cash outlays on an annual basis instead of semi-annual. We had the full brunt in 2017 of improvements in 2016 and the fact that we\\'re going to pay in 2017 something that is more than pertains to 2016. So it\\'s going to be $91 million going from 66 to 91 so an increased capital cash outlay. And then second we did not fund our U.S. pension plan in 2016 so our overall contributions to our worldwide pension plan was $24 million. We intend to fund our U.S. pension plan more in 2017 and contributions to the pension plan will move to 45, so an increase from 24 to 45. So those are the two things that come to mind in terms of explaining some of the variance between 2016 and 2017. Even with those two headwinds we are still showing in our initial guidance a nice increase of $30 million on year-over-year basis. And your second question? Yes, the tax rates, I -did mention at the May Analyst Day that we were going to work really hard on the reducing our tax rate by 2 percentage points over the course of next two to three years. We\\'re very happy to be able to deliver already 1 percentage point in this fiscal year \\'16. We still aiming to reduce our effective tax rate by about 1 percentage point over the course of next 24 months, as committed to -- or indicated I would say in fiscal year -- in the AID but it\\'s prudent to assume that the reduction will come in fiscal year \\'18 and not in fiscal year \\'17. So, in your models, we advise you to put a 1 percentage point reduction in tax rate from \\'19 to \\'18, in fiscal year \\'18, not in fiscal year \\'17. Hi, this is Ryan Blicker on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Would you be willing to provide what your LTMS growth was in the quarter and how that was impacted by the comparison relative to recent quarters and maybe what your annual growth was there? What I can tell you is that back to my earlier statement is we\\'re winning more business than planned. So we\\'re quite pleased with how we\\'ve been doing with the LCMS portfolio and Patrick you may want to remind the audience some of the new stuff that we\\'ve come out with. So, I guess I\\'m not comfortable with giving the specifics of the growth rate, but just give you a sense of trend of the business and maybe a few proof points why we believe as it\\'s going as well as it is. Sure. Again, we are confident that we are outgrowing the market on many fronts. We have a very strong LTMS portfolio. We launched a lot of exciting products at ASMS this year. I think the reception in the market just underlines our strength. The combination of LC and LCMS is important and then we think both are wining platforms. We see strong adoption across all the end markets. If there was one market where we have seen some headwind, then it was probably the pain management market segment, but that is also in line with what\\'s probably have heard from some of our competitors, but overall, we have been very pleased with the result in Q4. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, it seems like there could be a repatriation holiday of some sort in 2017. I believe over 90% of your cash is currently trapped internationally. Can you provide any initial thoughts on how you would prioritize repatriated cash specifically on M&A opportunities and returning capital to shareholders? Thank you. Sure, Ryan. Didier, how about I make a few initial comments and if you want to add anything to it. But first I think we also need to put a series of caveats on my response because we really don\\'t know what this might look like, what strings might be attached to how you can use it, whether you can use cash in a certain way. But, obviously, we would welcome this type of development including a move to a more permanent reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates. That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, we assume with those caveats, I think what you\\'d expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we\\'re managing our current use of capital. So, we would want to use it for U.S. based M&A and we\\'d like to use that in situations where we\\'ve been using debt, such as our share repurchases. So we would be able to finance our share repurchases and then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we\\'d want to do is first of all understand what are the restriction that\\'s could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain. If that particular situation would develop we would bring it back and use the cash very much along the lines of how we\\'ve been using cash with the exception is I won\\'t need to borrow money like I\\'ve done in the past for U.S. based M&A or stock repurchases. I guess you must be okay with that, Didier. You haven\\'t said anything else. Thanks. Mike, so, I was just going back and looking. You did 6% growth organically last year, 6% this year in 2016. Just at a high level, you had some pretty tough businesses in some of the industrial businesses this year and still put up 6. I guess I\\'m just wondering as you look out to 2017, are there some initial thoughts you have around the election from an end market standpoint outside of tax that make you incrementally concerned? Is there -- maybe just high level what makes you think you\\'re going to get that kind of 150 to slowdown year-over-year? Yes, great question, John, and thanks for that. And obviously, we spent a lot of time talking about, this is a team and I mentioned to Alicia before the call I think we may be the first company in our space with had a new guidance after the U.S elections. So, what I am going to tell you is kind of factors we are thinking about and then also give you may be some little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate, we did as a company. But we don’t yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to regulatory market. What\\'s going to happen to our customers in the food markets, environmental markets, the FDA regulatory markets? So, we know there is going to be a customer impact. What\\'s going to happen with U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What\\'s going to happen in the trade agreements? There has been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax and more of the M&A environment change in terms of. So, I can say right now Jonathan is perhaps like everybody else on this call, we kind of as a sense of the issues, but we don’t know which way these things are go yet. So, we are not going to call them. And that\\'s one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent cautious initial guide to FY \\'17. If I look at the end market, I mean pharma is going to continue to be strong, but we don’t believe that it can continue to grow double-digits throughout all of place FY \\'17. So, we\\'ve tapered down our expectations to bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just fantastic for us. I think our number of the year was 21% growth for the year. I am dialing that back a bit to double-digits. So what we are doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we\\'ve seen to be some pretty difficult comparison some market that really have been driving to business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the term on energy. One of the thing you pointed out Jonathan and what\\'s I am really delighted is, we\\'ve had 6% close to 6% growth two years in a row with our number two market declining for eight quarters. When that market turns that obviously will help us in the growth, so -- but I\\'ve learned over the first two years in this job, it\\'s really hard to call turns of the major markets. So, I\\'m not going to and we\\'re just kind of keeping eye on it and will update you as we go through the year. But that\\'s our thinking about how our view in the U.S. elections and thus far behind our end market guidance for next year. Yes, so obviously whether you have 8% growth there, obviously you\\'re probably going to say it\\'s too early to think about how hospitals may react to the potential repeal of ACA. But although the PD-L1 testing business, how much of your growth was driven by that market and can you size that market for us yet? Well, it\\'s I can start by saying that we have been very pleased with the performance of the PD-L1 over the last 12. I think its 13 months now and it has been growing, it\\'s not to our expectation then above even, and we expect that to continue to grow by now based on Keytruda going first line; and obviously now with all companion diagnostic, we would see a bigger demand for U.S. in Europe and in other regions. The market itself is very difficult to size as you know that both been the companion with one drug and then has been into complimentary with another drug and those have very different concise at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size at the HER2 market, but the difference is that HER2 was only one, basically one drug, one glass of drug together with one diagnostics where that the PD-L1 will be up to five different drugs and maybe more, and then five different diagnostic maybe even for a lot of indications also. So, this is as closest I can get to right now, and the market we placed in is that the two companion diagnostics that we have today continue to grow strongly. I won\\'t say that\\'s the overall acting driver for the 8% basically all our businesses today have their very nice close performance, but it\\'s definitely contributing. The pace in the quarter was very good. Can you talk a little bit about backlog and I guess did you pulled, are you ready to pull anything for the first quarter and I mean any unusual spending patterns that you though? Thanks for the question Derik. So, as I mentioned earlier, we saw strength throughout the quarter and we were quite delighted with the results. And we\\'re not specifically comment about quarters or backlog, but I did say in earlier comments that we are well positioned for 2017. I would ask you to think about the Q1 particularly the impact of Chinese Lunar New Year. I told, Didier, he said I don’t want to talk about it in the Q1 call. So, let\\'s make sure that we included in our guide, so that is the one thing that I would ask you to think about in terms of the next three months of the Company\\'s performance. Because we think will probably push about a week\\'s worth of revenue or so from Q1 and Q2 because customers just won\\'t be there to take delivery and as you saw all the growth rates have been really exceptional for us in China. I appreciate the New Years\\' comments. I am just going to follow that up with another question. Are you -- have you had any conversation with your customer that I mean obviously you\\'re not the only trying to figure out what the new world order is in terms of how spending is going to be. Are you worried at all about potential in terms of lower CapEx spending, lower spending beginning of the year as people trying to get their arms around what exactly with the administration have in store? No, actually we don’t have that concern. What we\\'ve been more thinking about as where the things going on long term. So, but in the next quarter, we don’t have any real concern about that. And that\\'s why we are going our full year guidance here in November, and it\\'s really hard to see what\\'s going to happen longer term throughout the year. But in the next quarter or so, we wouldn\\'t expect that to have any significant impact. Doing well. May be just touching on China again, could you may be talk about what your underlying trends have been driving the outsized growth for the Company? Is it bio pharma? Is it food? Is it environmental? And how does that impact as you look to next year? Thanks. Thanks for the question. I have to say really it was across the Board with one exception which is the chemical and energy of market. So, all the other markets were up quite substantially for us and I think this is consistent with what we had talked about in prior call, which is really there is going to be a level of investment in China relative to quality of life issues and environmental, and food lined directly with their five year plan that they were in midst of a major improvement in overall pharma industry, and that there is a lot of money going into to research. And then, I think the reason Agilent has been able to do so well here as we got this combination of we\\'ve working reorganization structure, our China model in the country, we\\'ve had a lot of stability over the last 18 months. So, we got a really strong team there and that combinations of the team are historical strength in China and the new products we have. It\\'s all coming together in terms of growth and I guess let me just add one thing and Mark perhaps you can comment on here. We often talk about the strength of end market and the new products going to this end markets, but I think there is something going on relative to your business there and the move to service is I think worth common as well. Thanks, Mike, and thanks Bill to add little color to that as we\\'ve seen a fundamental shift in buying behaviors in China largely shifting from the core areas at around Shanghai, Beijing, to some of the more tier 2, tier 3 cities where services now is viewed as the common place purchasing item in China. And that\\'s certainly driving the growth, but the breath of services is I think in China as well as the consumable business now is the rest the story, where they have reached the size and scale that they have the same interest that we find in the western market, around the enterprise services and consumable all coming together. So, starting as you mentioned Mike with our extraordinarily strong position to start with, the installed base of China is just allowed us to build the business and truly outgrow our expectations in the second half around this too. Yes, I mentioned, I asked market to comment on that because as you may recall, we really have changed the portfolio composition of the Company much more in the aftermarkets. So, CapEx instruments are actually less than 50% now with total Company\\'s revenue. And historically China has been driven by new instrument purchases. We\\'re seeing increasing growth also come in services and consumables. And then just a follow up for Didier on the guidance, CapEx about 200 million this year, could you maybe just talk about where the incremental dollars are going and maybe what do you think the maintenance CapEx is for as one as a whole? The main reason for the increase which is about $60 million from 139 this year to 200 next year is really the significant increase that we\\'re planning in terms of our nucleic acid facility RNA-based therapeutics and in Colorado. So, we had one facility, we\\'re still expanding the capacity of that facility, but we\\'re building and we\\'ve just started few weeks ago; 20 miles away a second facility that will kind of double the capacity when it\\'ll be put in production end of 2018, 2019. So, that is the main reason for the increase and starting in 2018 we should start, we will see a reduction in the CapEx, this is not the run rate, our CapEx run rate is still between $100 million and $120 million per year. So, this is way above our run rate. I wanted to follow up on the diagnostics business really thought it was a nice quarter on a tough comp. Maybe you talk about the PL-1, but just any more the focus on the Omnis and just whether you think you\\'re picking up steam in the 2017 and anything worth watching on the reimbursement side with that? Jack, thanks for the question, I think I\\'ll pass it over to Jacob, maybe little bit more color on the quarter results. We really continue to see overall in our radiance pick up, driven definitely by Omnis that we see the growth is coming back. It\\'s nice momentum we\\'re seeing, and it continues to -- basically, it continues to increase over, during \\'16. So, with that momentum we expect that we will continue to see a good performance into \\'17 also. From the reimbursement perspective obviously there\\'re already some expectations how that would look like into \\'17 and \\'18, with the Pama  and so on. But now we\\'ll have to see what happens under the new administration here, where that would change anything. But so far, we actually don\\'t expect any significant changes into \\'17. And then just want to follow up on the margin again, and just from our seat what we should be watching? And what would push you to the 22% above the level for this year? What are some of the actions that you think are going to be critical for doing that? I mean, Didier, feel free to augment my response here, but I think obviously it\\'s going to be volume which is about 60% of the margin improvement comes from volume. And the things that we can control, we\\'re on top of. So, it\\'s really that\\'s the one thing I can control is what\\'s going to happen in the market, so obviously there\\'s that 60% tied to margin. And then we\\'ve got some pretty big initiatives in the gross margin area with the water fulfillment team. I think you may have heard me speak previously about some of our work in the value engineering, material cost, reduction in logistics; so I think I also would keep an eye on gross margins as we work through the year. Some of the things take a while to actually start coming through your P&L, but once they\\'re there they\\'re there for an extended period of time. Didier, anything else do you want to add to that? No, I mean, I mean we do have stretch goals as we mentioned, we are paid internally on the achieving 22% and that means all of us have stretched goals to make, to achieve that, to contribute to 22%, and OSS and there is Henrik, the order fulfillment on supply channel organization which has delivered greatly in \\'16 is looking at opportunities to deliver even more in \\'17, which would help us bridge the gap. Yes. Thanks, Didier, and one additional though here as I think it\\'s important to remind everyone is that some of the things are going to help in \\'17 have already been finished in \\'16. So, things such as our simplification of our financial systems infrastructures, so it\\'s done, and now the statement would show up in \\'17. First, question is quickly on the quarter. Curious, if you can comment on pacing, you guys have the off cycle calendar there with October, I am sure everyone curious is whether it was on the capital spending side or any particular end market you thought a meaningful acceleration or deceleration in the month of October? I think you said that pertains other rest of the calendar year? No, Isaac, I just mentioned that what we saw was really strong pacing throughout the quarter, so wasn\\'t -- we didn\\'t see something happened all in sudden in the last four or five weeks. We had strength all through three quarters of our fiscal year close. Got it. Thank you. And then may be a longer term question Mike regarding management incentives. You guys have spent a lot of time over the last couple of years taking about the emphasis on hitting on your margin goals and you guys have done that pretty well. So, as you moved pass that 22% number, I was wondering how you think about evolving incentive structure for the management team? And should we assume that the types of incentives you have in place have been placed maybe with slightly different targets? Or could you overall composition evolve a little bit here? Isaac, it\\'s a great question and I would point back to what we discussed back at the May AID where we really said, but this is really all about is generating superior earnings growth, right. So, if you think about what we are trying to do here is we are trying to outgrow the market, expanding operation margin to keep driving up our adjusted earnings per share growth. So what we\\'d like to be able to do is really that should be the focus of the team as we move forward. Operating margin expansion and capital deployment and your growth of market are ways to get there, so we\\'d like to really be that have become the cornerstone of our long-term focus, and we want Agilent view as a company who grows their earnings faster than revenue. But as I mentioned, the AID is I really want to also make sure that, we don’t get so focus on continue to drive up the operating margin the year in and year out, that you pass something that immediately to say accretive, may be the dilutive on your margins but with good M&A additions to the business. So, I think the way we\\'re going to talk about the Company post \\'17 is very consistent with what we had talked about back in the spring in New York City. Most of my questions have been addressed, Mike, just curious what you\\'re embedding for the government academic market globally for next year? And any color you can give us sort of regionally would be helpful? Sure, Brandon, as we look through my notes here, I think we\\'re expecting low-single digit growth. And I think it\\'s important to kind of parse it out by academia in government. So, we think to go by the major regions right, China is going to be strong. And they\\'ve actually helped to mitigate some of that\\'s been happening in the U.S. and Europe. We\\'re not expecting much in Europe, it\\'s been down, it was down again, but not. It was basically sort of almost feels that the chemical energy market, which is kind of struggling along at a reduced rate. We\\'re not expecting the governments there to do anything in terms of more stimulus. In fact one of the things we\\'re watching us, what they\\'re going to do as a result of Brexit for those things. So, we expect the strong China academic government, we expect the continuation of this current environment in Europe. In United States, the academia side is not bad. It\\'s, what we\\'ve seen more it\\'s been on the U.S. government side. The U.S. government, our U.S. government business is down in 2016 relative to 2015. And that\\'s why in my call I mentioned, we need to kind of see where this new administration goes with its budget plans and investment priority. So, right now, we\\'re kind of standing at the side line as same as it\\'s going to continue to be just like it is, but in the United States, but we could see something different in the few months, we just don’t know. Mike, just following up on the outlook. How are you thinking about the pacing of growth in chemical and energy in 2017, as the assumption that you kind of see some sequential improvement through the year or you basically flat lining to the business across the quarters just given that we haven’t seen much in the way of positive signals? I think you anticipated my answer, so we basically have flat line for the year. And it\\'s been shrinking for last seven or eight quarters, 2% or 3% I think we ended up down about 3% for the full year, and we\\'re basically seeing it\\'s going to be flattish for 2017. If there is any good news to that story as these fundamental industries are still out there in terms of gasoline is being produced, we\\'ve seen record levels production in United States. For example, the plants are running, there is lot of discussion, there is lot of report externally about a turn, Oil prices have been inching up. But our history is here is that it\\'s really hard to know exactly when it\\'s going to turn, what I can say is that, if you have a profitability of productivity message associated with something you can bring to the laboratory then they might listen to you. And we\\'re hopeful that some of our new product introductions will hit the mark there, but in terms of our overall market assumption and growth assumption for the Company, we\\'re assuming flat for 2017. No big movements, one way or another. Got it. Okay, great. And then maybe just to go back to the M&A and the margin comments as we sort of think about the moving parts on the out margin guidance and just what you might look to do this year how at risk is the current out margin outlook from additional M&A? I mean obviously it\\'s tough to discuss these things in the abstract, but are you open to further dilution if the right asset comes along? Or do you kind of think you hold the line of the current forecast? Thanks. I think what we said; I am really trying to be having actions that consistent with our prior communications. We said, we would look at acquisition that could be short-term dilutive in nature. And we did one in latter part of \\'16 when we just love having at last part of portfolio. It\\'s a great addition to the business, but right now it\\'s not that corporate average. We will move it up, so if we saw the opportunities like that we would pursue them. But I think if you want to look at type of the deals and the size and other things, just look at what we\\'ve done so far. To give you the kind of a sense of the things that we\\'re looking at point forward, we like accretive deals and we like one that can move up move with move the margins up. Just quick follow-up, if I could on the pharma and just wanted to understand there is clearly a solid contribution here. If you could maybe help us parse out, is that more coming from service small molecules and macro molecules? Or is this, are we thinking about them directly? Maybe we should be thinking about in terms of the service contract share that you\\'re gaining via the CrossLab Group? Help us if you could parse that out a little bit. Sure. So, there is something going on which is in terms of the overall fundamental end market growth rates, we think bio pharma in the small molecule side of pharma both growing quite strongly. Small molecule side is really being drive by a conversion to the new technologies of liquid chromatography in particular, also an increasing interest in enterprise service what we have to offer from ACG. So, I think that\\'s being going on here for Agilent. We\\'ve had a combination of the really strong end market growth. There is a new market that has and will continue to develop in this services side, and we are doing well there along with our new instruments in the pharma. When I look at \\'17, we think that the biopharma side of that market is going to continue to go quite strongly within an area of prioritization for us in terms of new solutions. But we do think that overtime that the small molecule will start to move back towards more of a long-term growth rate. And Patrick, I think would we kind of think about a long-term growth rates in this small molecule side. Well, on the small molecule side, I think the more and low-to mid single-digits range whereas in bio pharma, we are more optimistic and it continues to be double digits, that\\'s our projection right now. All right. Thank you for that. Just one more in terms of the chemical energy markets, I mean we get the view into 2017, but as you have conversation with the labs and lab directors, so just help us understand. How they are thinking about capital equipment and 2017 knowing this times and knowing that the progression that\\'s been? Or are they thinking more in 2018 terms on the capital equipment? I have to say, I don’t think they really know yet as well. What they are doing right now is they\\'re right in the midst of their capital budgeting process. So, what I can tell you is as I\\'ve had a couple of conversation with customers over the last two or three weeks on this exact topic. And what they described for me is, hey, these are one customer was somebody who provides services into equipment into the energy market. So listen, we are starting to get interest in quotes. But we are not sure where that\\'s going to hit in \\'17 or \\'18. When we had our VIP launch for the Intuvo 9000 GC, a lot of customers from energy had listened. We love this productivity message you have here. I think there\\'s a real economic ROI. I\\'m now right in the midst of my budgeting process inside the Company. And maybe I\\'ll be able to get this improve this year or maybe the following year because there still seems to be the sentiment particularly with the larger companies, they want to hold on to the equipment as long as they can before they have replaced. And so again, that\\'s why I pointed to the fact that\\'s not all negative because of the fact that we do have a strong service in consumables offering into that space. But again, we just don\\'t -- I don\\'t think our customers know yet as well what\\'s going to happen. We do know it\\'s going to happen. History will repeat itself. There\\'ll be a replenishment of aged equipment, but again we\\'re just not confident enough right now to say when that\\'s going to occur. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Thank you everybody and on behalf of the management team, I wanted to thank you for joining us on the call. If you have any questions, feel free to give us the call at IR. Appreciate it very much. Bye-bye. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I\\'m very pleased to announce that the Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter with both revenue and earnings well above the high end of our guidance. We continue to deliver above market growth. Revenues of $1.10 billion exceeded the high end of our February guidance by $42 million and are up 9% on a core basis. Our adjusted EPS of $0.58 is $0.09 above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS is up 32% over the second quarter of last year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, up 270 basis points from a year ago. This is our ninth quarter in a row of improving operating margins.  Let\\'s now take a closer look at the better-than-expected Q2 performance. The story for the quarter are growth well above expectations in the chemical and energy, pharma and European markets, while our Asia business remains strong.  The lead story was the stronger-than-expected pickup in the chemical and energy market with 14% core growth. This comes on the heels of return to modest growth last quarter after 7 consecutive prior quarters of decline. What\\'s driving this higher-than-expected growth in our chemical and energy business? While the exploration segment remains challenged, the growth is broad-based across all geographies and product categories, particularly gas chromatography, spectroscopy and aftermarket services and consumables. Chemical and refining customers are increasing their CapEx purchases. Our customers in material and mining segments have also started reinvesting after a prolonged period of declining sales.  Core growth in pharma, 12% against a difficult compare, also exceeded expectations. Demand continues across our pharma spectrum with highest growth in the biopharma segments and our NASD business. We are seeing strong customer interest in our new offerings and across our portfolio. Our broad and differentiated opportunities in chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, services and chemistries well position us to capitalize on a strong pharma demand.  A few other end market comments. Our food business was up 1% against a difficult compare of 25% core growth last year. Food market fundamentals remained sound. Environmental and forensics were up 7% on the strength in the Americas and Europe. As expected, academia and government market funding conditions remained weak, with our business down 2% for the quarter.  Geographically, Europe exceeded our expectations with 10% core growth. Except for academia and government, European growth was across all market segments with particular strength in the applied markets. Asia growth remains strong at 10%, with China delivering high single-digit growth against last year\\'s growth of nearly 40% and in line with our expectations.  Let\\'s now turn to specifics for our business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 6%. Growth was led by higher-than-expected strength in chemical energy, pharma and environmental. From a product perspective, performance were broad-based across the portfolio with strength in chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and cell analysis. We continue to strengthen our instrumentation solutions portfolio. In large, we introduced the 6495B Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system. This new offering provides greater sensitivity and accuracy for applications such as food safety and environmental testing. We also added to our portfolio of solutions in biopharma with the introduction of the Agilent 6545XT AdvanceBio LC/Q-TOF MS system. This system optimizes results for scientists seeking to characterize biomolecules that could be the basis for new therapies.  As we continue to see the external recognition of innovation and market leadership, at Pittcon 2017, Agilent won 2 prestigious Scientist Choice Awards, including Best New Separation Product of 2016 for the 1260 Infinity II LC system and Best Webinar Series of 2016 for our series on solutions and biopharmaceutical discovery and development. At the Annual Conference of China Scientific Instruments, the gasoline Intuvo 9000 Gas Chromatograph System was selected as the Green Product of the Year and the Agilent 5977B GC/MS system won for the Most Popular Scientific Instrument. At this same China conference for the second year in a row, Agilent was recognized as the most influential foreign manufacturer. Our pipeline of new products are strong, and we\\'re looking forward to the upcoming ASMS Conference on their latest innovations from Agilent.  The Agilent CrossLab\\'s group\\'s strong performance continues with core revenue growth of 10%, well distributed across most regions and end markets. Our enterprise services and consumables growth was standout for the quarter.  Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics group delivered core revenue growth of 13% while driving improvements in our operating margin. Growth was broad-based across pathology, companion diagnostics with particularly strong growth through our nucleic acid, CDMO business.  We continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We introduced a new Target Enrichment Solution for next-generation DNA sequencing, Agilent SureSelect Clinical Research Exome V2. This solution delivers more than 1,000 additional disease-relevant targets compared to earlier version. We introduced Agilent\\'s first CGH assay for diagnostic use, the GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay. This assay will enable to detect genetic anomalies earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.  In a significant win, Agilent was named the primary IHC and special stains vendor for Quest Diagnostics. This is a testament to the advantage of our standing workflow solution. As a reminder, the integration of the former Dako business under Agilent\\'s systems was completed in Q1, and we\\'re starting to see the bottom line benefits of more streamlined cost structure. We are in the early phase of integrating the Multiplicom acquisition into Agilent and even more excited to have the Agilent Multiplicom team to be part of Agilent.  Coming off the strong start to 2017 in the past 2 quarters, how are we thinking about the coming quarters? Let\\'s start with our lead story for the quarter, the chemical and energy market. We are pleased to see two consecutive quarters now of growth in the chemical and energy market. However, it is early, and we\\'re not yet ready to call a cyclical recovery. We do remain confident in our ability to capture market share in this market segment irrespective of market conditions. We are the recognized leader in this space with an increasingly strong value proposition for our customers.  Looking ahead at our other end markets, with the exception of the academia and government markets, we see solid market conditions for the pharma, food, environmental and clinical and diagnostics market. Specific to Parma, investment levels remained strong, but we do expect some declining growth rates due to increasingly difficult compares.  And a few additional comments on academia and government. We are expecting a continued weak funding environment across most geographies with the exception of China. In the United States, recent approval of the U.S. Federal budgets through September is an encouraging sign, but we\\'ve not set -- we have not yet seen funds being released.  Geographically, we expect the U.S. and China to grow consistent with prior expectations, while the growth trajectory in Europe is uncertain. The outlook for Europe is highly dependent on the macroeconomic environment continuing to improve. We do not expect European government and academia spending to improve, and we are taking a wait-and-see approach on the European chemical and energy market, both major contributors to overall European performance.  These cautions aside, we are excited about the company\\'s growth prospects and the steps we are taking to position the company for future growth. We are raising our full year core revenue growth and earnings expectations. Didier will share the details later in our call. Before I turn the call over to Didier, let me close with a few comments.  Q2 \\'17 marked the 2-year anniversary of this Agilent leadership team being put in place and the full initiation of our company-wide transformation initiatives. Over 2 years ago, we outlined a path to increase shareholder value that was focused on outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins on an organic basis and deploying capital in a balanced manner. We have delivered on our shareholder commitments every quarter since then. We have continue to outgrow the market and increase profitability each quarter often in challenging and economic circumstances. We have improved operating margins by 300 basis points during this period with a company-wide drive for continued profitability improvements. During the same period, we deployed our capital in a balanced manner with acquisitions and strategic investments of $547 million, cash dividends of $334 million and share repurchase of $889 million.  Behind these results are an energized Agilent team with a relentless commitment to customers. In our Agilent DNA is our team\\'s ability to drive customer-focused innovation coupled with operational excellence. It is this powerful combination that will continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion.  I look forward to answering your questions later in the call and will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q2 results and updated guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered another strong performance this quarter, 9% core revenue growth, 270 basis points of operating margin expansion, 32% EPS growth and $257 million in operating cash flow even after contributing $25 million to our U.S. pension plan. The revenue performance drove most of the operating margin and EPS performance.  During the quarter, we bought back 1.64 million shares of Agilent stock at an average price of $50.60 and paid $43 million in dividends.  I will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion and EPS of $0.49 to $0.51. At midpoint, revenue will grow 4% on a core basis. As Mike stated, at this stage, we are not ready yet to call a cyclical recovery that assumes the sustainability of Q2\\'s strong chemical and energy and European markets.  Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2017. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $30 million, including $10 million due to currency. Thus, we\\'re increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from 4.5% to 5%. We\\'re also raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.05 including about $0.005 coming from FX. There is no chance to operating cash flow guidance of $825 million and CapEx guidance of $200 million.  It\\'s actually Joel in for Isaac. Appreciate all the chemical and energy end market color you guys provided. But just from a company-specific perspective, could you maybe quantify how much the Intuvo 9000 product cycle contributed to the organic growth this quarter? How about I make a few comments about our gas chromatography business and I\\'ll turn it over on to some specifics on the Intuvo GC launch? So in -- we know the very strong performance in the chemical and energy as well as environmental market for the company in Q2, and a contributor of that was the performance of our gas chromatography business, high single-digit growth we saw in gas chromatography mainly through our 7890 core product line. As you know, we\\'ve indicated in previous calls that Intuvo will take some time to ramp and that we were expecting to be a more material impact on the company\\'s P&L as we went into the latter parts of this year into FY \\'18. So perhaps, you can give a little color, though, Patrick, on how the Intuvo launch has actually come along and how customers respond to the offering. Okay, yes. Thank you, Mike. And so we are very happy with the launch. We have seen exciting feedback from our first customers out there. That said, we are still in the ramp phase with the product. We are still placing a lot of demo units out there. The product is quite different into use -- user interface, et cetera, in used model compared to our standard product of 7890. We have put a lot of emphasis on usability, ease-of-use. So customers really want to touch and see it first before they make a buying decision. And as I said, the feedback is very positive so far from the customers we have seen. We are ramping the product. It has not been a significant contributor to revenues this quarter yet, but we are very confident that we have a real winning product in our hands here, and it will make a more significant impact in the quarters to come. So we are, I would say, bullish on the outlook. But for this quarter, it was not a very significant contributor yet. Very helpful. And then in the context of the revenue and earnings upside we\\'ve seen throughout the first half of the year, are there any R&D programs or maybe channel investments that you guys are accelerating into the back half of the year? I\\'d say we\\'ve been really pretty much staying on our plan on record so -- which, as you know, has been to invest at a higher level on the average in the industry and R&D. And I think I\\'ve been pretty transparent in some prior calls that we also were building a lot -- adding a lot more a channel coverage and specialization, particularly in such areas such as biopharma. So I think we\\'re just tracking to the plan. And as we said, we were delighted by the Q2 revenue results. This is Mike Sarcone in for Dan Leonard. So another question on the chemical and energy end market. I think you mentioned that exploration remains challenged. So does that mean you did see an improvement on the refining side in the energy segment? And can you just elaborate on that and as well as the chemical performance? Sure, happy to. So now just as a reminder for the audience, when we look at our chemical and energy market segmentation, historically, about 15% of our business has been in exploration. And I\\'d say that continues to be down very strongly, so no signs of real life there at all. The other 35% of the total is in the refining area, and we have started to see some levels of reinvestment in the refining. And then also in the chemical side, which makes up the other 50%, we\\'ve seen investments starting up there again. Inconclusive in the space, we also report our sales into the mining and materials segments. So I\\'d say the 85% of the segment shows signs of life, though not yet ready to call a full cyclical recovery. The other 15% in exploration remains down. And if I could just pivot to biopharma. It seemed like through the quarter, end market performance diverged geographically for some of your peers or other tools players with exposure to the end market. And by that, I mean, there\\'s also some underperformance in North America. Did you see any of that in your biopharma business? No, no. Not at all. We saw a strong performance across all geographies, and one of the things that -- and no real notable difference in terms of relative to our expectations. One thing I did try to note in the earnings call was the broad-based nature of our portfolio, which allows us to really capture a lot of the demand there beyond, say, liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Mike, just trying to get our arms around the guidance here. You\\'re calling for 4% core in 3Q against an easier comp after doing 9% this quarter. Is there something that would lead to maybe some extra conservatism in the quarter ahead? Thanks, Tycho. So I\\'ll leave the characterization to our guidance to you. But what I can do share with you is this thinking. I think there really are just 2 major watch areas for us, and why we\\'re not -- and it really is the chemical energy, which, as you know, we put up a 14% growth after low single digits first quarter. So we\\'d like to see another quarter or 2 of that to see whether or not it\\'s sustained. And then on Europe, Europe was 10% growth for us, which, as you know, coming this year, we were quite concerned. Again, we want to see if the economic environment continues to improve there. But we\\'re just sort of taking a watch and see in both these areas as opposed to calling in type of sustained double-digit growth in these areas. What I would say is there\\'s no hidden kind of concerns behind our guidance that we haven\\'t been already discussing. Okay. And then for a follow-up on DDG. Obviously, good quarter there. We saw good standing numbers out of Roche as well. Is there something going on in the end market in terms of improvement there? And can you also talk on the operating margin increase? That was certainly notable. I\\'m sitting right next to Jacob here in the conference room. I know he\\'s delighted to talk about his double-digit growth and his 20-plus percent operating profit performance. So how do I pass it over to you, Jacob? Yes, thanks, Mike. And certainly, we had a great quarter. And you\\'re also right that our portfolio business continues to provide momentum. And you\\'re also right that we see competitive -- the competition also have good performance. From our perspective, we continue to see good momentum from both our Omnis business, so advance same portfolio, but also including the PD-L1, which continues to drive momentum. I don\\'t think we see a shift in the industry right now. One quarter is not making the business. We see more over a longer period of time. But I don\\'t think that we see that because 2 competitors have strong quarter that this is a change in the market environment. But we continue to see overall pathology is a strong market to be in. So I\\'ll actually start picking up on a point, I think, Tycho was alluding to, which is on margins. Didier, could you just give us a sense for what the drop-through looks like on incremental revenue in a quarter like this so we can think about how to fine tune our models best? And then as a follow-up, and it\\'s somewhat related. Mike, you had some experience now of seeing the performance of the commercial team since you integrated the sales force, and you\\'ve had a chance to take advantage of the breadth that you have in a refined service offering. I mean, how are you thinking about deploying those learnings as you see the results coming through, putting the gas pedal down maybe a little bit more? How does that make you think about the rate of OpEx growth for this business as you see the returns on these investments? Yes. And how about I start there? Didier, you can go back to the margin question. Thanks for the question, Steve. And Didier and I have been talking a bit about the future modeling of the company, and obviously, we\\'ll share more details with you later on in the year as we move into FY \\'18. But as you know, we\\'ve been really working down our SG&A levels when we first started the company. I mean, we had a lot of restructuring and consolidation, and we had a significant amount of cost savings. We have been -- and then what we tried to do from there was take the cost out and then invest based on the revenue growth. So we would expect to see the SG&A grow lower than -- and then revenue as we move forward. We\\'ve done a lot of build outs in the lot of the channel. I would tell you, though, there are some things we still like to continue to build out. The academia and government for one is one of the area where we\\'re not yet at a leadership position. So we do have some things on the drawing board where we like to have some additional incremental investments relative to today\\'s level of resourcing. But I think you\\'ll kind of see us stay with the same fundamental model of not cranking up these numbers as a percentage of revenue. And on your other question, Steve. The -- so we continue having exceptional drop-through operating margin incrementals. We\\'ve enjoyed 56% for the whole year last year. I think we had a 47% in Q1. And this quarter, we had 56% similar to what we\\'ve basically enjoyed in the last 6 quarters. So excellent drop-through., obviously, in part leading to the 9% core revenue growth. And I think it\\'s worth adding here, Didier, which is how we manage the company, right? So listen, we\\'re not going to shortchange investments, which we think we can do relative to R&D and channels for future growth. But at the same point in time, we are going to be disciplined with our spending. And I think you\\'ll see that\\'s how we\\'ve been managing the company, and that\\'s why we\\'ve been able to get some of these margins up for the overall company performance. I appreciate all the color there. Just one detail point for me, and then I\\'ll let others jump in. It has to do with the expansion of the plant in Colorado, the oligonucleotide capacity expansion. I wonder if we could get an update there on how that process is going and how we might think about the timing on when that incremental capacity could be a driver, contribution at the topline. Yes, it\\'s actually a very timely question because Didier and I just review with Jacob and the team the progress on the construction. And if you happen to find yourself on Frederick County, we can give you the address. You can drive by and wave to the construction crew there. But construction is proceeding as planned, right on target. And we got through the winter months without a lot of any kind of major disruptions to our construction. And from a -- as you know, this is a pretty complex manufacturing facility. In fact, this will be sort of a one-of-a-kind in the industry given the amount of capacity that we\\'re adding. And then it also requires a level of validation required on the site. So long story. Short of it, I think you should think about this as being an FY \\'19 revenue impact for the company. We do believe that we can continue to get strong growth in our current facility. But as you know, we\\'re going to run out of capacity, so we\\'re looking to bring that online in early FY \\'19. Mike, a question for you. I mean, with 85% of the chemical and energy business trending positively, I mean, what do you want to see before feeling more comfortable calling a bottom there? And any chance you could give us an update on what\\'s embedded in your full year outlook for core growth for that segment? Sure. So part of it is tied to the macro view of a cyclical industrial recovery, and I don\\'t think I\\'d add comments to there yet as well, so it\\'d be nice to have some external validation. And then from an Agilent perspective, I like to see another quarter or 2. My first year in the job, I can remember getting a little overly enthusiastic about a turn in the chemical and energy, and I was only off by 6 or 7 quarters when we first started seeing growth again. So having sort of learned my lesson, I\\'m a little bit more cautious about when to call the downturn -- I mean, the upturn, excuse me. Listen, we\\'ll take the business, but I think I\\'ll need another quarter or 2, and then give me a little bit of the external validation from some of the economists. And I think we\\'re looking at, Alicia, for... Okay. Super. And then one more 2-part question, though. You hired a new SVP of Strategy and Corporate Development in March, I believe. Anything to comment there in terms of your near-term M&A appetite? And then one for Didier. It looks like you took buybacks out of the second half of the year. Any signal or messaging you\\'re trying to share with us there? Yes. So first of all, Brandon, thanks a lot for the close watching of the company, and we\\'re delighted to have Sam Raha on the Agilent executive team. Sam is actually here in the conference room with us as well. And in terms of the M&A appetite, I think you\\'re seeing that we are quite interested in adding new capabilities to the company in fast-growing spaces, and we\\'ve done 4 M&A deals already. One was a strategic investment in Lasergen. We feel a lot of interesting assets out there, particularly in the private space. And given Sam\\'s experience in analyzing industry, we think this allow us to perhaps have an increased level of velocity working through targets. So I think our appetite remains the same, but what we\\'re doing is bringing on additional strong capability to help us through that process. And then I\\'ll pass this over to you, Didier. Yes, Brandon, on the buyback, you have a good eye. We have a very disciplined approach to our buyback program. Once a year in November, we register a 10b5-1, and the approach is both formulaic and opportunistic, which means that we are able to flex our buybacks according, obviously, to market conditions. And the one thing that I would also mention is that this is not a program where you don\\'t use it, you lose it. Any amount that is below what we plan to spend in a quarter is carried over to the next quarter and on and on if needs be. So with that -- last -- we felt it was more cautious with the valuations of the market that we do not forecast the buyback because there is a cap. There is no doubt. The cap was raised 13%. Last time, we raised 8% in November, and we will certainly raise it again as we register the next buyback in a few months\\' time. But we don\\'t know what we don\\'t know, and based on the potential market valuations in that, we decided that for the second half, it was better not to assume any buyback. And obviously, we don\\'t -- we will see what happens. My first question is on China. Just some clean-up there. What was growth in the quarter? Anything interesting to call out by end market? And did the timing of Lunar New Year play any role it and strength in the quarter in China? Great. Always happy to share some insights on the -- on China. In terms of our overall growth, high single digits for the quarter. I think the most thing -- most important thing to note is the compare against the 40%, almost a 40% growth rate, on the prior year. The end market demand continues to be quite healthy there, and we\\'re still on our view that this can be -- this will be a low double-digit growth country for us in 2017. So no change at all in terms of the fundamentals, which remains strong. And to your point about Lunar New Year, really no impact. So it\\'s nice not to be talking about that in an earnings call as a reason for difference in performance. So things are really looking good in China. The market fundamentals are intact there, and we\\'re really quite pleased with the performance of the company, and we\\'re right on our earlier start of the year expectations of growth for China. Okay. And not to beat a dead horse here, but I just want to push you a bit more on guidance. What -- you\\'re guiding the third quarter, as it\\'s been noted, to a moderation against the most favorable comps of the year. And then when you look ahead to Q4, your guidance implies the lowest growth rates since, I think, the first half of 2014. I mean, that just doesn\\'t make a ton of sense based on what we\\'re hearing from you across the board. Either something isn\\'t going as well as it seems, which sure doesn\\'t seem to be the case, or it seems like, at this point after 6 quarters of guiding the levels that are well below what you actually put up that, if we\\'re going to be kind of intellectually honest about what\\'s going on with the business that we should be modeling something a lot higher than what you\\'re guiding to. So with all that in mind, I just want to make sure, they were -- there was nothing in terms of the cadence in the quarter or any timing dynamics that came into play that shaped how you\\'re guiding with the second half of the year. So let me make two comments here then, Didier, feel free to add anything to that. But first of all, relative to anything that -- I forget exactly the terminology is. But anything that could be negative or significantly going wrong with the business, that\\'s, by no means, the case here. So the fundamentals of this company are very sound as well as the end markets. The point I, perhaps, will belabor if you don\\'t mind is with my experience holding a turn 2 years ago in the chemical and energy market. I called it too early, and it never happened. In fact, we drove along for 5 or 6 quarters. We also know that the European market, particularly in the summer months, is not always the strongest. So those are two things that we were watching, and that\\'s the reason why we\\'ve guided the way we want -- we\\'ve done for the second half. By the way, I think our core growth guidance guide for the year is, I think, perhaps at the upper end or higher than any of our peers. So we\\'re already moving out our core growth rate for the year higher than everybody else in our space. But based on our product experience in watching Europe and calling for a turn, a sustained turn in the chemical energy, I was wrong before, so I want to make sure I got it right this time, so we\\'ll give it a few more quarters. Didier, anything else you\\'d add to that? Well, maybe two things. Number one, on chemical and energy, basically, our revenue this quarter was a lot based on the year-end budget flush that -- in terms of orders that we saw among our customers and, perhaps, the beginning of the year. So we don\\'t know how to really read it and if it is sustainable or not for that reason. It\\'s very much related to the end of last year\\'s budget and beginning of this year\\'s budget, and they might not be totally relevant data points. We\\'ll see. And maybe the other thing is that a testament to the great work that our teams have done in terms of converting orders into revenue. I mean, we\\'ve done a fantastic job. The patent order and also -- of orders also has improved tremendously with a lot more orders coming into the first month of the quarter. All that has a positive impact also this quarter among many, many other things. Obviously, what was more important is the great order performance. And we don\\'t -- we are not able to operate with a smaller backlog than we used to back 2 years ago before we put in place this tremendous operational improvements in our managing of the orders. And so there, we have bit less visibility potentially than we used to 2 years ago, but it was not very good visibility. Now, it\\'s better in some way. It\\'s Luke in for Ross. So I guess, if -- we\\'re talking a lot about the Intuvo and your new product pipeline. I guess, can you break out how much of this quarter\\'s growth was due to the new product pipeline? And I guess, more importantly, how has this -- how is your product pipeline that exists now, how does that compare to, say, 3, 4 years ago before Mike took over the helm? So I\\'ll take that last one as well. So in terms of the contribution to this quarter\\'s revenue from new products, we don\\'t actually go through any of those internal calculations. But I\\'d have to say it\\'s been a significant contributor to the growth. So as you know -- and this is a phenomenon that has been growing for several quarters, right, because for the last 2 years, we bring into the market a number of products.  We\\'re talking about the Intuvo right now, but we have the whole infinity two series, a bunch of new spectrometry products. So we\\'ve been coming to market. Jacob\\'s team has been inducing a new genomics offering. So I have to say our business model is based on the ability to get to market new solutions that are differentiated and really do make a difference for our customers. That\\'s our business model, and I think that\\'s what\\'s been part of the reason combined with our extended channel, which we\\'ve been able to grow the way we\\'ve been growing. And -- but it may seem like not the most objective view of our performance. In fact, coming in as I put myself in the back a bit, I think our pipelines are much improved. One -- and if you recall from our earlier discussions, my first  in this role I described for you a massive restructuring of our R&D teams and how we set up our business units and how we put more of our instrumentation, for example, all under Patrick. And we consolidate from 3 different aspect divisions into one. I think now you\\'re starting to see those -- the impact of those because we now have our monies allocated on the biggest bet, and I think we\\'re able to get to decisions more quickly, and we\\'re able to get to market more quickly. So I believe that our product lines -- I mean, our pipelines are most robust they\\'ve ever been, and I would say to all of you on the call is we\\'re not done yet. So we have a lot of great ideas, very strong team. And I think our -- but our pipeline and portfolio has never been in better shape. Great. And I guess, turning to the gross margins. They\\'re really strong in the quarter. Can you just dig in a little bit more there? Like, what was leading that strength in the business  going forward? Yes, I\\'ll make some high-level comments, and I think -- then I\\'ll pass it on to Didier. So obviously, topline growth at 9% core growth helps a lot. But we also have a number of initiatives underway in order fulfillment team, our global manufacturing footprint under Henrik. And we\\'re getting a lot of cost out of our materials, optimizing overhead costs as well as driving down logistics. But anything else you\\'d add? It\\'s probably a mix impact there, I think, as well. Nothing to add. Obviously, I chose -- 30 years ago, you started as a -- in the controllership organization, Mike. I guess, I got a couple of short ones since a lot of what I\\'ve wanted to know was asked. Can you just break out the instrument versus consumable organic growth for the quarter? Well, I guess, you\\'re probably referring to the analytical side of the house. I think the best way to look at that is just go to the performance of the LSAG and ACG groups. So I believe Patrick was up 6% and -- on a core basis. And Mark and the CrossLab Group was double digit at 10%. Great. Just on the -- you called out this winning this order in Quest for staining. Can you give us an idea sort of the magnitude on how that sort of works in the numbers going forward? Yes, so we were pretty excited by this, as you imagine. It\\'s a pretty significant win. I think it really is a testament to what we believe is a -- it is an excellent product that the Omnis Autostainer was introduced. It\\'s a real validation of how strong that product offering is. But Jacob, perhaps, you want to add a few comments in terms of the deal parameters, at least, perhaps, described for Derik how the rollout looks, the multiyear deal. Yes, Thanks. And as you can imagine, we are quite happy with -- that we won this account. And as you know, Quest is one of the biggest reference laboratories in the U.S., so this is a substantial deal for us. I cannot go into the actual numbers, but we are looking at a multiple site rollout over the next 6 to 9 months, where we will install on this in all of the Quest sites here in the U.S. And we look at many, many on this and many, many hundred thousands of slides test that will be run on those instruments within a year time frame. And sort of a follow-up. I remember when you bought Dako back in 2012, the business was sort of underperforming and sort of lagging peers. Can you sort of talk about where we are sort of with Dako these days? And I guess, how are -- are you sort of going back at the market or the consumable is sort of back where it\\'s going? I mean, is that tracking on where you thought it would be? Yes, I mean, so I\\'ve been part of that journey for quite a while now, and I\\'m very pleased where we are today. Omnis is definitely a driver of that. And then, we played instrument to drive consumables. So what is we -- the key indicator for us internally is how our consumables, our test volume, is increasing. And we can see a very, very strong momentum in the test volume, not only from our PD -L1, but also from our broad portfolio of assays. So I see both strong win over of new accounts and also current accounts driving more and more slides out there. So I will say that we have turned that business around, and there\\'s still a lot we can do. But I feel like we\\'re now working on an market growth level, and there\\'s more and more to do and much more to come. So just if I could touch briefly on just the GCM. A couple of other questions have already been answered, so maybe if I could ask on the -- overall, in the LC/MS business, seems like that continues to grow. Could you maybe give us a sense of -- if you\\'re taking share with Q-TOF? And appreciate the comments in Q-TOF and triple quads there. Are you taking share in that market with Q-TOF versus the high-resolution competitors in the market? Or is it more of the biomolecules growth that you continue to see in that market that\\'s propelling the numbers forward? First of all, thank you very much for the congratulatory comments, and I think I\\'ll pass it over to Patrick and give you -- share some more insights in terms of what\\'s going on with LC/MS. Yes. Thank you, Mike. And you\\'re right, Puneet, it\\'s not only the triple quad market that\\'s strong. When you look at the opportunity in Q-TOF, it\\'s playing in the biomolecule market. As Mike said, we just launched a new bio Q-TOF that drives healthy growth on the biopharma. And with that along -- and along that also, we\\'ve put the Q-TOF itself. We also deploy, as you know, the Q-TOF in applied markets like environmental when you do pesticide screening and environmental fluid, et cetera. We have very differentiated solutions from our side, so I think that we have a great opportunity with this platform. We don\\'t disclose market shares and market share gains. But I would say with what we have launched and also what we\\'re launching at the upcoming ASMS, we are looking very much forward to continue growth in the LC/MS market. Okay. Got that. Just a brief one, if I could, on the expectations for the pharmDx PD-L1 test that you have in place. There are competitors that have been entering that market with our label expansion. So has that changed your opportunity overall in that market? What\\'s your thoughts there? Yes, I can take that also, and you\\'re absolutely right that we see competitors entering to the market. That is not unexpected once you get in a CDx business and when you are departments with a pharma company that you enter and you get a first move advantage, meaning that many accounts have already implemented our test and trained the pathologies in reading out as a slide. So even as a new competitor coming in there, that is, of course, increased competition. But we believe we are in a very strong position to continue with our leadership position. I wanted to follow up on the back of the Intuvo launch. Do you think you\\'re seeing more pull through across selling opportunities across the rest of the portfolio? Maybe any intangible signs at CrossLab or elsewhere? Yes, absolutely. So we\\'ve been calling this the inside to cover the halo effect. So as you may know in this space, gas chromatography is often viewed as a very mature technology. So customers aren\\'t anxious to have a sales rep come out and talk about the gas chromatography. Different story when you\\'re -- you\\'ve got a product like Intuvo, which is it\\'s so different. And customers now recognize that there\\'s really something special here with this offering. So what we\\'re finding is that our account manager was able to go out and get appointments, meet with a customer. And then that allows us to have a broader discussion around the productivity improvements and enhancements on, for example, our 7890 or we can talk about our enterprise services and consumables. You may have noted -- and I\\'ll ask Mark to chime in on this since he\\'s been the -- probably quiet on call so far on the consumables and services side. But what we\\'ve seen is we get into a different conversation with a customer, and that\\'s why you noticed in my earnings call script, I talked a lot about the broad-based growth in chemical and energy. I think this Intuvo GC has been great to help us get into a different set of conversations with customers. And, Mark, I don\\'t know if you\\'d add anything on what you\\'re seeing on the consumables and services side because you had double-digit growth in that space as well. Well, I have just a couple of things, Mike, and we\\'ve talked before about how we\\'ve seen the market over the last couple of years. As customers continued to use their assets, improve the performance of the asset itself, keep their -- obviously, their operations going, and when we see the tailwind, if you will, from now more purchase in the marketplace, it\\'s really more just a surge of new installation that provides some additional revenues in the space. So overall, though, the differentiation in the market, it comes back to some work we\\'re doing and inside of our chemistries division around new technologies associated with the Intuvo, also advancing some of the chemistries we\\'ve done in very traditional space, in GC columns and seeing some nice market gains there. So all in all, it\\'s just -- it\\'s been proved to be a case where customers continue to buy based on keeping it going, but also on top of that, look towards the additional revenues from the expansion in the energy space. Yes. Thanks, Mark. And just to kind of close it off, Jack, which I think what we\\'re able to do is actually go out and talk about the whole portfolio with the customer including some of the new capabilities and marketing that\\'s brought on board as well. That\\'s great. And then I have the follow-up on the margins and DGG. I think it\\'s the best ever on record that we have, at least our model has. Maybe could you just talk about the scalability of the business as you see it now? And was there anything onetime in the quarter? Just you called out the Quest win again. Just any other color. I mentioned earlier, we\\'re -- the management team is in the conference together taking this call, and there\\'s a big smile on Jacob\\'s face that somebody noticed. And he\\'s well on his task to hitting that -- he\\'s driving for 20% this year. Obviously, the strong revenue performance helped a lot in terms of the operating margin. But perhaps, you want to build on that? Yes, you\\'re absolutely right that we -- the topline drives our bottom line also, so the margin really has driven the 24% margin. Operating margin, we have up 900 basis points, is certainly something I\\'m very pleased with. What I want to remind also is that if you look into Q1, we come from a lower margin perspective there. So the 2 quarters, the first half of the year here is really around the 20%, where I believe we have committed to delivering on this business for the full year. So we are still on that track, and that\\'s what we\\'re aiming for. Maybe I\\'ll just add to that. I mentioned it in my call script, but the early part of this year marked a major milestone for us, which was the integration of the former Dako business into the Agilent infrastructure and systems. And I think that is part of your story. I mean, that was always part of the plant, but that\\'s also why we think that some of these improvements all being, let\\'s say, a 24% operating margin every quarter. But that\\'s also why I believe some of these improvements are sustainable because we are fundamentally changing the underlying cost structure that support this business. Mike, again, it doesn\\'t look like we\\'re getting together -- Mike, it doesn\\'t look like we\\'re getting together for Analyst Day this spring, so maybe just one on strategy. Wondering if you can offer anything on how interested you are in M&A at this point. And to the extent that you\\'re looking around at assets, what might you be willing to deploy? And then where might the focus be? Yes, I think, first of all, you correctly noted. We\\'re not holding an Analyst Day this year. It\\'s not to say that we won\\'t do it again, but we felt like the first year was important for the management team to come out and tell the new story. I thought it was important a year later to tell you how it\\'s going. And then a lot of the coaching and obviously  hey, Mike, we really prefer you to have you spend a lot of time just run the business and focus on customers. So that\\'s our plan. But we\\'ll probably back out at some point in time with Analyst Day as we move into \\'18. Relative to M&A, I would just leave it as I think what the communication we\\'ve had for the prior quarters remain the same, which is we like assets that are in parts of the marketplace, which we see inherently growing faster, whether it be the acquisition we made of Seahorse Bioscience. And I hope you notice that we called out cell analysis as a driver for growth in our LSAG business. We acquired most recently Multiplicom, which is in a faster-growing molecular diagnostics space. So we like assets that -- where the end markets are growing faster than, perhaps, the corporate average. We\\'re bringing a new capability to the company, and we love they\\'re accretive short term. And what we realized is that a lot of the deals actually is going to incur, we believe, in the private space. And we have a pretty active funnel. We like the bolt-on acquisitions. We will do every once in a while technology deal, like we did with Lasergen. We see something that\\'s not out there we don\\'t have. But in general, we want companies with existing customers and revenue that will make a nice run to the company\\'s portfolio. Got it. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then, Didier, on the margin outlook. When you guys brought the 22% op margin target in for the year, it\\'s still kind of sell. I think that was a number that you thought you were capable of doing if things went well. So I guess just given the top line momentum and the progress in terms of the operational stuff, is it right to think about that now? I mean, do you see upside of the 21.5% midpoint for the year just given the trajectory? Yes, we had -- I had explained back in November the reasons why we had reduced kind of the guidance from 22% to 21.5%. It was related to 3 factors. But I also pointed out that, internally, we set our performance metric -- internal performance metric be at risk at the same 22% that we had long talked about. So we do feel that there is a -- we have a shot at it and we were willing to basically put our be at risk there. And since then, we have had some good momentum. And -- but we are absolutely -- it\\'s not yet ready to obviously declare the victory there. That was interesting, I think. But reflecting back at our first Analyst Day, we put out 3-year goals of 5% core growth and 22% operating profits. We\\'re at the 5% core growth, and we\\'re hoping to find a way to get to 22%. And as Didier mentioned, that\\'s a standard where we\\'re holding ourselves to inside of the company. I just have a quick one on your free cash flow guidance. It looks like you guys left that unchanged. And given the guidance raise on revenue\\'s quarter, do you think that may go up? Could you talk about why there\\'s really anything not unchanged? And what\\'s going on with the cash flow? Yes, it\\'s a fair question. Obviously, the operating profit is only one of the manufacturers that we look at in the operating cash flow or free cash flow. Similar to, I guess, the answer to the previous question, we do see a path for a higher operating cash flow than what we have guided at, but we\\'re not yet ready to commit to it. This is actually Bill on for Paul. Just one question for you guys. CrossLabs for the past 4 to 8 quarters has been growing high single digit organically. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that is coming from customers looking to outsource or services for new products? And maybe some -- what are some opportunities to maybe continue to grow that? And then are you seeing some gains in market share as well? Yes, so thanks for the question. I\\'m going to make a few initial reminder comments of how we set up the company, and I\\'m going to pass it over to Mark for some specifics. But I\\'ve been going back to this trip down memory lane a bit, if you will. And 2 years ago, when we set up the company, we formed CrossLab Group. It really did change our view of the addressable market for the company. We said not only do we want the Agilent install base, but we should view the whole lab ecosystem as the opportunity for Agilent to provide value to our customers. And we also thought there\\'s some -- starting see some fundamental changes in terms of demand that there\\'ll be some outsourcing from companies such as Big Pharma that were looking for new -- for somebody to take on some of their internal activities. And I think that\\'s happened. It is happening. So Mark, why don\\'t you kind of build on the story and also talk about how we\\'re doing relative to our wins in the market? Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question. I\\'ll try to be as specific as I can. You asked the question about how much of this is based on outsourcing, it\\'s difficult to say. But I think if you look at the trends in pharma and even some of the recent studies down there, there\\'s an increasing work to outsourcing as I go for with the area for optimization. I don\\'t think it\\'s accelerated necessarily, but it\\'s still out there. I would say in our case, we\\'ve had a broad focus on the lab operations side and bringing all our components together as complete solutions. And I think that\\'s what\\'s really driving a lot of our growth, is how we\\'re coming together as more of a partner and consulting on how to get the most out of those lab operations. And competitively, looking at this is at a growing market, are we gaining share? The answer, I think, simply is both. And -- or executing well on the ground in terms of our sales teams across the globe. We\\'re also seeing just our increasing portfolio that goes towards this multivendor area. Hopefully, that helps. That does. And Mike, maybe just one quick one on capital allocation. As you think about share buybacks, dividends and with $1.80 net cash, how do you think about what\\'s the optimal strategy for Agilent in terms of leverage or lack thereof? Well, we think that we\\'ve been describing it as a balanced capital allocation policy, where our primary use of cash is to invest in the business. We talked about M&A a bit already today, but also the investment in our new facility in Colorado. So we\\'re going to use our cash for -- primarily for investing in the business, but we also want to increasingly grow our cash dividends. So you see every year, we\\'ve been bringing up our cash dividend, and we\\'re also using our leverage capability to actually buy back shares. So the share repurchase program that was announced when I came in as CEO actually was financed through debt. So -- and we like to keep some -- our debt capacity available for M&A as we would see, and we\\'re quite conscious of maintaining the investment grade level rating on our debt. So I guess, long -- or short of it is no change from the strategy we\\'ve been pursuing for the last 2 years. Within pharma, you\\'ve talked about small molecule customers going to a replacement cycle, any updated thoughts on how much longer that has left? And then can you break out what you saw from small molecule versus biopharma in the quarter? Yes. So I think, Patrick, your opinions. I won\\'t go into a baseball analogy, but I think we\\'re -- I won\\'t ask you for the innings. But I think we\\'ve always believed we\\'ve had at least another 18 months or so of higher demand. By the way, there\\'s always a replacement cycle going on. We have just been in the accelerated one going on in pharma as it relates to chromatography. We think that we may be seeing the earlier signs of that same thing happening in gas chromatography, but we\\'ll still wait and see on the sidelines for that. Relative to the -- to mix between small and large molecule, I think it\\'s fair to say that the -- both have been growing quite strongly, but the growth in biopharma is at a higher rate than the small molecule, albeit, a smaller part of our mix. Historically, we\\'ve been about 85-15, I guess, between small molecule and large molecule. About 80-20, sorry. Yes, 80-20. And we\\'re putting a lot of investment and focus on the biopharma space. So we talked a lot in my call about some of the new solutions, and it\\'s also been a major area of emphasis in terms of investment in our channel as well. Okay. And then looking at the economic end market. Can you quantify what growth was across the different geographies and remind us of your exposure by geography in that end market? So while Didier is looking for his notes, I\\'ll just say this is the one part of the end market where the pitcher has continued to be quite challenged. The funding level share globally, with perhaps the exception of China, have been fairly weak. But why don\\'t you provide some of the breakout? No, I\\'ll just say it was throughout the world, we saw year-over-year kind of a reduction with the exception mostly of us -- Japan but on the small base, and that surprised us. And there is not much we can wriggle of that because it\\'s on the small base, and parts of -- other parts of Asia Pacific. But the big markets, Americas and Europe, were weak. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the floor back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. All right. Thank you, Karen. And on behalf of the management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call on Investor Relations, and thanks again.

Q3 marked another strong quarter for the Agilent team. We exceeded our own expectations on both the top and bottom line. We continue to deliver above-market growth. Our revenues of $1.11 billion grew by 7.5% on a core basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.59 is up 20% over last year’s third quarter. Our focus on operational excellence continues to pay-off. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 21.5%, up 90 basis points from a year ago.  I can remember when I became Agilent’s CEO, you asked me a very good question, could Agilent make the adjustments to improve our operating margin while outgrowing the market? Well, we have. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of improving core operating margins while outgrowing the market. So where is our strong Q3 growth coming from? From an end-market perspective, both the global Chemical & Energy and Pharma markets grew by 10%. And geographically, China continues to be strong, while we experienced better than expected growth in Europe. Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening in our end-markets. Our Pharma revenue is up 10%. We are well-positioned to capture growing customer demand with our broad and differentiated offerings of instruments, services and consumables. Demand was also strong for our API offerings. Chemical & Energy is up 10%. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Similar to last quarter, growth was broad-based across regions and products. Our customers are beginning to upgrade their labs and are investing in equipment replacements. While some uncertainty remains on the pace of recovery, we are encouraged by the reinvestment.  After four consecutive quarters of decline, we had a nice surprise with the low-single digit core growth in Academia and Government. Strength in Europe and double-digit growth in cell analysis, spectroscopy and services drove our results. Food grew 2% against a difficult compare in Q3 last year. Food market fundamentals remain sound with strength this quarter in Europe. Environmental and Forensics grew a healthy 7%. Our strong growth was driven by Asia Pacific and the Americas. Concerns about the health of our environment continue to drive the Asia market. Diagnostics and Clinical grew by 6%, led by pathology and companion diagnostics and geographically, strength in Europe. Now turning to look at our different regions. Geographic performance was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and continued China performance. The Americas grew by mid-single digits, while Japan was flat. And now let’s turn to the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 7%. From an end-market perspective, strength in Chemical & Energy, Pharma and Environmental continue to drive the performance. Looking at our product portfolio, growth is broad across all our products. And we continue to strengthen our line-up. We recently introduced several new additions to our InfinityLab LC series. At ASMS, we unveiled our newest LC-MS triple quad, the Ultivo. It is not an exaggeration to say it’s revolutionary. The Ultivo is 70% smaller than previous instruments, yet it still delivers the same or better performance than its predecessor. Our customers tell us that the triple quad is the workhorse of the lab. The Ultivo allows our customers to maximize their lab space and increase capacity without compromising performance or uptime. This revolutionary new instrument is a great example of Agilent’s market expertise and commitment to customer-centric innovation. We also strengthened our GC-MS line up with the introduction of a new high-resolution, accurate-mass system. This new product will help our customers address the growing demand for identification of unknown chemical samples. We look to buy businesses in fast growing, adjacent market segments with differentiated offerings and strong teams. In July, we completed the acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems, adding Raman spectroscopy to our spectroscopy line-up. Cobalt Light Systems has developed ground breaking technology that is integrated into an innovative suite of benchtop and handheld instruments. We are now directly participating in this fast-growing spectroscopy market segment. There are strong synergies between the two companies. We are scaling the operations of Cobalt Light Systems and will be offering our current customers these ground-breaking solutions. CrossLab, a key strategic move of the New Agilent, continues to pay-off. The Agilent CrossLab Group maintained its strong performance again this quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Growth was robust for both services and consumables. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Results were driven by strong demand for our pathology products and companion diagnostics services. We see particular strength for our PD-L1 and molecular products. As I mentioned earlier, our Nucleic Acid Solutions business, which can be lumpy, performed well and is up by very strong double digits. The growth we saw in our Pathology business is a strong sign that we are regaining market share with our automation system, OMNIS, and the new products we are continuing to introduce. From special stains to new ready-to-use antibody offerings, our Pathology Division is creating a lot of momentum. We also introduced our newest next-generation sequencing library prep solution, Agilent SureSelectXT HS. This research solution benefits our customers by streamlining the entire NGS workflow. On the M&A front, we acquired the molecular and sample barcoding patent portfolios of Population Genetics Technologies. This expansion of our IP portfolio bolsters our target enrichment leadership position enabling the future introduction of new solutions to our customers. Rapid integration of the Multiplicom business continues to proceed according to plan.  Let me close out my portion of the call, recapping the journey of the New Agilent and with some comments on our Q4 outlook. In May of 2015, at our first analyst and investor day of the New Agilent, we laid out an ambitious three-year plan to create shareholder value. We made three commitments. We committed to outgrow the market. We committed to improve adjusted operating margins over 400 basis points. We committed to take a balanced approach to deploying our capital. Over the past 10 quarters we have been delivering on our commitments. I am so proud of this team. We are on the cusp of achieving the goals that we set for ourselves that we first shared with you over two years ago. We are a team that delivers on its commitments. I think it is now time to retire the description New Agilent. We have put in a new foundation for the company to grow and we are firmly focused on the future. The achievement of these goals is just the beginning. Our story is a forward-looking story with a laser focus on delivering superior earnings growth and creating shareholder value. Looking at the more immediate future, I want to close with a few comments about Q4 ’17. First, we remain somewhat cautious about the potential for a cyclical recovery. We also know we are heading into a period of tough compares for our global Pharma and China businesses. Yet, the overall market environment for Agilent is stronger than forecasted coming into this year. Given these considerations, we are once again raising our full-year core growth and earnings expectations. I look forward to answering your questions later in the call. I will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q3 results and updated guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, both on a year-over-year basis and versus our guidance. Currency had a positive impact on revenue and operating profit of respectively $7 million and $1 million versus previous guidance. Please also note that we have reduced our pro-forma tax rate by 1 percentage point, which had a $0.02 impact on our Q3 EPS.  I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion and EPS of $0.60 to $0.62. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 3.5% on a core basis. As a reminder, our core revenue growth last Q4 was a strong 6.3%, so Q4 is a tough compare, coming after an easier Q3 compare. Versus previous guidance, currency is estimated to have a positive impact of $24 million on revenue and $4 million on operating profit. Finally, our 22.4% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 90 basis points sequentially. Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. The Q4 guidance is expected to result in the following fiscal year guidance. First at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 6.0% on a core basis, or 1 percentage point over the previous guidance. The revenue guidance of $4.445 billion is $75 million over previous guidance including $31 million due to currency and $1 million due to M&A. Second, our EPS guidance of $2.30 at midpoint is up $0.12 from previous guidance and corresponds to a 16% year-over-year increase. Currency contributed $0.01 and the reduction in pro-forma tax rate contributed $0.03. Third, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 21.8% or 110 basis points higher than in FY16. And last but not least, we have raised our operating cash flow guidance from $825 million to $850 million and we are reducing our CapEx guidance from $200 million to $185 million, this leads to an increase in free cash flow guidance of $40 million. Didier, in the DGG business, a bit of quarterly variation of the op margin line. Where do you think the op margin settle in if we just look out a bit maybe past the current year, is there a range you kind of help us with there? Yeah, you\\'re right. The DGG business can be a little lumpy on an operating margin basis for many, many reasons. What\\'s important is that we came from you know we were coming from 13% operating margin in 2015 to 16% in 2016. And we are aiming still as we have basically announced back two years ago to close to 20% in 2017. So the range I would say after we complete this fiscal year will be around 20% that we\\'ve talked about. And Jacob, I don’t know if you want to add anything? And then Mike maybe just on chemical and energy, could you just put a little color to what you\\'re seeing inside that business. Obviously the unit is always doing better. Just curious what the commentary on exploration sounds like at this point. Are you expecting to finish the year sort of on a similar note or might we see some pick up towards the fourth quarter. Sure Dan. Maybe first of all I want to reground some of the segments because I think probably last five or six maybe seven quarters I would describe a certain breakdown of the chemical and energy along the lines of energy refining and chemical. And as you know we\\'ve been under - the energy sector has been under a lot of pressure last two quarters. So right now our estimates are that energy represents about 10% of the - excuse me, thank you Patrick, exploration I got mixed up here, exploration represents about 10% of the total, where refining is about 30% and the chemical side is about 60%. So just to kind of ground yourself there\\'s less of our business now in the exploration side of the business. We actually expect that to continue to be down for the remainder of this year. So we\\'re not really seeing much going on there. What we are seeing is what I pointed into in my script is that there\\'s been a high emphasis on cash management and cash control in prior years. We’re starting to see a little bit of money being freed up to focus on reinvestments and really to drive productivity and back to the small recent article in Wall Street Journal talking about the importance on customers, companies driving towards increased earnings. So what that tells us is that energy - the exploration side of the segment is going to continue to be down. We expect replacement to continue in the chemical side. We are still cautious on the refining side of the business. In fact you may have recently seen that the next 12 months EPS forecast for large cap and refining companies have declined since May. So it\\'s not all going well in the segment, but overall we\\'re encouraged by the results. So only two quarters of strong growth, so we\\'re not yet ready to call a cyclical turnaround. But I would remind you that for the year we\\'re forecasting overall 8% growth for this chemical energy segment, a much different result than you’ve seen in the prior two years. So hopefully that helps get at your question. What\\'s your general sense for how much of the strength you saw this quarter was overall end market strength versus strength of some of the new products that you\\'ve launched? Hey Tim, thanks for the question. So as you know our whole model is built around outgrowing the market based on a real focus on innovation that matters to customers tied to really a solid go to market channel. So I think what you\\'ve got going on is sort of a perfect storm if you will from a standpoint of, we\\'re able to put up these very strong growth results because we have a highly competitive and differentiated portfolio. So we know we\\'re gaining market share in a growing market and that really leads to the kind of results that we\\'re having here. So I know all CEOs claim to be gaining market share, but we look at the numbers that seem to prove out for us. And then could you maybe just comment on the runway for CrossLab, is that something where you still feel like there is multiple years of above market growth? So I’ll make some initial opening comments here Tim and then I\\'ll invite Mark to take a bow in terms of the results we’ve been pushing up here and talk about the future. So as I commented in my script this was a major strategic initiative for us to really go after this, what we see to be a new market for us in CrossLab, so I think much broader about our offering in the lab and really to focus on enterprise services and we think about the entire lab as our opportunity. We\\'ve had a number of quarters of very strong growth and our view is that we can expect to see this growth continue. And I point out to you some of their markets which historically haven\\'t been big purchase of service for example, are really driving a lot of growth for example, we had stellar results once again in China. So Mark, why don’t you give your thoughts about the future of the CrossLab group and can you sustain this run here on. Oh thanks Mike and hi Tim. Let me elaborate a little bit on Mike\\'s comment and a lot of attention comes around our enterprise solutions business. And that is a big factor behind our growth. However, want to peel that back a little bit. The instrument service business is much larger been growing in high single digits that’s enabling workflows and certainly complimentaring a lot of the new product technologies we’re bringing to market and the consumables business is routinely growing in the mid to high single digit range too. If I look ahead though we see a very robust market for the enterprise business in particular in pharma and increasingly inside the commercial labs and serve across multiple end markets, they can be environmental, food et cetera. And so, I don\\'t think there is any end in sight when it comes to the challenge of improving the productivity of the lab operations and that\\'s really where our value proposition is build upon versus single sourcing can we truly help you get the efficiency of the lab going out. So very bullish about our runway in this business going forward and I’d say it’s more than just enterprise service story, it\\'s really about our instrument service business and our consumables rounding out the entire picture. Mike, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the performance in biopharma in this quarter, specifically the trends you\\'re seeing at US pharma and then maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the commentary related API and the offering there. Sorry about that Jack, they say your hearing is one of the first things to go when you get older. Let me start with the biopharma comment and then Patrick I’m going to have you jump in and give your view on the dimensions by geography. But, we’re really pleased although we don\\'t report externally the absolute results in the biopharma segment of the pharma market. We\\'re really pleased with how this business is performing. As you may recall this is a major strategic initiative that we launched probably about two and a half years ago to really go after the biopharma market segment in a much different manner. We\\'ve been bringing to market a number of new novel solutions. We\\'ve changed our go-to market strategy and it\\'s paying off. So what I can tell you is we grew double digits in biopharma in the third quarter. We think we’re outpacing the overall market and perhaps you have a view of mix by geography and then anything else you want to add Patrick. Yeah, sure thanks Mike. So we have seen a very, very strong growth in China. We have seen reasonable growth in EMEA and Europe, and also a single-digit growth in AFO. So that\\'s the distributional regional level. And it\\'s heavily driven of course by biopharma as Mike mentioned because that is growing ahead of the global pharma space, but I would say if you look at the difference segments in pharma, it\\'s on the R&D side as well as manufacturing  very well represented there. And we don\\'t see a real slowdown right now in the biopharma space. So looking forward given the new portfolio we have, also the focus on complete workflows that we launched over the last couple of months, we\\'re pretty confident that we will continue to grow strong in this market and capture more share. So on the API side, our nuclear acid solution division, we see a lot of great momentum in the business and we continue to really be in situation where capacity is our main constraint. So that\\'s also why we right now as we\\'ve explained before we are building this new manufacturing capacity out in Colorado and Boulder, to really make sure we can expand versus the demand that’s out there. We have seen - as a goes in this business, we did see a few quarters ago that one of our customers did not meet the end point in a phase 3 clinical trial and that has led us to rebuild the pipeline. We have seen very strong demand and we’re really back in full swing again.  And then clearly you know a lot of new product launches coming on the mass spec side. I was wondering if you have any thoughts related to pushing mass spec into the clinical setting, a couple of your peers are pretty active there. I was wondering if that was a future target for Agilent as well. So I\\'ll take that Mike thank you. So, as you know we\\'re currently present in the LTG space, we launched class one product several years ago and this is what we see as the sweet spot right now for LCMS and clinical, it\\'s really all about pain management, vitamin D testing and all that application, immunosuppressants. And we are pretty well represented in that space right now, whether it will be able to replace immuno assays as some of our competitors might think, we have some question marks there, we think we are pretty strong in the LTG markets that might continue, we see actually probably more promise on the more sophisticated assays that are related to metabolomics and that are more later spaced of cancer diagnostics and more complex diseases like Alzheimer\\'s a couple of years out. So this is where we see the focus for this business because getting into in a clinical workflow where the light based assay are established and trying to replace those, will be quite difficult I would say. My question on maybe just the longer term outlook on margins, wondering if you can comment a little bit as we think about the framework for next year. Could you get a similar level of margin improvement in other levers, whether it\\'s pricing or improving R&D efficiency that you can kind of point to as we think about the margin set up for next year. Thanks Tycho, I appreciate the question. And what I\\'ll do is I\\'ll refer you back to the messaging that we provided in our last AID. So what we committed to was greater than 22 as we move forward. And we think we\\'ve got a model which allows us to continue to improve our operating margin and it\\'s going to a combination of a number of things you mentioned already, which is the innovation focus, making sure that we\\'re pricing for value, we’re managing on discounts correctly. So we have an initiative underway, we call the PDQ a pricing and discounting quote initiative to really make sure that we\\'re managing the price envelope correctly. I other thing I would point to is also the great work that our order fulfillment team has been doing. So when we form the new company we centralized all the manufacturing logistics, a material procurement in one organization and they\\'ve been doing a very nice job. And we think that the transformation is underway in our supply chain, it currently allows us to have some cost reductions in the future. So won’t commit today in the call to a specific number, but we like improving operating margins without sacrificing growth that was my one of the key parts of my script which says, hey we\\'re going to outgrow the market while improving operating margin. So that will continue be our model. And as we look forward and you can expect us to try to sustain levels of success we\\'ve enjoyed so far. And then question on Intuvo, I understand you\\'re generally not calling for a cyclical chemical and energy recovery, but if we think about just the sales cycle, can you maybe talk as to how it\\'s tracked versus initial expectations. How long . Glad to, we\\'re always happy to talk about Intuvo and we also have the Ultivo. So it is getting a little - can be a tongue twister at times, but Patrick why don’t you update the colors on what\\'s going on with Intuvo. Yeah absolutely, where we\\'re very happy with the feedback we receive from the installed base after instruments we have shipped so far. Customers are really excited about the performance, robustness and ease of use of this product. That said, we\\'re not yet shipping it in really big bulk orders. As we said in the calls, last quarter and the quarter before is we think that will happen more in fiscal year ’18 when customers had enough time to test the instruments and also assign budgets to these instruments moving forward. I think that was a learning for us Patrick, which is we thought we had - we were in sort of a window with a. September launch, but we really - what we found out from our customers that we really didn\\'t have time to plan for this in their 2017 budget. Absolutely, actually, we launched September last year and the feedback we got from several - lots and lots of accounts was well very nice instrument, we didn\\'t have the time to really plan for the budget for fiscal year ’17, but we are now getting feedback from those that are certainly in the budget for fiscal year ’18. Again, the feedback is very positive. It’s still early in the ramped volume of this product but we are really excited about the excitement it drives also across the other products we have out there. We\\'re clearly seen as the market leader on gas chromatography and go to company. And then just one last one on academic, looks like Europe is being the driver there. Any comments on the US market, are budgets freeing up a little bit here from what you’re seeing? Tycho, when we looked at some of the numbers and talked about as a team, we said listen, what we really seen is, our growth, which is a nice surprise for us in the third quarter really was our market share gain story. So we\\'re still not seeing a lot of active funding going on in the marketplace. And I think US still seems to be fairly subdued and Patrick I don\\'t know what your thoughts on that, but I think we\\'re not that bullish on the overall market environment. We do think we\\'re able to pick up some growth here given that we\\'ve historically been under represented in terms of share, but the market is still not very robust. Agreed yes, definitely the US is not very robust. We have seen some upticks in Europe in the last quarter which helped to drive growth. And we think we are very well positioned with our portfolio. We also have a dedicated program within the company to really look at our coverage model for academia and government. And as Mike said, it\\'s all about taking market share from other competitors and this is what we are after. I think that\\'s maybe something that I should have mentioned earlier Tycho, as part of our channel strategy changes we made when I came in as CEO, we really cater a dedicated focus on academia and government. So I think perhaps they’re starting to see some payoff for those early investments now. Can you talk about some of your initiatives that are on developing like your oligo expansion? And also my follow up would be your thoughts on, is Asia getting better or is the same specifically China? And relative to the oligo expansion, in fact a few of us are heading out there tomorrow to see firsthand, we\\'ve seen pictures of the building, but there is nothing like seeing it firsthand. So we have going out and spent some time with the team, we’re expanding in Frederick, the construction schedule is going right according to plan. I think, Jacob, we’re looking, probably looking like more still FY ’19 revenue. 2018, the factory will be done, but there will be a validation process required. And the reason why I asked Jacob to talk about some of the customer activities because we still see a credible amount of demand for customers and it\\'s been more of a capacity constrained kind of growth challenge for us. But we\\'re fully committed, we\\'ll see firsthand and I’ll have some more in-depth comments when I talk to you next, but the construction schedule and the go-to market is still per plan. And then relative to China, and overall Asia, so I think about China, China continues to develop just as we have forecasted. I think we\\'re a little bit over double digit through the first three quarters, we thought it would to be a double-digit grower for us in 2017, seen no signs of slowdown there. I think what has been a nice surprise is the other countries in Southeast Asia that\\'s been a very fresher growing market for us. You may recall about a year or so ago, lot of concerns about the impact of the currency side of those countries. And inside Agilent, we call it SAPK which is South Asia Pacific and Korea and we\\'ve been putting good growth up in that part of the sector much higher than we had in prior years. I would say that Japan is the one where the market is still sluggish. Although we’ve been able to have about a 6% growth rate over the last two quarters. So that\\'s probably the most challenge of all the Asian markets we play in. I don\\'t know whether you count India in Asia or not, it\\'s managed in Agilent by our European team, but India market also continues to be quite strong. So I think Asia is going to continue to be a growth story, not only for 2017 but into ’18 as well. What\\'s your primary most important element do you think behind your market share gains, is it CrossLab or the tuck-in potential situations like Cobalt? I think it\\'s really, if I’d step back from it, I think it\\'s both a combination of how we’ve been able to broaden our portfolio tied with a true customer focus. And I know you hear it all the time, but we really try to think about what matters to our customers and then aligned our business strategies behind us. So we\\'re only doing great science and driving innovation with some of the new instrumentation that we\\'ve been inducing. But as we mentioned earlier, we’re really helping our customers with what we call the economics of the lab and that\\'s really the CrossLab. So I think we\\'re getting share in both places. And I think it\\'s been that combination of how we architected our, you know, so architect if you will our portfolio strategies. And I can also over emphasize enough the importance of having the right go to customer sales model. And we’ve made some pretty big changes the first year of the new Agilent. And we\\'re now I think starting to see the benefits of that, which is to have a really tight set of customer relationships tied with a broadening portfolio with a much clearer economic value proposition via CrossLab. Just on Dako if I could ask, with the Omnis rollout happening here and you mentioned Quest contract earlier, was that a contribution in the quarter and how should we think about this pull through from these boxes in the back half of the year once they start getting out there. And I know Jacob would love to talk about the overall pathology results for the quarter and then maybe go in specifically to the question around the impact of Quest and timing it may have on our business. Yeah, thanks for that and we are very pleased with where we are with our Dako Omnis business today, where we really see a very strong momentum, a continuous momentum with the business. Clearly we were very pleased with the win of Quest being the primary vendor here, which we announced I think it was last time, we are still in the progress of installing our solutions on several Quest sites. So we haven\\'t seen any contribution from Quest in this quarter and we’ll start to see it coming in the next quarter. But it\\'s primarily a fiscal ’18 view - situation that we would start to see Quest coming in. So right now, our pathology business is really driven by everything else we\\'re doing out there and Quest is just a part of the story. It\\'s a great part of the story but we just do see strengthening in all parts of geographies right now. And then second one on just the pharma growth, obviously strong in the quarter. So if you look at the pharma CRO and the CDMO accounts, what\\'s your sense of sustainability here? What\\'s driving it, is the bio molecules, I mean I suppose they\\'re using a number of products through the LSAG segment. What gives you the sense that these customers are continuing to see growth in bio molecules here. As we’ve heard from few other competitors, there was lumpiness in that segment. I know that some of our competitors reported that, but that\\'s not what we experienced and Patrick you want to... I agree, but this is not what we\\'re seeing right now. And part of it is again the solutions we brought out, the new solutions that helped drive the business there that really focused on the biopharma space. The molecular antibodies, there is a new software solutions out there for biosimiliars like our . I think we’re addressing the needs of his market space better and better. And this will drive for us more pieces moving forward. Especially I think the biosimilars is a market space that will continue to grow. I don\\'t expect a big slowdown in that area. And just last, quickly on China, are you still seeing benefit from the CFDA changes or this contribution, I mean obviously you have tougher comps coming up and you\\'re base is significantly larger in China. So what\\'s your sense of CFDA changes continuing to benefit versus the food environmental business. Yeah, thanks for that question. So we expect the food market to continue to be strong in China, explicitly called that out, I think we used the word food market fundamentals remain strong, growth rates actually a little bit lower for China in Q3 just because we’re coming off a 20% some compare from a prior year. But the money is there, the emphasis is there, it\\'s a critical government policy to continue to improve the safety of their food supply. A lot of work still to be done, so we\\'re expecting growth to still be there. Just want to dive into a little bit detail on what you\\'re seeing from one specific customer base within pharma. So it seems like the generic industry is getting weaker and the challenges are worsening there, at least for some of the public companies. Are you seeing any of that in your customer base yet or any of that in the purchasing patterns? No, I mean it\\'s definitely not growing at the same pace as biopharma did as you outlined here, but it\\'s still growing for us and we don\\'t see any material changes in the next couple of quarters. Yes, we will see tough compares because we have been growing so strong over the last six quarters or seven quarters in pharma, but the fundamental business in small molecule is also there. But if you can show a return on investment, so and I think that’s been one of the selling propositions for the new portfolio? When they\\'re under pressure, generic guys, they\\'re willing to invest because they can see it help serve their earnings profile. Yeah. The whole messaging is around productivity and efficiency gains and cost of ownership for the solutions and that resonates very well with this customer base. I’ll just add on. This is Mark. Obviously with the enterprise solutions business, I’d echo the same comments that Patrick and Mike have, we’ve the value proposition around the economics of the lab continue to resonate as they have more challenges. And then for my follow up, as I think about the 3.5% core growth rate for the fourth quarter, that would be the lightest core growth and I think it\\'s four or five quarters and how much of that would you attribute to a tough comp versus maybe some caution on the end markets versus just some plain old conservatism? So, let me add some color, then, you can add your comment as well, Didier. So when we look at the comps, they\\'re real. I haven\\'t done the math in terms of the X percentage, but pharma is our largest market. It grew 16% Q4 last year. China, which is our second largest geography, grew 27%. So the comp -- the tough compares are real and that\\'s been part of our guiding philosophy all this year, we\\'ve been calling that. Business remains robust, but we know we\\'re going into a period of tough compares. I would say relative to the chemical energy, what we\\'re saying here is business is going to be better than we initially thought it was going to be coming in this year.  We\\'re glad to see the strong growth last two quarters, but there are still some signs that say, let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves here. We\\'ve had -- 40% of the segment is still under pressure. The company\\'s earnings forecasts are projected to be down, so we just think that it\\'s right thing to be doing to not call for a cyclical turnaround just as yet. Maybe just that Europe, we\\'ve had double digit growth two quarters in a row and we also want to be a little bit cautious about extrapolating that number. If last quarter we had told you where we are focusing Europe to go 12% in Q3, I think, you would have crucified us and so it’s tough to adjust. We don’t want to extrapolate those kind of superb results for two quarters. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that initial feedback on an uptick of Ultivo Triple Quad and then just comment on your performance in LC/MS in general? Yeah. Catherine, I’d be happy to. Great question and when your question came through, there was a smile on Patrick’s face. I know he\\'s anxious to share a little more about what\\'s going on with Ultivo. Absolutely. So first, let me handle the Ultivo question and then return all of you on LC/MS and GC/MS as well. We think Ultivo was really to start is here at ASMS. When we introduce the product, it creates a lot of excitement among our customer base. They cannot wait to get the hands on the prototypes. That said, we will launch it anything before end of this quarter. So I don’t expect any revenue contribution in Q4 coming from Ultivo product itself. I think we’re very well positioned to run that product in fiscal year ’18 and capture the market opportunity, specifically in environmental and food application space, where this product is really front and center in terms of the specifications and the application domain.  So lots of excitement around there, but that’s not the only product we have launched at ASMS. We launched a new Infinity Single Quad solution. We have biopharma solution and we launched a new GC solution that will all again drive the momentum behind mass spectrum and solutions. There is strong selling and we’re very optimistic about the future of this product line, the technologies and the focus we have on customer applications, as it creates a lot of excitement and we see that also in the growth rates, all of that in Q3. And then I wanted to spend a little time on the Cobalt acquisition. Can you just walk us through your thought process there, revenue run rate and then what kind of growth you think you could get out of that business? Sure, Catherine. So as I mentioned in the call, we’ve really been trying to find companies which in adjacent markets, which fill gaps in our current offering, but also have a differentiate offering and a very strong team and we\\'ve been trying to build out our spectroscopy business with a lot of success over the last several years, one hope was Raman Spectroscopy, which is arguably one of the fastest growing segments in spectroscopy. So we engaged the Cobalt Light Systems team early. In fact, just had a chance to spend some time with the leadership team here early today and I don’t think they’re yet ready to move to the next phase, but we got to them early, talking about joining the company, being part of Agilent and they really saw advantages to scale in the innovation focus that Agilent has. It’s a 50% plus company, about 10 million plus run rate and we think that, I think double digit growth, Patrick. I’ve got two for Jacob. One is a follow up on the SureSelect commentary. I wonder, as the discussion around that product portfolio has become bigger from Agilent over the last couple of years, if you could give us a little bit more granularity. Can you give us a sense for maybe how big that business is, how fast it\\'s growing, are you taking share, is it accelerating, can you talk about how the portfolio, including SureSelect and around SureSelect in library prep, sample prep, is contributing to the growth in DGG. Yes. So Steve thanks for that. And I’m very pleased with the new announcement of the SureSelectXT HS, which I think is going to really drive the business going forward. First of all, it will work very well with FFPE and with the molecular barcodes, you will also see that we will be able to really get very certain results on low, little frequencies. So I think this is exactly what the market is looking for. Overall, the SureSelect and our target enrichment business has been a success story for DGG and for genomics over last many years. It is a substantial part of the genomics business and it continues to grow in the double digit regime. I think we\\'ve seen the industry over the last few quarters that the market has at least taken a little bit of a pause, but we still show double digit growth of our business.  So it is -- I think we still are definitely keeping our market share out in the business. I\\'m not sure right now whether we’re taking market share, but we’re certainly keeping it and with the new SureSelectXT HS, I\\'m very convinced that we will start to see even stronger momentum again. I will say that SureSelect and where we’re going with all of this right now is our strategy is to become a whole workflow provider, where SureSelect is going to be a key part of that and SureSelect’s entry into that market. So clearly, it’s very important for us going forward, but we\\'re going to expand out both with the platform, our bioinformatics platform, but also with our Lasergen investments, we hope to be a full workflow provider in the future. The second thing I was hoping to just get a little color on is the new asset solutions market, the environment surrounding the investment in Colorado. On the last call, Mike gave us an update on the progress there. We talked about the potential for that to be a more material contributor to capacity expansion for fiscal ’19. Could you give us a sense for how big you think the relative opportunity is compared to how much business you\\'re doing there today and how much business are you just having to pass on because of that capacity constraint and how fast does it ramp? Yeah. Thanks, again, Steve and appreciate the interest in the  business, which is very exciting. Most of our costumers today are still doing clinical trials. So there\\'s a lot of investment and we continue to track the investment going into this market right now with this new type of drugs and there is a continued increased investments and we\\'re hopeful to see some of those clinical trials coming out into commercial products over the next few years here and that will create a substantial step up in the -- both in the expectations and also the requirements to our capacity. So I see that this could take it quite far over the next ten years, I would say, pharma does not go as fast as diagnostic, but you will see some step-ups every time we see some products going out and be commercial. So related to our current business, I think there is certainly an opportunity to substantially -- see a substantial growth going forward over the next five years and probably also next ten years. Yeah. I\\'ll just add one thing Steve. Right now, the business is about $70 million, $80 million and we are capped, we are operating at maximum capacity. And as Mike and Jacob mentioned, the new capacity only comes on board in 2019 and will add about $100 million after its full running state. So the ramp will be throughout fiscal year ’19, so fiscal year ’20, we’re talking about $100 million just with that additional business, but 2018 will be relatively flat with 2017, because we’re already at capacity of existing facilities. Mike, just a question on the M&A. At a high level, how you see the pipeline and if you could sort of elaborate on exactly what the Population Genetics deal does for you strategically and economically? Sure, Brandon. Happy to address both questions. Relative to M&A, we still see that there\\'s a pretty robust pipeline of targets out there, but not in the historic places where people are focused on in the US public sector. There\\'s a lot of very, very strong companies in Europe in the private sector as well as in the US and you may recall that in May, we had a new Head of Strategy and Business Development join Agilent and one of the priorities there is related to continue to find ways to make M&A more of a growth platform within the overall operating model we have to continue to describe for us in terms of how we want to use our cash and our balance sheet strength, I would say valuations are a little rich, so you have to be -- make sure you don\\'t get too far ahead of yourself in terms of what you’re willing to pay, but I think that there are viable targets out there, particularly for a company of Agilent’s size where we can acquire companies and really can make a meaningful impact ultimately in terms of our ability to grow.  The recent IP that we purchased, why don’t you talk a little bit about the strategic thought process, Jacob and the financials around it? Yeah. Absolutely. And the Population Genetics, PopGen is as Mike was mentioning an IP consideration and we’re very pleased to have that, which creates a very strong IP situation within molecular barcodes, where we see a very strong interest for molecular barcode is, I think, this is going to be very important is, first of all, most in liquid biopsies, but secondly also for what we call eliminating false positives that you see in NGS right now and especially going into DX, the diagnostic markets where you need to make sure that what you made sure is actually fully related to or correlated to actually the sample you’re having there and using those molecular barcodes ensures that you are very certain of what you measure is actually also there. So I believe actually that molecular barcodes is going to be required to really have a play in the diagnostic setting going forward and so I think we will be in a very strong position to really drive that market. One more for Didier, in terms of the CapEx outlook, the $15 million reduction, was that a pushout into ’19 and or excuse me ’18 and as far as next year goes, should we still expect a return to normal level of CapEx, call it, around 110 million, 120 million for next year? Yeah. It is indeed a pushout into ’18, but you will see ’18 will be lower than the number that we’ve just quoted for ’17. So we are returning to a more normal stage in ’18, but mostly it will be in ’19. I want to touch on two topics. The first is tax. You reduced your full year tax rate guidance, you\\'re on track to get to an 18% non-GAAP tax rate level well ahead of your prior expectations. Should we expect further tax rate reductions towards your, something like your much lower cash tax rate moving forward and if you could quantify anything there would be helpful. The second topic is on end markets and guidance. I was hoping that you\\'d be willing to share your assumptions for growth by end market and geography at least as they\\'re embedded into your Q4 revenue growth guidance. Thank you. Sure. Yes. Doug, yeah, you rightly pointed out that our new pro forma tax rate of 18% is way above our cash tax rate, which is less than 10%. So we do see opportunities, but it’s hard work. I’m not ready to commit now to like a, did not commit to a precise operating margin expansion number. I’m not ready to commit yet to a precise path, but yes, there is more opportunities and we’re working hard to identify ways to reduce our reserves, so that we can move closer to, I mean, move our pro forma tax rate down and it’s -- stay posted. Let me take the next one. Yeah. So I think if you look at our full year guidance, Doug, 6% core growth for the overall enterprise, we expect China to be right around 10% or so for the year. Overall, Asia around double digit with mid-single digit growth in Europe as well as Americas. So again, the Asia side of the business is expected to be the growth engine, as other geographies are expected to grow for us this year. And then when I look at, like if I find my notes relative to the, maybe you can help me. Thanks, Alicia. So when we look at the end market, again, the same 6% core growth.  Here, what we are seeing is I think about 7% to 8% range is I think what we’ve been talking about, about 8% for the year. As I mentioned, there are some caveats, still, there are some segments which still have some question marks. We’ve been very consistent with our view that pharma would go from its double digit grower that we had in ’16 to more high single digit. So you probably look in 8-ish pro forma for the full year, flat for academia and government and then high single digits for diagnostics and clinical and then food, environmental and forensics, low single digits. So the story here is – Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. All right. So Doug just took my question, so now I got to be creative. Thanks, Doug. So can we talk a little bit about pacing during the quarter? I mean, you do have an extra month relative to some of your peers on this, was July any different than May or June? I mean, any signs of potential unusual seasonality showing in the quarter? I think Derik, we don’t explicitly talk about our incoming orders in terms of where we finish, but what I can tell you is Q3 was like any other Q3 we’ve seen, so nothing really special about it besides the fact that it was an excellent quarter for the company. Okay. And when you look at your pharma business, I mean we\\'ve had a lot of questions about generic exposure and how much of your business is actually tied to the generics manufacturers in the overall pharma segment? Hey, I’m not as dumb as I look. So you did 6% core growth in ’15, 6% in ’16, you’re tracking to 6% this year, given a conservative Q4 guide. When we sort of look at the business and just looking where the segments are, I mean are there, is the mid-single digit sort of core growth rate on the business for next year is certainly a reasonable number to sort of think about as we start thinking about expectations. So, I’m going to kind of do a little kind of teaser for our November call. So I’ll hold the guide for November call. Didier is giving me hand signals on that one right now, but I think what you can see a consistent message is our ability, our model is all about outgrowing the market. So I think that’s what you can look for us to do and like I said earlier, we really, we return , foundation and the model that’s gotten us here, we’re going to stay with that model. But if you could just wait a few more months, I’ll have much more clear answer to your question. Wanted to come back to the industrial portion of the business and I think you covered some of the backdrop on energy, but interested in what went on in chemical this quarter, just talk a little bit about not just the growth rate, but also kind of your outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, obviously the commodity dynamic here may hold volatile, so interested in the chemical side of your business and how you’re managing through that. So just a reminder, we\\'re now going to be talking about a different ratio of the three segments that make up the generics space, given the climate we’ve over last two years in exploration side, so exploration is about 10%, it is about 30%. So if you will, the energy sector about 40%. The other 60% is what we call chemicals and materials. And that’s really been where, what the growth we’re seeing has been coming from. Some reinvestment in the refining side, but most of the growth has been on the chemicals and materials side.  What we\\'re seeing is, for the year, we’re forecasting, as I mentioned earlier to Doug\\'s question, we think we can probably do 8% or so for the year in chemical energy, which is remarkable turnaround given the fact that the prior two years actually had strong for us, but I can\\'t emphasize enough that there still are signs of caution, you may want to use the word conservatism, but I just say I\\'m just trying to be very pragmatic and think about what\\'s going on here and I’m saying, listen two good quarters of growth, okay.  Great. Let’s see how the next quarter shapes up and I keep coming back to 40% of that segment is still under pressure and our major customers here, those companies themselves are seeing a downgrade in their earnings forecast for the next 12 months. So all in all, a much better picture than we thought coming into the year, but still some reasons to be a little bit pragmatic in terms of how we view the future growth in Q4 and beyond. Maybe just second question would be on the DGG segment, since you guys didn’t do your annual investor meeting this year, I was hoping for a bit of a long term refresh on the strategy. You obviously have had good success with the guys didn\\'t do your show and you will. And that\\'s I mean if here I was hoping for a bit of a long term refresh on the strategy obviously had good success with the Dako asset, you talked about SureSelect and you\\'ve got obviously a lot of other investment and irons in the fire for NGS, I mean put that all together, how should we think about your appetite to invest strategically and organically in DGG relative to the rest of the company. I mean, it seems like there\\'s a good opportunity to add in to -- fill in some of the whitespace and I\\'m curious how high a priority that is? Yeah. We have a very large appetite in this space and a number of things have been happened. So if you look, Jacob has done a really excellent job in terms of addressing the fundamentals of the business, pathology business with double digit growth for us. When I first came in his role, a lot of questions about the future of the Dako acquisition, so we\\'ve got that. We get good growth there and we\\'re making a number of significant investments, both organically and inorganically. So a lot of our M&A has been focused in this area.  So whether it be the Multiplicom acquisition, Lasergen equity investment, the recent PopGen, so we have a lot of interest in this space. And as I mentioned earlier, not to put any pressure on Sam who happens to be in the room with me, but we brought in a new Head of Strategy and Corporate Development and really from the space, so we\\'re very interested in finding new ways for Agilent to grow in the space. We like the fundamentals of the market and we like our ability to take a bigger piece of that market. And just last question there is just given that it’s your small segment and the end market opportunities there are pretty vast, should we assume that will remain the highest growth segment in the company for the foreseeable future and just trying to put that all in context on the numbers? Well, I think all three group Presidents are fighting now to see who can grow them fast. So we think all of our business groups can grow. I think that there are some really unique fundamentals going on in DGG space which perhaps has a higher long term inherent growth rate on the markets. So we think they’re all going to be winners and maybe perhaps a little bit higher growth ultimately in DGG. Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Thank you, Crystal. On behalf of the management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us the call at Investor Relations and I’d like to wish you a good rest of the day and thank you again. Bye-bye.

I’m pleased to have an opportunity to continue to tell the Agilent story, a story of strong revenue and profit growth that we’ve been telling for the past three years. The Agilent team closed out 2017 with another strong quarter, capping off a tremendous year of revenue and profit growth. We again exceeded our growth expectations. Q4 revenues of $1.19 billion are up almost 6% on a core basis. Reflecting our commitment to improve as Agilent’s operating margins, our Q4 adjusted operating margin of 23.3% is up 80 basis points. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins. The strong revenue growth and margin improvements resulted in Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.67, an increase of 14%. Looking at the full year, we delivered a highest growth rate since the 2014 launch of the New Agilent. Our 2017 revenues of $4.47 billion are up 6.7% on the core basis. We have strong momentum going into 2018. Adjusted operating margin for the year is up 130 basis points over last year. And as you know, in 2015, I committed to increasing Agilent’s adjusted operating margin by 410 basis points over FY14’s adjusted operating margin to 22% by 2017. I’m pleased to announce that we’ve made this commitment and accomplished our goal. We are not done yet of course, but this is significant achievement by the Agilent team. We will continue to focus on making improvements in our operating results. The momentum in our business combined with our operational excellence drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year to $2.36 per share. Let me now take a minute or two to look closer what’s driving our stellar results. From an end market perspective, our chemical and energy revenue grew 15%. This was third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Growth was broad-based across the spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. We are encouraged by the uptake and reinvestment by our customers as they’re upgrading their labs and investing in next generation equipment. A return to growth accelerated in academia and government with 12% growth, which was above our expectations. Growth was broad based across product lines with particular strength in Europe and Americas. Our higher than expected growth has resulted in improved funding environment and market share gains. Food revenue grew 10% against the difficult compare of 10% in Q4 of last year. From a product perspective, the strength was broad based, led by services, consumables, mass spectrometry. Regionally, Europe and Asia drove the gains. Pharma revenue declined 5% against the difficult compare of 16% growth in Q4 of last year, which itself came on top of a 19% growth to Q4. We had been anticipating continued strong pharma investment levels with difficult compares slowing our reported market growth rates to mid-single digits. Some additional specifics of our Q4 results. As expected, the LC replacement cycle continues in this small molecule market segment, but at a slowing rate. NASD revenue also is down, as we expected. We noted in our Q3 call that NASD revenues are batch based which makes them vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of customer acceptance. Market demand however for the NASD API offering remains strong. Our product and geographic mix also contributed to the results. We experienced strong order demand from Europe and for higher end mass spectrometry technologies. The order to revenues cycle is longer for Europe in these types of products. We expect these revenues materialize in Q1 and Q2 of FY18. The biopharma segment of our pharma business remained strong along with services and consumables across the entire pharma end market. Diagnostics and clinical grew by 9% led by pathology and companion diagnostics. Continued strong end-market demand and market share gains are driving performance. Environmental and forensics grew 4%, in line with expectations. Concerns about the health of our environment continued to drive the market in Asia. Geographically, our Company results are driven by higher single digit growth in Europe and China. The Americas grew by mid single digits, and Asia excluding China and Japan grew by low single-digits. And finally, let’s turn to highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 4%. Market revenue was led by strength in chemical and energy, academia and government, and food, partially offset by declines in pharma. Double-digit growth in several platforms including mass spectrometry, microfluidics and cell analysis were key driver to reported growth. LSAG had a tremendous year on the innovation front, launching several new high-impact products such as the Ultivo LC-MS triple quad with a 70% smaller footprint than its predecessor. The Ultivo, which began shipping this November and other recent new product introductions are being well-received by the market. This gives us momentum going into 2018. The integration with recent acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems is going very well. Agilent’s CrossLab Group’s strong performance continued this quarter with 8% core revenue growth. Growth was healthy across services and consumables, most regions and end markets. Our CrossLab’s Service and Support organization hit a significant milestone, $1 billion in annual service orders for the first time in a single fiscal year. This milestone was accomplished ahead of our initial expectations. It validates our strategic focus on developing a service business for the entire lab. In a rather short period of time, our team has turned its services business into a key differentiated offering for Agilent. Through these services, we can as a strategic partner with our customers, helping them achieve greater lab efficiencies and outcomes. The customer response to our service offerings is overwhelmingly positive. Our chemistry business and ACG also continue to be awarded for technical innovation with double-digit growth in the AdvanceBio column portfolio for the fiscal year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong revenue growth of 7%. Demand is increasing for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We are seeing continued strength of our PD-L1 and molecular products. As expected, our new Nucleic Acid Solutions business was down for the quarter, given the product driven nature of the business. As previously mentioned, market demand for APIs for RNA-based therapeutics remains strong.  DGG achieved a major milestone this year, delivering a 20% operating margin exclusive of acquisitions for the first time. Three years ago, this business had a 13% operating margin; we have increased that to 20%, a tremendous achievement made possible by integrating and driving improvements in the former Dako business, bringing to the market compelling new offerings and executing on gross margin improvement initiatives. DGG continues to expand its market reach. We received several significant FDA approvals this quarter for offerings that help our customers in their efforts to fight cancer. We received FDA approval for expanded use of our PD-L1 cancer diagnostics for Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Opdivo. We have been closely collaborating with both companies. Our GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay received 510 clearance. This is our first comparative genomic hybridization assay approved by the FDA for diagnostic use. Our R&D advancements continue to yield differentiated and new products. At the American Society for Human Genetics Conference, we introduced our first expansion of the SureGuide pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This new offering will help accelerate research in the complex diseases and drug discovery. Agilent received the 2017 Scientists’ Choice Award for Best New Clinical Laboratory Product for the IQFISH Panel for Lung Cancer from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. This award is elected through online nomination and voting by scientists around the world. This demonstrates how we’re meeting our customers’ needs of products that win their trusts. Before touching on the 2018 outlook, I want to provide you with a perspective about our guidance philosophy and the market environment assumptions underlying our initial outlook. Later in the call, Didier will provide additional guidance specific. We entered 2017 thinking that China and the pharma market would be strong. We also pointed out at that time that we moved into a period of increasingly difficult quarterly compares for these markets. At the same time, we were uncertain about the outlook for Europe and the chemical and energy market. We closed out 2017 with China and the pharma market developing generally as expected; Europe and the chemical and energy market another hand exceeded our initial expectations growing 8% and 11% on a core basis respectively. We enter 2018 with a strong backlog and good visibility for the next one to two quarters. For the full year, we expect pharma to moderate down slightly from a 6% growth rate delivered in 2017. We expect China to maintain a high-single-digit growth rate. For Europe and the chemical and energy markets, while we experienced unexpectedly strong 2017 growth, we will cautiously guide to lower growth in FY18. A level of political and economic uncertainty persists across the globe, providing less visibility into second half 2018. We are taking a wait-and-see outlook for the European and chemical and energy markets. A few final comments about the next chapter in the Agilent story. 2017 was a stellar year for Agilent. We delivered our highest growth rate since the lunch of the new Agilent. We raised our operating margins 410 basis points in three years to 22%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 19%. While we’re busy improving our operating results, we’ve also been building the Company for the future. Our Agile Agilent program continues to streamline the Company as we upgrade our systems and infrastructure, and drive continued process improvements. We continue to build an even stronger portfolio through our revamped R&D programs and execution of our M&A strategy. We are delivering to the market truly differentiated offerings and augmenting our internal investments with acquisitions. These acquisitions are bringing to Agilent new capabilities and unique new offerings. We then leverage our Company scale to drive revenue and create cost synergies. Our one Agilent cultural transformation is changing the way we work, improving the customer experience; it’s a key driver of our excellent results. We’ve just completed the third year of our Company transformation. We now have a solid foundation in place, a proven track record of doing what we say we will do, and of executing winning a growth strategy. I often tell the Agilent team that the best is yet to come. We have momentum and I believe Agilent’s prospects have never been stronger.  Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Didier. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high-end of our guidance. We delivered core revenue growth of 5.8% and 6.7% ,respectively; and our operating margin was up 80 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively. Just as importantly, we reached the goal set in March 2014 to achieve 22% operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight in fiscal year 2017. Our full year EPS at $2.36 is 19% higher than the previous year. Our operating cash flow for the full year at $889 million is $39 million above the increased guidance provided last quarter and $96 million or 12% higher than fiscal year 2016, reflecting a strong overall performance. CapEx spending was $176 million, lower than our initial guidance of $200 million as some CapEx related to our new Nucleic Acid facility was pushed into fiscal year 2018. Turning to capital returns for the year, we paid $170 million in dividends and repurchased $194 million worth of shares. I’ll now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2018. Although we are comfortable with the present revenue and EPS consensus estimate, we believe as we did in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 that it is appropriate to have a cautious first guidance of the year. Our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance of $4.72 billion to $4.74 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on the October 31st exchange rates, and currency has a 1.3% positive impact on revenues. We project fiscal year 2018 adjusted operating margin of 22.2% to 22.7% and fiscal year 2018 EPS of $2.50 to $2.56, growing 7% at midpoint. If market conditions and our performance continue as strong as we are presently seeing, we stand ready to reflect the ongoing strength as we set quarterly guidance in the future. As you update your models for fiscal year 2018, please consider the following 10 points. First, annual salary increases will be effective December 31, 2017. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $72 million. As we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $31 million. Third, depreciation is projected to be $101 million for the fiscal year. Fourth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 18%. Fifth, we plan to pay $192 million in dividends, as the Board just approved a dividend increase of 13%. Over the last three years, we will have increased our dividend by nearly 50%. Sixth, as for buybacks, we registered 10b5-1 in September that includes two tranches with the maximum overall spend of $380 million. The first tranche is to ensure the repurchase of 2.7 million shares with daily execution throughout the year, to maintain our diluted share count at about 326 million shares on average for the year. The second tranche as in the previous years is opportunistic. Seventh, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed the diluted share count of 326 million, i.e. we have assumed that the opportunistic tranche does not get triggered. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $59 million, and other income at $14 million. Ninth, we expect operating cash flow of $970 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, which includes about $110 million to complete the new nucleic acid factory that will be operational in 2019. And tenth, the projected tax rate and cash flow exclude any impact from the potential U.S. tax reform. Finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.145 billion to $1.165 billion, and EPS of $0.55 to $0.57. At midpoint, revenue will grow 5.25% year-over-year on the core basis and EPS will grow 6%. At customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the strong loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please? So, can we you talk a little bit about the pharma results in the quarter. Just can you parse out the contribution or the lack of contribution from the NASD versus the European rev rec for us? And then, I’ve got a couple of follow-ups on that. Sure. Happy to do so, Derik. So, I’d point you to three comments on our Q4 results in pharma. The first, the one that we’ve been signaling for most of the year which is tough compares. We came off 16% growth in Q4 last year then we had 19% Q4 the prior year. Second piece is the revenue recognition timing, and I think there’s two aspects of that. One is the NASD business which we described in the call as really being a batch based business, kind of depends on when the customer wants to finish up the batch. But the overall market demand looks really good for these products. And then, as you are indicating, we had really strong results in mass spec and in Europe. And typically, we don’t -- they will be order results. Typically, we don’t talk about order, but we wanted to give you a sense of the strength of our pharma business in these areas and how it translates into revenue going into the first half of next year. The third piece would be that we are seeing expected slowing of the LC replacement cycle in small molecule side. So, those are three major drivers of our -- behind our Q4 performance in pharma. Just to remind, we ended up right on our full year guide. So, we came in at 6%, right where we thought we would in terms of pharma. To your specific question, I would say the bulk of the downward trend in the quarter had related to the LC replacement cycle and the shift in European business, probably less than 15%, 20% was NASD, right? And just following up on this. I mean, last quarter, people were sort of having questions about inventory destocking in the biotech and pharma just because there were some mix results. It seems like also a little bit of that this quarter, but not as pronounced. So, you are still not seeing anything other than tough comps that’s making nervous in terms of the pharma, biotech markets? No. In fact, that’s why we went on our way to give you some additional detail in this call, because fundamentals in pharma are still very strong. And then, the biopharma segment in particular has been a continued area of really strong growth for us, and we called that out in our script as well. The guidance for next year of 40 bps of operating margin expansion; you guys have obviously been trending above that; we have been modeling about 100 bps for next year. Just, is that all the offset in the API investment or are there other areas your reinvesting? So, I think the question related -- good afternoon, Tycho. And the question of Tycho was we’ve got about 40 basis points of improvement in our guide, he’d been modeling more like 100. Is the API, investments that are causing the gap? No, API had no -- the Nucleic Acid facility had no impact there. No, we just -- as we did last year at the same time, are cautious overall and have an operating margin that ties with our cautious revenue growth for the guidance. So, it’s consistent and hopefully we did the way, we did last year. And I guess also that Tycho very much like last year, I made the comment that the management team continues to have a goal on operating margin that is higher than the guide that we just gave you. And then, can you maybe comment on chemical and energy, where you are incrementally more positive? I think you said exploration is now growing; there are some nuances there you can call out. And as we think about a year ahead, how should we think about chemical and energy? Yes. Sure, happy to do. And then, I’ll let Patrick in the Q&A, if I missed anything. But, we actually -- we now have seen a much more broader based growth scenario across entire spectrum of the chemical and energy market. In prior calls, we only had been focusing on that 60%, which is the chemical side of that space. We’re now seeing reinvestment occurring also in refining as well as exploration. Anything to add to that, Patrick? You’re absolutely right. We see now really the pent-up demand is kicking in and we see the replacement, we see replacement coming as expected. Yes. So, we’re guiding to try probably mid-single-digit growth or 5ish next year for chemical, as I mentioned in my -- in energy, as I mentioned in my call script. We’re pretty confident about the first half and on a wait and see for the second half. And then last, when you increased the dividend, it was a small increase, small dividend. But, anything to read in that in terms of capital allocation, particularly as we think about the M&A landscape, your price are still pretty high? I think our strategy all along has been a balanced capital allocation policy, and part of that has been to continue to find ways to return cash to our shareholders and part of that formula for us has been increase in the cash dividends, up almost 50% over the last three. So, no read through on the M&A.. I think this is as more, I think a validation of our doing what we say we’re going to do. My question is actually on costs takeout and incremental margins. If we go back to the financial plan, introduce subsequent to the introduction of Agile Agilent program, introduce a series of plans, taking out some number of tens of millions of dollars cost per year. Some of those plans, going into 2018, 2019, and then more recently heard more about shared services savings. So, I wondered if you could give us a sense for relative to those objectives, how you’re thinking about, within the context of the guidance for 2018 and 2019, just succeeding on hitting those objectives where they would have an 2018, 2019 impact, are we assuming that those targets get hit, are we assuming that they don’t hit and we’re taking wait and see approach on execution? No, I think we’re really quite pleased with our ability to execute. I think three years ago when we laid out -- I think it was pretty audacious goal at the time to do 410 basis points. And you saw us through -- those following three years, how we through a constant drumbeat of execution were able to deliver on that 410 basis points. We have had same operational discipline today, it still exists and exists going forward. So, we have a whole series of plans inside the Company continue to sustain this ability to improve the operating margins. As you know, we’ve indicated at our prior AID that would be greater than 22 and this guide is consistent with that. But we’re quite confident in ability to hit the guide that Didier just gave you. Yes. And just, if -- we are very consistent, as Mike said, with what we stated last year. In fact, it’s amazing, because last year we provided our first guidance with 4 to 4.5%, exactly like this year in core revenue growth, and 50 basis points improvement in operating margin, which is same thing as this year. We ended by beating our operating margin first guidance by 80 basis points to 22%. And obviously… Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my other question relates to the buyback. You mentioned there are two tranches to the buyback; one, more maintenance, one, more as you say opportunistic. I wondered if you could spend a little bit more time on thinking around the buyback, the scale of the buyback. Balance sheet is obviously very strong. How you make the decision about whether you allocate more to the buyback or not or potentially expand it? Thanks.  Yes. As Mike stated, we do want to have a very balanced capital deployment policy, which we presented to the Board, both to support organic growth via CapEx to support inorganic growth, so to support business as well as dividends and buybacks. So, $380 million with the big chunk of that being automatic since -- in line with our balanced capital deployment policy. Yes. We’ve been talking on the rate scenario, about a percent of the outstanding shares, and that clearly would represent that. And then, as we mentioned earlier, our continued primary focus for the use of the cash and the strength of our balance sheet is invest in the business, either through M&A we think that makes sense, the right valuation; and then, as you know, we are investing fairly heavily on the CapEx side right now.  Yes. And if they would be more opportunistic as part of the U.S. tax reform to repatriate more cash, our intent would be to allocate it under the similar fashion and to maintain our present policy. Thanks, good afternoon. Didier, maybe start-up one for you. Could you walk us through your core growth assumptions for 2018 by segment as well as the SBUs, so sort of end market and between LSAG, CrossLab and DGG? Yes. Overall, we had our slowest growth, I would say for ‘18 which would be along academic and government, and environmental and forensics around 3%, and then the most important growth would be in diagnostics and clinical, not exactly the DGG, 6%; and the rest is in between so, you have chemical and energy… Okay. That’s helpful. And one for Mike. Curious to hear your thoughts on how you would characterize the quality of the R&D pipeline right now? And I think of late, you started implementing what you kind of referred to as a product cycle management system. Can you sort of walk us through exactly what is and whether there any P&L benefits associated with that kind of over time that we should expect? Yes, happy to answer both questions. I am going to invite again Patrick on the second as well he is the executive sponsor on our PLM program. But, we’re super excited by the strength of our R&D pipeline. And you may have noticed in my earnings call script, I talked about how we’ve revamped our R&D programs a few years ago. Now, you are seeing some great things come to market. And as I tell my team all time, we are not done yet. So, we have a nice rhythm of continued introductions we are planning over the next few years across all three groups. So, we are really pleased with how our teams -- the ideas we have but also our teams are actually executing on delivering to the market. And you are exactly right, I think we called this out in our last call, but we’re investing pretty heavily right now in a new -- it’s actually I think our first ever product lifecycle management system which really will give -- a new one, been a while I think Patrick. And this is really going to drive a lot of efficiencies in the R&D process as well as it’s going to drive continued reductions in cost of sales because of -- why don’t you share some of the details, Patrick? Thanks Mike and thanks for the positive comment on the new product. So, the focus of this program is really on improving R&D efficiency and new product introduction. The efficiencies that we will implement a new product lifecycle management tool, which takes really a lot of the manual processes we still have today, make sure that we’re in full compliance also on medical device side as we bring more and more products from neonatal  business into clinical environment. And with this, focus on improving the tools and processes, we are really shooting for much higher throughput from our R&D program that we have potential . We are really pleased with the work we have and I would say we are definitely positioned well to continue capture market share by bringing more of these breakthrough products to the market like we did last year, as we did , Ultivo product, , you name it. There is a whole suite of new products out there. We have a strong pipeline and I think it was time for us to update tools and processes in R&D as well and new product introduction, make sure that we get the best efficiency possible out of our engineering group. 2018 will be a year of investment. But, as you go out in the next few years, you can see reasons why we think we can continue to improve the effectiveness of our R&D investments as well as continue to lower our cost of sales. We are investing to make it happen. It’s not just hope and a prayer. Didier, based on your cash flow guidance, it seems like after backing out CapEx, dividends and the first tranche of buybacks to counter share creep that you’d still have over $350 million of cash flow to be deployed. And this is assuming you don’t beat your guidance which you characterized as conservative. Should we view the other $350 million plus in cash flow is being there for M&A and the opportunistic buyback you describe, what we should think of as at least the initial budget for those sources of cash? No. We look at the M&A on the standalone basis, so based on how much value we can create through those programs. We clearly are not limited by, for example, how much cash flow we will have left over from what we generate during the year. In any case, if it is U.S. M&A and there is a tax reform, we’ll have to borrow to fund the acquisitions. But, we have much larger financial capabilities in terms of M&A, and the number that you are quoting. And we have a very, very significant pipeline, all three presidents on a regular basis, present to Mike and me whole set of potential acquisitions. And that’s beyond the number that -- in terms of the number that you’re quoting -- you have quoted. Okay. And then, I guess, just as further clarification, if $350 million is isn’t towards M&A and you have the additional budget and additional sources for M&A as you described, where does that 350 go? Is that largely towards those opportunistic buybacks? It goes into outside of the U.S. The issue that we have dealt with on an ongoing basis is that we -- most of the cash that we generate, we generate outside of the U.S. So, if we intend to spend it in the U.S. -- and it is true that if we only spend “$380 million” this year and buy back, we still have opportunities the Board gave us back in May of 2015, larger allowance to use our three years. So, we do have an opportunity there to spend more money on buyback. But if we do that, it will have, it will be funded through increasing U.S. debt. And I just want to go back to -- I think it was Derik’s first question on pharma growth. Would you be willing to specifically quantify what pharma growth would have been excluding the NASD impact? And based on your comments on mass spec and European order results recognizing your commentary in your prepared remarks, is the expectation in guidance that those European and mass spec orders that you called out, turn into revenue in Q1 and Q2? Yes, happy to provide additional insights, Doug. So, the first piece is that of the 5% decline, we saw in Q4 2017 over Q3 2016, 1 percentage point of that came from NASD. The second piece of it is, will we expect to have the revenue show up in Q1 and Q2, yes, absolutely. So, these tend to have a three to four-month cycle from order to revenue. And like I said earlier, we don’t typically talk about orders, but we wanted to make sure that we make clear that the pharma business remains quite solid for Agilent and we have a nice backlog. Just maybe going back to the new product discussion. Obviously, a lot of focus on the Intuvo replacement cycle. Can you just maybe talk to how material you think contributions there are likely to be next year? I think it’s a very similar kind of story you’ve heard from us in the past. I think you’ll start to see increasing levels of direct contribution of that product to our top-line revenues. As you know, in the past, we’ve also talked about the halo effect it’s had on all the aspects, or I guess from a targeted portfolio as our product is just reinforced, who is the leader by far in this space. So, a lot of the growth in the chemical and energy space is being fueled by gas chromatography sales. So, we expect it to be a continually larger contributor to our growth. And as you know, that’s -- we’ve got our guide outside of the clinical diagnostics market. We have chemical and energy as our second strongest market next year in terms of our initial thinking for overall growth rate. And Intuvo is expected to be a contributor there. Okay, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up for you or Didier, just on the outlook. I believe the comment there was that you were comfortable with the consensus number for 2018. I mean, I guess if we were to think about you’re getting to core growth, it’s more like 6 and 4 next year. What businesses seem like most likely you’ve gotten in there, which -- where do you feel the segments are most conservative in the outlook? Thanks. Yes. I would just reemphasize a few points I made in my call script. By the way, I talked about in my narrative, kind of remind everyone that last year things turned out -- we’re just super pleased with how this year progressed, but there was some uncertainty last year. And things don’t always turn out exactly how you think, that’s why we’re taking a sort of wait and see, as it relates to the second half of the year for the Company. I think the two areas to keep an eye on, a little bit growth rates in Europe sustain at these unexpected levels we’ve seen over the last quarters and the other one is chemical and energy. So, I think those are the two watch ones for you to keep an eye on in terms of where the upside could be, if those growth rates continue at the same rate we’ve seen the past few quarters. I was just wondering if you could walk through some focus areas for DGG next year, be it expanding multiple comps offerings more globally or any new product launches to call out? Yes, absolutely. I’m delighted to give Jacob a question on this call. So, this is -- and again, we were just so pleased with the results for DGG this year. Team really hit a major milestone of achieving significant improvement in operating margin for the business and really think we’re seeing the benefits of how we’ve turned the former Dako business around. So with that, Jacob, let’s move away from the past and talk about the future? Yes. Thank you for that. And I see, as 2017 was strong, I continue to see also that 2018 is going to be strong, actually across all our five divisions, and you start out with Multiplicom. We have now integrated Multiplicom into Agilent infrastructure. So, we can now really take the full advantage of Agilent’s reach. So, I’m pretty pleased and I’m expecting a lot out of Multiplicom in 2018. But I see that also very much in a combination with our old technologies. We will of course continue to invest into the  which is the former  platform, combining our bioinformatics pipeline with our strong presence in target enrichment, Multiplicom being one but clearly also SureSelect and HaloPlex, that we speak a lot to the genomics. And our whole strategy will continue to be to move into the clinic and build a full workflow around our offering here. We continue to see strong growth in the pathology business where PD-L1 has been a great success story. But, really, also on this platform, it’s having a lot of momentum. So, I also continue to see a lot of traction in that space. And then, obviously, the NASD business, we see a lot of tailwind there. We are -- we will continue to be really limited by our capacities. Really pleased to see that announcements coming out in the market about the RNAi drugs getting close to commercialization and we start to see a lot of interest by lot of other pharma companies out there. Just wanted to take a step back and look at the pharma issue from more of a macro level. It does seem like the comments you’ve made all basically amount to a fairly material deceleration in pharma end market growth in 2018. And if I kind of think about the elements that you’ve called out, it sounds like maybe the replacement cycle in LC might be the driver of that. I guess, first question is that, is that the right way of thinking about it? And then, if so, what are kind of the macro things happening in the pharma end market right now that you might draw line to as the major factors there? Sure, Tim, happy to provide perspectives. First of all, I would actually characterize a little bit differently. I wouldn’t characterize it as a pharma issue. For the last 12 to 18 months, we have been calling this. We have been saying that when we think about the pharma market, think about two segments, small molecule and large molecule. Large molecule biopharma, very, very strong, continue to be very strong. There are still investments going on in the small molecule side but we’ve been saying that there is going to be a slowing of a growth rate because you get to the difficult compares and investment levels aren’t going to keep increasing at those 15%, 19% kind of growth rates. So, we actually don’t see it as a pharma issue at all. This is actually developing exactly as we had bought. That’s why I mentioned earlier that our full year guide last year had us 6%. And Didier I think we ended up pretty much close on 6% for the year. And then, there is some good fundamentals. I mean, there is the NASD business, which you know is batch based. We know that the demand is there for 2018. We’ve got very good demand for mass spec products in the pharma space. And then, if you look at the numbers, our ACG business continues to be strong, both on the services and consumables side. So, we actually don’t see pharma as an issue. We see it as continued area of strength for the Company. But we’ve been signaling for some time that there will be some moderation of overall growth rates in this segment, primarily because obviously of large numbers and difficult compares. So, one in terms of cash, I think you’re coming up on the decision related to the final Lasergen payment. Is that something we should embed in the 2018 forecast? And then, just any updates on development of a clinical NGS workflow? So, what I’ll do is provide you some comments around the guidance, inclusion or exclusion and then maybe Didier, you can just provide a few voiceover on how things are going with Lasergen. So, as a reminder, we have the ability to make a call option -- calling option in 2018. Just like any other M&A possibility, it’s not included in our guides at this point in time. So, Jacob, if you comment on how things are going? Yes. I would say, we have a very good relationship with Lasergen, and I I’m very pleased to see the Lasergen team and our Agilent come together. And as you might recall, we are not only get to develop an instrument but full workflow. So, what’s very important is that the teams work together, both for the instrument, but also for the full solution. So, the whole workflow works together. And I see that -- that we have very good momentum here and things are moving forward according to our expectations. And then maybe one more for Jacob, while we’re on it, the margin expansion in DGG. Obviously, another great year there. Just help us, what do you think the long-term opportunity is here, how far do you think you can push margins over time? I’d say that I am very proud of the team of what we delivered over the three years, of 700 basis points improvements with the CAGR of 8% over last three years growth. That is a very impressive turnaround of a business. We will continue to look at expansions. But, I can tell you that we don’t want to go with the same rate we have done over the last few years. We think -- we are out there with industry, with the average of industry and obviously we’ll continue to improve. But we will also make sure that we invest into the business going forward. Yes. Good afternoon, Paul. Right on schedule. So, just as a reminder, the plan has been to complete the construction in our 2018 and then move into validation process, which is probably 9 to 12 months, we think Jacob. But then, we’re looking at maybe second half 2019 back half is when we start to see some revenue coming out of that facility. And just as a reminder, the first, a full year capacity would add approximately $100 million of revenue to the Company. It’s really quite an impressive new facility we’re building, I had a chance to visit. And the construction is moving on quite well and we’re now into the final phases. So, we have a much better view of -- and confidence if you will in terms of the timeline. So, it’s a very unique facility, but we’re getting pretty close to the end. So, we have a high degree of confidence on the timeline. And then, also, you’d mentioned on the diagnostic side, your FISH panel won award. Now, are you getting traction in your FISH panel for PD-L1 due to automation accuracy? But I know automation had been issue in the past years, I guess that’s solve or what’s the color around that? Yes. What I’d like to -- let me make some additional comments and Jacob, please jump in here. But as Jacob pointed out, he used the word attraction of the Omnis platform and I think that’s where historically the former Dako organization had some gaps in its offering, relative to automation. We came out with the new platform almost like a three years ago and really it’s been well accepted in the market. You’ve seen us talk about from big wins like the Quest win here in the U.S. And I think that’s been on the -- part of this been on the strength of the new automation platform. Anything else, you’d add there, Jacob? I will say that all our IHC and PD-L1 is automated on one platform or the other. And we obviously have the strategy of having PD-L1 automated on both of our platforms going forward. The same on FISH, the Omnis platform was built primarily IHC but also for the FISH assays. And it’s actually automated on -- the FISH is automated on Omnis today. So, you can actually do that already today. Okay. And then, Mike, just to refresh, on pharma you were talking 6% growth this year, but a little lower in your guidance. Is that what you had mentioned? Yes, absolutely, Paul. So, what we had said was a slight moderation I think in the 4% to 5% for next year. No. The main reason there is a slight downward movement in terms of the outlook is really just based on the small molecule side of that segment that we’ve always felt that that’s what will continue, but not at the high double digit rate. So, this is more a question of really tough compares. The overall fundamentals are really solid. The comments around Europe really had to do with the timing of why we believe that we’ll have the kind of numbers we talked about in pharma next year, because there could be some questions raised, right, which is minus 5% Q4, 2017, there; is there something fundamentally a concern there. And we’ve gone out of our way in this call and really tried indicate no. And in fact, the order backlog is quite solid in the number of product categories which we’ve not yet seen revenues for, and that we’ve been thinking this is exactly how the market would develop. So, this is not at all surprise to us. Hi, Mike, thanks for that. Just a quick question on the GST. Was there impact from that in the quarter from India? Yes. There was a little bit of an impact. And I think as everyone who -- each of our competitors who is operating in India has also identified a slowdown due to the fact that customers and companies are just linked to the new agreement. And we think over the next few months, it will build -- the business will return to normal. It did have some impact on the pharma reported numbers, because we’re heavily weighted towards pharma in India. But we didn’t want to give you a whole -- of all kinds of details. But that did have some impact on our Q4 pharma results, although the business is coming. Okay, thanks for that. And if I could ask a bit of a strategy question on the LSAG business. I mean, traditionally, the LCMS instruments competed more on the sense of the end resolution, and now you have successfully kept those with Ultivo and brought about a smaller size and potential greater ease of use here. Could you maybe elaborate how that’s translating to it? I know this is early, so the instruments are starting getting out. Are those the same customers that are appreciating the same product or are you getting new customers into the mix? Thanks. Actually very good question. When we launched the Ultivo, we really launched it with a perspective that we want to dominate what we call the routine applications out there. And we are going first for food and environmental spaces, given the mass range the product has. It is a product that is really tailored towards ease of use and meeting the sensitivity needs that you mentioned as well for the targeted applications. I think this product will display a lot of strength in other areas as well. So, we will extend the range around Ultivo going forward. But when you talk about the overall strategy for LCMS, we are not entirely focused just on the routine markets. As you know, we have launched a bio solution very successfully which drives a lot of growth in the biopharma market as well. So, with both playing in triple quad as well as top  space where we think there we have plenty of opportunity to still gain market share. And to Mike’s comment on strong R&D pipeline, LCMS is clearly one of the big bets we have in the Company, very heavily investing in R&D. Two questions for you. First, just following up on the Ultivo. It just started shipping this month. I was wondering if you could comment on what your capacity looks like for that system. And I guess with that, what kind of contribution can new products contribute in 2018? And then, I have a follow up. Yes. So, I think relative to the question about capacity is from a manufacturing standpoint, no issue at all. So, we’ve -- in fact, we are right now our launch plan with our manufacture lease have incurred at schedule. And you may have noticed in my call, we actually have begun shipping the product. And I think we don’t call out specifically, the revenue impact on new products. But, I would say this is just part of our formula. So, over the last three years, we have been out going to market, and we just put up our biggest growth rate in the history of the new Agilent, although I think I officially retired this, I had to stop using that new Agilent. But I think that’s part of our formula of success and I think that’s why I used the word momentum a few times in my script because we really feel like both in terms of the products that we’ve released over the 12 to 18 months plus the products we know that come out in ‘18 will continue to have momentum because each of our three business groups have a pretty robust set of R&D development activities and commercialization plans for next year as well. Sure, thank you. I just was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment within the CrossLab of lab service business. One of your competitors made a comment a week or two ago regarding some wins and just if there’s any changes going on in the competitive environment for lab service outsourcing? Well, thanks, Steve. And as far as the business is concerned we continue to see very robust demand for our services. And as you look at the deals, they come and go; there is nothing particularly material that we have in play that would actually change our trajectory for growth. So, for us, we continue to see, not only opportunity for the services in pharma but we are seeing stretch now into the broader aspect of commercial laboratories. And as Mike had said, we continue to bring to market robust set of capabilities into next year. So, from a broader market perspective around services, lab wide, demand is still there and we expect good demand going forward? Yes. Steve, I’m glad you asked that question, because as you know the creation of the Agilent CrossLab Group was on the major initiatives that came out with three years ago. And I can remember the time when we got off to a really good start, is it sustainable. And I think you’ve seen Mark and the team have been able to deliver high single digit growth for quarter in, quarter out. I think it really speaks to the power of the value prop to the customers. Sorry to harp on this, but in terms of revenue order push out on the pharma side. Is that what’s driving? I know you’re talking about recognize it early in fiscal 2018. Is that what’s driving the 1Q growth higher than rest of the year, calling for 5.25 in 1Q, the rest of the year close to 3.5. So, just wondering, does that make up that delta -- is it adding as much as 1% or 2%? Patrick, thanks for the questions. I’m glad you noticed that our Q1 revenue guide is higher than our full year guide at this point in time. And clearly, the pharma order to revenue conversion is part of the story. But I think just a greater story here, which is momentum in all three of the businesses. And that’s why we wanted to reflect it in our Q1 guides. Listen, we don’t know right now how the second half of the year will play out. But, we’ve got a good feel for the first -- next quarter too. And that’s why you’ve seen us guide higher than our full year core growth guide. So, Didier, I think this is departure from last year where when we actually guided lower in Q1 2017. So, pharma is part of that, but is not the exclusive part. I mean, this European mass spec story is part of that, but not the exclusive story for strength of our Q1 guide. And then, on China, high-single-digit a bit on the low-end of the recent range and it’s been more of double-digit grower for you guys. Anything to call out in the environment there or is it just purely a comp story? Thanks for this question as well. So, you may recall, last year, Q4 2017, we had 27% growth in China and 27% growth in what is our second largest market. We had been calling for a 10% growth for the full year, for China. And that’s exactly where we landed. So, we’re super pleased again with how the China business has developed over the year, right according to plan. Key contributor to growth and 10% growth this year for the full year off a very difficult compare, we are really quite pleased with result. So going into 2018, we’re expecting us to be in that – continue to be in that high-single-digit growth rate for China. So, continue to be an important contributor to the Company’s growth. Now that the transformation is complete, there is no more new Agilent, you’ve hit your targets, how should investors think about the operating model, going forward in a normalized year? Is the 2018 guidance the right way to think about it, a mid single digit core revenue growth rate and high single digit EPS growth rate? I think -- first, I’d say, the transformation is probably never done. What we’ve done is we hit some milestones for the Company, because we put out some three-year goals for the company. I think what I’d ask you to think about is, we believe that we will continue to grow earnings above revenue. We believe that we will continue to outgrow the market and our operating margin expansion track will continue. We’ve been very deliberate in terms of how we’ve improved our operating margins. And I think as Jacob kind of hit on this as well, which is we haven’t done anything that will compromise our ability to grow long-term. And I think that’s served us well. So, we’ve been taking cost out and improving our operations over the last several years. And we’ve been doing it in such a manner that has allowed us to really continue to sustain our growth. And then, I think the foundation of this company is set for continued outperformance. So, I would just say that way I ask you think about the Company is a company that can generate earnings growth faster than revenue growth and that whatever market environment that we encounter, we’ll be able to outgrow the competition. And we have this whole constant improvement we call our Agile Agilent program inside the Company, which is a mindset of continued process improvement. So, we think we are going to continue to be able streamline the Company and improve operating margin. We haven’t however put out as you know three-year long-term goals beyond the fact that we’re going to do better each year. And then, my follow-up, I’m trying to understand what some of the levers are in the second half revenue guidance of low single digit core. And specifically, how sensitive is that in your minds or even in your customers’ mind to the price of oil? Does that assume that oil goes back down to 45? And if it stays at 55, you would do better than those numbers or anything you can speak to on that front? No, I think, if you look at comments, we’re all kind of looking -- try to say that’s probably not the biggest driver, I would look at PMI. And I think, PMI is a better indicator of the overall growth in our chemical and energy business. Clearly, price of oil has some impact, but PMI is a major driver; there is a very high correlation. So if the trends will continue, then we’re probably in good shape in the second half, but we’ll have to see. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Thank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of all of the Agilent management team, thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us. In today\\'s call, I want to cover our Q1 business results and talk about Agilent\\'s business momentum. Let\\'s start with the business results. I\\'m happy to report that the Agilent team delivered an outstanding start to 2018. We exceeded our own growth and earnings expectations. We continue to outgrow the market. Q1 revenues of $1.21 billion grew 10% on a core basis, and we continue to improve our operating margins. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% is up 130 basis points from Q1 of last year. I\\'m proud to report that this is our 12th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins. The combination of strong revenue growth and continued margin improvements drove an adjusted EPS of $0.66 for the quarter, well above our expectations. Adjusted EPS is up 25% over the first quarter of last year. Now on to Agilent\\'s business momentum. When I use the term momentum, I\\'m describing strong, broad-based growth for all our businesses as we outgrow the market. In this context, our momentum remains very strong. First, our chemical and energy revenue grew 13% with broad strength in all product categories. Customers are investing across the spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in this market segment. After a long period of deferred investment, we are now seeing increased capital expenditures. Pharma is our largest business and had a strong showing of 8% growth. Growth is very solid across instruments, services and consumables in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives. Academia and government sustained its recent trajectory with 11% growth. Growth was driven by strength in China and Europe. Food revenue grew 8% against a difficult compare of 11% in Q1 2017. Europe growth led our strong results with broad-based strength across instruments, services and consumables. Diagnostic and clinical revenue grew 5% as expected, led by strong demand for companion diagnostics and pathology products. Environmental forensics grew 14%. Our forensic business was particularly robust driven by U.S. government purchases. Environmental growth remained healthy with solid demand for GC, GC/MS and ICP/MS. Geographically, China led the gains with strong high teens growth. Europe and the Americas delivered healthy high single-digit growth. Looking at the highlights from our business groups, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 11%, fueled by double-digit growth in major platforms led by mass spectrometry and cell analysis, demand in Europe and China and broad strength across end markets. On the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Luxcel Biosciences. Luxcel has developed a portfolio of cell-based assay kits that allow researchers to evaluate cell metabolism and function on standard fluorescent plate readers. This technology is highly complementary to our Seahorse Bioscience offerings and further enhances our position in the fast-growing cell analysis space. Our internal focus on innovation continues to receive external recognition. The Ultivo Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system was recognized as one of the top 2017 innovations by The Analytical Scientist. And,  Instrument Business Outlook recognized Agilent as the Company of the Year in the Life Sciences tools market for our innovation across the company. Agilent\\'s CrossLab Group continued the strong performance with 9% core revenue growth. The Agilent CrossLab strategy, launched three years ago, continues to yield exceptional results. Our services business is focused on supporting customers to deliver greater lab efficiencies. As a result, services growth was strong across all regions and markets. We continue to introduce new capabilities for our customers. For example, we launched Agilent Care which extends and expands solution support beyond the traditional first 90 days of solution ownership. We also expanded the CrossLab Service Guarantee to our multi-vendor service business. If an Agilent instrument under contract cannot be repaired, it\\'ll be replaced with the Agilent equivalent. This improves confidence in Agilent as a customer focused service provider for multivendor instruments. This guarantee differentiates Agilent from our competitors and in the eyes of our customers. Fueled by our innovation investment, our consumables business was strong across both chemistries and supplies. Recently introduced new products and biopharma applications are making a difference in our reported growth. Agilent\\'s Captiva Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid technology is one example. The Analytical Scientist also recognized it as a top 2017 innovation. Our digital investments are delivering new capability to our customers. We have deployed groundbreaking e-commerce initiatives such as e-renewal of support contracts, making it easier for customers to do business with Agilent. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Demand continued to be healthy for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We shipped our first comparative genomic hybridization assay for diagnostic use in the U.S., GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay this quarter. We also made available to customers CRISPR activation and interference libraries. Targeted at the research community, these libraries use state-of-the-art validated gene targets that enable easy and a flexible implementation of targeted functional assays for the entire genome. Now, looking ahead, a few comments on our updated outlook for the rest of the year. We continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look at the business and stand ready to raise our full-year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. As such, we are now raising our full-year growth and earnings guidance with our strong Q1 in the books. Didier will share the specifics of the updated guidance, inclusive of the forecasted impact from the new U.S. tax law. While future market conditions are often difficult to predict, I can confidently predict that Agilent will outgrow the market in any encountered market conditions. A few closing comments before I hand off the call to Didier. First, I\\'m very pleased with our start to 2018. Following our stellar year in 2017, the Agilent team continued to deliver a differentiated customer experience, a great product portfolio and excellent operating results. The transformational strategies initiated we launched three years ago continue to work. We are maintaining our momentum. We are delivering on our measures of success to outgrow the market, improve operating margins and deploy capital in a balanced manner. Our One Agilent culture is built on a foundation of core values that puts the customer at the center of everything we do. Agilent\\'s collaborative work environment enables the leveraging of the full power of our team. As a result, our team provides a superior customer experience while focused on operational excellence, a combination that allows us to produce results. We continue our commitment to our Agile Agilent program. This transformational initiative continues to streamline the company\\'s operations and drive efficiencies. Our portfolio transformation and innovation engine continues to provide our customers with truly differentiated technology and solutions. Our innovation efforts are complemented by a focused M&A strategy. Our portfolio of offerings is second to none and will continue to strengthen. As evidenced in our track record of impressive results, Agilent has started 2018 with strength. The results speak for themselves. It\\'s what gives me the confidence to tell our team the best is yet to come. Thank you for being on the call. And I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand over the call to Didier. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q1 performance, well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered a core revenue growth of 9.7% versus a core revenue growth of 4.8% in Q1 of last year, and our adjusted operating margin at 22.5% was up 130 basis points versus Q1 of last year. Our EPS at $0.66 was $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 25% on a year-over-year basis. Currency had a favorable impact on revenues of $32 million and $6 million versus last year in guidance respectively and an impact on operating profit of $8 million and $0 million versus last year and guidance respectively. Our operating cash flow of $215 million was 85% higher than in Q1 of last year. And finally, we bought back $47 million worth of shares and paid $48 million in dividends. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2018. We are significantly raising the core revenue growth guidance of 4% to 4.5%. The new core revenue growth guidance is 5.25% to 5.75%. Also, the weakening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a positive impact of $108 million on full year reported revenue. The total impact of the increase in core revenue guidance and of the currency tailwind is an increase in midpoint revenue guidance of $165 million. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2018 revenues of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion. Turning to EPS. We are also significantly increasing our November guidance of $2.50 to $2.56. The new guidance is $2.62 to $2.68 with $0.04 of the $0.12 increase due to currency. We\\'re also raising our operating cash flow guidance from $970 million to $1.050 billion. There\\'s no change to our expectation to buy back 2.7 million shares and to maintain our diluted share count at 326 million shares. Lastly, I\\'ll provide some insights on the impact of the U.S. tax reform. Because our fiscal year started before the enactment of the new law, we will enjoy the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018. However, the negative effects, mostly the so-called guilty tax of the tax reform will not impact us until fiscal year 2019. However, because these benefits, net benefit of 2 to 3 points would only be temporary, we have decided not to reflect it in our fiscal year 2018 pro forma tax rate and now therefore maintaining the rate at 18%, as we expect this will be our tax rate in fiscal year 2019 and onwards. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We\\'re expecting Q2 revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion. The midpoint corresponds to core revenue growth of 4.25% on a difficult compare as Q2 of last year saw core revenue growth of 8.7%. Comparing guidance to the just finished Q1, Q1 fiscal year 2018\\'s 9.7% core revenue growth benefited from an easier compare, in part due to the date of the 2017 Lunar New Year and a $20 million to $25 million carryover from Q4 2017 when we saw extended order to revenue conversions related to higher European and mass spec demand. Conversely, Q2 fiscal year 2018 projected 4.25% reflects the expected impact of the 2018 Lunar New Year in addition to a tough compare. As for EPS, we expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.61 to $0.63, a 7% year-over-year increase at midpoint. Thank you. So, Mike, as you sort of look at the pacing, particularly in chemical and energy, and maybe some of the cyclically sensitive markets and how things have kind of played out so far and the momentum maybe you saw in January, I guess how are you thinking about the duration of some of this upswing? And how do you tease out kind of what\\'s underlying cyclical and what maybe is, you either via product cycle or share or renewed focus kind of growing just above market? Yeah. So, thanks, Ross. Great question. I can see you\\'re still on your game after being away for a bit. So, let me start with the latter part of your question, which is I think what you\\'ve got going on here is a really nice situation in terms of both improving market conditions at the same point in time where we\\'ve been introducing some pretty compelling new offerings, whether being gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and then spectroscopy portfolio as well, and ACG. All these products are playing into an improved market environment for our chemical and energy. So, I don\\'t think we\\'re just keeping pace with the market in terms of our performance in the chemical and energy with these double-digit growth rates we\\'ve seen. I think we\\'re also obviously picking up some share as well. But it is a nice situation to be in in terms of both strength of portfolio and improved market conditions. Ross, I\\'ve kind of given up the idea of any kind of long-term view of these markets having been burned in the past on that. So, what we\\'ve been saying is, the positive momentum is there. I have a hard time, sometimes, with that word. But for next quarter or two, we have pretty good line of sight in that business. We would expect to maintain the momentum we have been seeing in the chemical and energy space. And I think what\\'s been different over the last quarter is, we\\'re seeing the growth across all three segments now that are investing in CapEx both on the expiration now in addition to what have been growth in the chemical side as well as refining. So, again, I think the outlook we kind of thought about relative to our guidance is in the next quarter or so. And we\\'ll kind of keep an eye on it as we go forward. And maybe just on the balance sheet, obviously, with the tax reform formalized, you now have quite a bit of access to some of that trapped cash historically. So, how should we think about your willingness to maybe do something slightly larger on the deal size? I mean, you\\'ve obviously executed fantastically well. You\\'ve kind of earned the right to maybe do something bigger or what you want. So, I guess, one, how should we think about that improved access to cash and your priorities there? And then secondarily, do you think the business can sort of take on maybe a larger and then very small tuck-in or technology deal, which is what you\\'ve done maybe over the last 12, 24 months? Yeah, happy to answer that question, Ross. I\\'ll leave the timing of when we think we may be able to get access to the overseas cash. I think we\\'re still working through that right now. But what I can share with you fairly confidently is both are thinking about these, the cash and then I\\'ll get into your question specifically relative to M&A. So, when we think about, as you probably gather from Didier\\'s remarks that the tax reform is a positive for Agilent in terms of the access to overseas cash both on, if you will, the one-time repatriation of the cash that has been trapped, but also just an ongoing cash flow advantage back to Agilent in the U.S., but we\\'re in no rush here. We\\'re going to be disciplined with how we use the cash. The priority will remain M&A and capital expenditures, which is really to invest in the business. And as you\\'ve heard me talk before, we remain committed to this balanced capital allocation policy. Now, specific to the questions around M&A, I do really appreciate your feedback. I actually believe that we have built up the capability and have now a track record of delivering on the yields we have done. So, I appreciate that feedback. And our primary focus has been on bolt-ons as you know, where the prices for the deal for Agilent have been in the several million to several hundred million dollar range. But right now, as I had mentioned before, we\\'re open to larger acquisitions but they still have to align with our long-term strategic intent, gaining more growth and earnings expansion for the company. And so, while we don\\'t have a predetermined number, we\\'re going to continue to be disciplined and selective. But I do believe the company is in a position that it could consider something larger than we have done in the past, both in terms of based on the operational results we\\'ve delivered as a company, but with inside the company we have really grown these muscles and really know how to make these things work with inside the company. Hey, thanks. Mike, I want to dig into the pharma numbers here. Nice recovery. Obviously, there was a fair amount of noise coming out of last quarter around some of the deferred revenues in Europe and the replacement cycle, and the NASD lumpiness. So, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the pickup in pharma, how much of that you think is just catch-up from last quarter versus sustainable acceleration here? Yeah. So, thanks, Tycho. And as you may recall from our last earnings announcement, there\\'s one area of concern I\\'d picked up in the call was, hey, is there something going on with Agilent\\'s pharma business? And at that point in time, we described the situation where we had a very strong incoming order rate, but there many of them were longer lead-time products from an order to a revenue standpoint. And that\\'s exactly what happened. We guided for growth in pharma. I think there was a lot of questions about whether or not that actually would occur after coming off a 5% decline in Q4 2017. And the quarter developed exactly as we had thought. So, what I would tell you is that we have roughly $20 million to $25 million of revenue that was basically in backlog in Q4 that we shipped them, most of it, in this first quarter. So, I think we\\'re right on our view of the overall growth for pharma for us, which is in the mid single-digit. So, I wouldn\\'t want to imply that there\\'s an acceleration of growth, but I think we continue to be very confident in our ability to make the numbers we committed to. And we saw both strength in biopharma and the small molecule side of pharma for us. So, we really were pleased with the numbers we put up in the first quarter in pharma. Okay. And then on DGG, I know you had a tough comp there. It did decelerate a little bit sequentially. Anything to call out there? Still up year-over-year, but just wondering if there\\'s anything from an end-market perspective you can call out for DGG. Yes. So, yeah, you\\'re right, Tycho, that we had another strong quarter on the top line growth with 8% growth. And we\\'re very pleased with that. We saw very strong growth from our pathology and our companion diagnostics business from a margin perspective. We have five divisions, and the mix continues from  quarter-to-quarter. So, the long-term view is still intact and we were actually expecting to be in this level. So, there\\'s nothing from the market perspective that impacted our performance. Okay. And if I could just ask one last one on Lasergen, that\\'s coming up in terms of you guys making a decision. Anything you can tell us at this point or do we have to wait couple of weeks here? Yeah. So, what I would share with the audience – thanks for the question, Tycho. We continue to be very pleased with the progress that Lasergen is making on the program. And as you may know that we have a pre-negotiated deal structure, which would allow us to exercise a call option in March. And I think that\\'s probably all I\\'m going to say at this point in time beyond the fact that the time of the exercise does fall in the period covered by our 10-Q. And if there would be an exercise, you would note that it\\'d be in the 10-Q. And just as a reminder, we\\'re thinking about Lasergen along the lines of any other acquisition. So, it\\'s not been considered in how we guided for the rest of the year. But, again, we continue to be quite pleased with how the program has been progressing. So, you have a great cadence of new products coming to market. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense for how much that was contributing to growth in the quarter and within that, maybe an update on the Ultivo cycle and how things are going. So, I\\'ll take the first part of that and then I know Patrick would just love to talk about what\\'s going on with Ultivo. That\\'s really a tough question for us to answer, and I\\'m not trying to dodge the question. We don\\'t really have a quantitation along those lines. I would just say it\\'s part of the story. We know that – if you\\'ve been noticing the growth rates of Agilent over the last three-plus years, the growth rates are accelerating. And what\\'s been going on at the same point in time is our cadence of new product introductions has also been accelerating, because in the earlier phases of what we were calling then the new Agilent, we\\'re basically redoing a lot of our product roadmaps. And now, we\\'ve got them redone and we\\'re actually executing and delivering. So, I\\'d say it\\'s a major contributor, but I really can\\'t provide a level of quantitation on that. Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. So, on the Ultivo product, and to what Mike said, all these new products drive a lot of good momentum for us in our end markets. And if you take Ultivo, for example, which we started shipping last quarter, and I\\'m happy to report that it\\'s well ahead of our own plan in terms of ramped volumes, and we\\'re really pleased with the acceptance that we own in our own field by the customers. We get excellent feedback from the first installations out there, and it\\'s driving a lot of excitement about our product portfolio. So, it\\'s not only driving the Ultivo volume itself, it\\'s also driving a lot of collateral business for us in the LC/MS business. And I think this pipeline of new products that we have launched over the last two years is a major contribution for us, in our trajectory right now, we\\'re taking market share. And, Patrick, if I remember our conversation from this morning, it\\'s both in our expectations relative to unit growth as well as price per unit. So... Great. And then in chemical and energy, I was wondering if you could just give us an update in terms of what\\'s built in the guidance for 2018. Obviously, the macro picture continues to be robust. In 2Q, is there anything Lunar New Year-wise that we need to consider there? Just, thanks, any feedback would be great. Yeah. Let me make a few comments here. So, there is somewhat of a Lunar New Year. And I told Didier earlier, so I\\'d hope at one point in time one quarter I won\\'t have to talk. Every year, we seem to talk about Lunar New Year, but this is a reminder for the audience. What happened here is the way the Lunar New Year fell this year, many customers actually wanted shipments of products before they left for the holiday. So, we had some revenues that we thought were going to be in the second quarter that actually showed up in China in the first quarter. On the chemical energy, I wouldn\\'t say that\\'s material at the company level, however, but there\\'s a portion of the business that\\'s impacted. We think about the overall guide for the year, I think we\\'re probably – if you think about our guide, the midpoint of 5.5%, I think you could probably put us 6%, 6-plus-percent, 6%, 6.5% for chemical and energy. And, again, we\\'re expecting a continuation of the momentum, albeit we\\'re starting to go into a period of tough compares, because, as I mentioned in my call, it\\'s now been four quarters in a row of double-digit growth. And now I have to compare my growth against those hot numbers. But, again, the market environment continues to be positive in chemical and energy, and we\\'re kind of in the 6-ish range for the year. Hey, guys. Two questions for you. First, Mike, just was wondering if you could comment at all about the kind of pricing and promotional environment of late in some of your analytical instruments. Are you seeing any changes as it relates to pricing either from some raw material inflation or just from a competitive standpoint? And then I guess secondly, it kind of goes along with that. You made the comment that you feel like you\\'re outgrowing the overall market. Just was wondering, is there any particular areas of notable strength that you feel like you\\'re really outgrowing the market as it relates to the different product categories you\\'re in? Yeah, sure. Happy to address both questions. So, there\\'s been a lot of talk about the inflation, inflationary concerns. And it\\'s put a drag on the market, as you know, at the time of release, introduced a level of volatility in the market we haven\\'t seen for a while, but we\\'re not seeing that in our market. So, of course, the markets are very competitive. There\\'re certain competitors who tend to focus more on price than we do. But, Patrick, I think it\\'s pretty fair to say that we\\'re really not seeing a lot of real changes in discounting practices or pricing structures in the marketplace. And that\\'s why I\\'d actually asked – I pointed out earlier, for example, in our new product category that we just introduced, we\\'re actually doing better on the ASP side than we had actually anticipated. So, we\\'re feeling pretty comfortable about where the price points are. And, yes, yes, sorry. Yeah. So, in terms of market share, we look at the macro numbers and said okay, we know our growth rate\\'s higher than our peers, and then we kind of peer into the different product categories. I think we have a good handle, particularly on our LSAG instrument side because we\\'re able to compare ourselves through and externally, if you will, an independent source of data, ALDA. And we can see where our market shares are really picking up. And I think it kind of spilled out a bit in my narrative, but mass spec was strong double-digit growth; chromatography, spectroscopy, these are places where really we can say confidently we\\'re picking up share relative to the competition. But at the same point in time, even though we don\\'t have the same stats, we know in DGG, on the pathology side we continue to pick up share growing there. So, it\\'s been a sort of a broad-based story, but in particular we can talk with a lot of confidence because we have external data around our instruments. Thanks for taking my question. So, first one is maybe for Patrick or Mike. Just trying to understand what was the really strong in mass spec area in LSAG? So, what sort of products that are driving the growth here and what end markets? And if Patrick could give those details. And if you could also help me understand how much of that was revenue recognition from the last quarter and how much of that was the contribution into this quarter. And then I\\'ve a follow up. Yeah, I\\'ll kick it off. So, when you look at the LC/MS space, we definitely have seen the strongest growth in the Quadrupole space, meaning single-quarter and triple-quarter. And a lot of that was driven by the product launches we made last year at ASMS. We introduced the Ultivo, we also introduced a new single-quad product, both drive healthy growth for us in LC/MS. And in terms of growth that drove in revenues in Q1, yes, some of it was driven by the strong order growth we had in Q4 last year, but we see a continued momentum behind these products. So, I\\'m not concerned on the outlook of these products. The funnel looks pretty healthy. When you look at the end-market space, as Mike mentioned that pharma is doing very well for us in the LC/MS, but we also see it in Applied Markets like in food analysis where this product is heavily used. Okay. That\\'s very helpful. Thanks. And then a second question that I have is, we saw a large set of promotions that were running on both instruments and consumables in the LC business. The consumables are no surprise to me, but instrument discounts were intriguing at the end of first quarter where it seemed like the benefit looks to land in fiscal second quarter. Hoping to see if you can elaborate something on that. And essentially if there are drivers, what were the drivers of those promotions? And if there was any benefit in 1Q from that and how should we think about the second quarter fiscal in light of those promotions? Yeah, Puneet. Thanks for that insightful question. And this is a general statement. We tend to run promotions on a regular basis. And this is part of our mix when we\\'re trying to target certain areas or certain geographies or certain market segments. And then, we have gone down a path of promoting, if you will, the entire solution and not just picking an element of a particular purchase that a customer would be interested in. So, I think it may be a specific question about, maybe you can comment specifically, Patrick, about what\\'s going on in the liquid chromatography area between you and Mark on the column side. Yes. Yeah, I think what we\\'re really doing here is, we are leveraging the strength of both instrument and the aftermarket business in the consumables. When we launched last year the Infinity brand LC consumables as well, we thought it\\'s also now a product that really put some stronger campaigns behind it, again, as Mike said, this is nothing unusual. We do this really to extend our market region, we try to reach customers which potentially have not considered Agilent in the past, like at the lower end of the portfolio is what you have seen there. So, it\\'s not a strong discounting account across the entire portfolio. We\\'re really trying to target also entry-level systems and customers who want to benefit from the Agilent performance and quality of our instruments and aftermarket solutions that have not considered us today. And this was part of that promotion you probably referred to. Yeah, I mean, the strategy here is really to get new incremental growth, new customers, not sell to existing customers at a lower price point. I want to save Valentine\\'s Day for other people, but regarding where you are in the stage of your operating margin expansion, can you detail some of the efforts ahead and are you in inning one or two or three of that margin expansion program? And then secondly, regarding I know CrossLab has been part of your strategy to take share. What\\'s your visibility? Is this the multiyear share gain still ahead for you? Yeah, what I\\'m going to do is, I\\'ll take – by the way, thanks for the comments, Paul. I\\'m going to go ahead and take the first question. And Mark, if you could pick up the second question on ACG\\'s longer term outlook. So, in terms of the margin expansion, we were really just delighted to see the 130 basis points of improvement in Q1. And as you may recall, we had a bogey we had put out last year to hit 22%. And I told us, listen, that\\'s just a milestone along a longer journey of continued margin improvement. So, fundamentally, we think that we can continue to improve operating margins about a 35% incremental moving forward. And then to your question, we have some real specific programs lined up. So, I mentioned in my remarks about our Agile Agilent program and we\\'re still finding ways to simplify the company, streamline the company. A lot of the focus now is in our back office operations as well as how we handle the incoming orders from customers. We have still a very manual process. And we think that we can really automate that, and we have what we call a touchless transaction initiative inside the company. And, again, I think it leads to more seamless customer experience and increases our velocity of transactions we handle. And we don\\'t have to continue to add people at the same rate as revenue. So that\\'s one area of focus for example. The second area, and I think is actually much more significant in terms of P&L impact is the initiatives that we have underway in our order fulfillment organization. So, the evolution of that was phase one was really about moving products into lower cost geographies . And now phase two is really heavily focused on three aspects, which is, one, is focusing on the material costs for the company which last time I looked was well over $900 million of purchases. We\\'re in the midst of a major transformation of our procurement organization and how we engage and work with suppliers. And it\\'s already starting to translate into some lower costs, while maintaining – or in some cases, even improving quality. We have a major initiative of value engineering, where we basically use our engineering prowess to reengineer certain components for lower cost while sustaining improvement of performance of the product. And the last area is logistics where we continue to find ways to lower cost. And you may have caught a recent announcement, if you follow the local news in Tennessee where we have made a major move to insource logistics from FedEx in Tennessee. So that will also be one more example of things we\\'re doing in the supply chain to lower cost. And then the third thing I would just say is, in general, across the entire company we have this continuous process improvement mindset where we continue to find ways to streamline what we do to make it more efficient and make people\\'s work inside the company more enjoyable while also having the great benefit of doing a better job for our customers, and obviously the P&L. So, I think those things are sustainable. I think we\\'re still in middle innings, if you will, on this. We haven\\'t run out of ideas and we think we continue to sustain this performance. Mark, in terms of sustaining performance, perhaps you can share with Paul and the audience your thoughts about the long-term growth prospects for ACG. Thanks, Mike, and thanks Paul for the question. Obviously, we\\'re very pleased with our ongoing very consistent high single-digit growth performance. And we\\'re confident in our ability to grow. And it\\'s not just from a market share gain perspective, it\\'s also bigger account penetration into our current accounts and also portfolio expansion. And Mike alluded to this at the beginning of the call, what\\'s fundamentally been a growth driver for us. And we saw accelerating growth throughout the remainder of 2017 and now into 2018 has been our consumables portfolio. This started well over a couple years back. And there\\'s never going to be a single big product area inside our consumables business that that\\'ll drive top line, but over the course of FY 2017 we added over 1,000 new products into our portfolio. And as you probably can guess, those then get pushed through our channels, our expanded e-channel reach and then ultimately they have long-term annuity streams that in many cases last over a decade. So, I\\'d say across the board, if we look at it from our enterprise business, our instruments service business and our consumables business, we continue to see great opportunity to continue to grow across those dimensions that I just mentioned. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. You can be mine. There you go. So, I\\'m just curious about sort of like the pacing. I mean, obviously you gave guidance in mid-November, and then I think we all were sort of feeling a little bit conservative on – I think we all assume are being a little bit conservative, but I think the quarter\\'s results were a little bit above and beyond certainly what even the most bullish people were thinking. So, what was sort of happening in the pacing in December/January? Was it bigger budget flush than normal, just better order trends? I mean, was there any sort of inflection that you saw in terms of the outlook? Yeah. Great question, Derik. And I think what we saw was, overall, if you look at the strength which really surprised us was, we saw stronger than forecast growth in academia and government. We weren\\'t expecting that kind of number, 11%. Chemical engineering we knew was going to be good, but we didn\\'t think it was going to be that good. And in Europe, we knew it would be good, but not that good. So, I think things just came in stronger than we forecast. The year-end budgets were there. So, we had a lot of order strength coming into the calendar year. And we were able to turn a lot of that into revenue in the first quarter. The one that we hadn\\'t anticipated in addition to those points I just made relative to the market environment was, customer behavior in China, which is, what we had was a timing issue or we had some Q2 revenue pull in from the Lunar New Year because typically customers want their products, says, ah, Lunar New Year, we\\'ll deal with this after we come back. But for some reason, this year, which I can\\'t really explain, they were looking for products to be taken earlier. So, we actually had more revenue in China. I mean, we had upper teens growth in China for the quarter. We think China\\'s still going to be a source of growth, high single digits, maybe 10-ish for the year, but it won\\'t grow upper teens like it did in Q1. So, I think of all the things that one I think we hadn\\'t anticipated from a standpoint of different customer behavior in China, although we didn\\'t think the budget would be as strong as well in certain market segments. So, it was a quarter where everything came together very, very nicely. And we\\'re happy with the numbers. Okay. So then China pull forward, and then maybe a little bit from the Easter holiday, although and for the timing of that that\\'s sort of the basis for the 4.25% core guide for the next quarter? Yeah. And Didier, I forget as to how much we had estimated might have been pulled in from the China? So, yeah, about $10 million we have pulled in and then we\\'ll have another $10 million feed because of the Chinese New Year in Q2. Okay. Thank you. That\\'s very helpful. Just one other follow-up question. This is actually another China question. I noticed on your slide deck you launched this Value line of consumables for China. And just can you talk a little bit more about that? Maybe I just missed it. I wasn\\'t familiar with that as something going on and sort of talk about that and is that something that\\'s applicable more globally? Yeah, I think I\\'ll have Mark make some comments here. So, this is relatively your closed study of the company, because it\\'s relatively new introduction for the company. So, Mark, why don\\'t you share with Derik your thoughts about what\\'s going on in China and whether or not this model may play out in other geographies. Hi, Derik, Mark. As far as China is concerned, we\\'ve gone on record that we wanted to look specifically at China\\'s marketplace, look at a portfolio that\\'s fine-tuned to China. And our Value line offering in China was to address customers who are still looking for higher quality, but not quite as much capability in our supplies in chemistries business. And we\\'re obviously very pleased with the initial results of this and extending that portfolio. At this juncture, we certainly see the opportunity to move this to other areas where we could see the same value proposition, whether it be parts of Southeast Asia or India. We\\'re not ready quite to pull the trigger on that, but our primary focus is China, just because of the enormous market opportunity there. But that was the intent with this Value line is, same quality they expect from Agilent that at a performance that\\'s relative to the tests they\\'re trying to accomplish there. And, Derik, I would just add. We don\\'t see this as cannibalizing our current business, we actually see it as an addition. I think there was some concern, oh, we\\'ve introduced new product, are we going to cannibalize our own business? This is type of segment we\\'re not able to address right now. So, we\\'re pretty excited about this. Mike, just go ahead and reiterate that comment, it really has been a bolt-on to our current business in China. Great, thanks. Maybe one for you Mike. On Intuvo, has your view changed at all on that adoption curve trending, probably the sharpest acceleration hitting maybe three years into the launch? And then, now that we\\'re 18 months into the launch, are you seeing more customers come back with multisystem orders? Yeah, absolutely. So, speaking for Patrick, I\\'ll jump right on this one, which was, we are starting to see repeat orders and multiunit purchases of Intuvo GC, particularly in high throughput applications where they\\'re also using mass spec. So, it\\'s playing out just as we thought it would. But I will tell you it takes the customer some time to understand exactly what it is we\\'ve delivered to the marketplace. I can just share with you firsthand, last week I was in India and I sat in on a seminar with some of our key VIP customers who are very knowledgeable in gas chromatography and they had a lot of questions and there had been some hesitation because it was so new, but once they had opportunity to really understand it and see it, really see how unique the innovation here is. And, in fact, one of the customers said, listen, gas chromatography has been sort of the same way for decades, this is really quite something different and you really have changed the thinking about innovation. It really is easy to use. So, customers who have it have been really pleased, and we\\'re now starting to see repeat buys and multi buys, so, that ramp rate is starting to occur. Okay. And then how should we be thinking about potential larger scale pharma M&As impacting? I mean, I assume there would be a pause in the instrument purchases, but could that actually be an opportunity on ACG to accelerate growth just with the operations in productivity side? That\\'s exactly the answer. You\\'ve got it. So, we\\'ve been through these kind of cycles before, but we\\'re actually – if, in fact, they would occur, but the company is in such a different position than it was during some of the other bigger consolidations we\\'ve seen in the past. So, yeah, you would have a pause on new instrument purchases. At the same point in time, it\\'ll create new opportunities for us in the ACG business as it relates to both enterprise services, relocation, also refurbished business units. We\\'ll probably get very actively involved in taking some of the excess equipment that customers may have and taking it back into Agilent and redeploy in other set market segments. So, we\\'re not overly concerned about this. And we\\'ve also found historically when there\\'s been merger and acquisition where they tend to want to consolidate or put more spends on to a fewer vendors, it plays to our strength, really reliable equipment that has high performance and really has a cost of ownership advantage to them. So, I think the ACG story is one thing that really allows us to say, if this would occur, it\\'ll be mitigated by some of the change we\\'ve made in terms of the company\\'s portfolio and capabilities we offer to the marketplace. Mike, a question about the government and academic segment. I mean, two straight quarters of double-digit growth. Could you give us a sense of how that looks geographically and what areas you think you\\'re gaining share and if it\\'s something you changed commercially that might be contributing to that? Yeah. So, the funding environment has been improved in Europe and has remained strong in China. So, geographically, we\\'re pointing to Europe and China as the source of strength for academia and government. But your intuition was spot-on, which is we\\'ve really fundamentally changed the commercial approach to this marketplace. And that\\'s why it is always hard to predict market share gains when you\\'re doing your guide and your forecasts. But I think that\\'s one of the reasons why we\\'re seeing such strong growth because what we\\'ve done is we fundamentally have – we reorganized our academia and government channel. And I think that would be in quotes because a couple years ago, it was a very fragmented approach to these university and government market. Now we have one focus channel backed up by a company-wide academia program supported by a number of initiatives such as our Thought Leader Awards and other access programs we had with our Agilent Labs. So, this combination of a new go to customer model in academia and government backed up by some new company level programs I think is starting to yield dividends. Super. And then one more. In terms of the Nucleic Acid Solutions facility expansion, just want to check and see if there\\'s many change in the timeline. And when do you plan to start the validation process? And how long does that take? Great question. It\\'s actually very timely, as we just had a review on that just a few hours ago. So, Jacob, if you can remember the details perhaps you can handle that question. Yeah, absolutely. And we are pleased to report that we continued to move forward according to our expectations meaning that our validation efforts will start in early next year and then continue. We actually believe it will take quite a while. This is a unique setup we have. So, validation will take a while to get through. It\\'s not something that happens within a few months, but over a period of time. And we do believe that would be all done by end of next fiscal year. And then start to see revenue into 2020, sometime in 2020. Hopefully a little bit in 2019 too. But we\\'re really feeling happy about where we are. We just had a very detailed review of the production progress. We\\'re pretty much almost done the construction side of the production. Capabilities are bringing on and then we\\'ll start moving into, as Jacob mentioned, validation. Really strong Q1 in bumping up guidance pretty significantly for the full year, despite comps getting a bit tougher as you talked about. Can you confirm that your overall guidance philosophy hasn\\'t changed? I guess, what I\\'m getting at is, if end markets continue to hold up as expected, do you still feel there\\'s plenty of room for you to do better than your revised guidance as has been the case for the past couple Q1s? Yeah. Thanks for the recap of the guide. And you\\'re exactly right. There\\'s been no change in our thinking about how we guide the company. And I tried to call that out in my script, and I think I used the word we\\'ll continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look. And we stand ready to raise our full-year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. And that\\'s what we\\'d said for example the Q4 of 2017. And that\\'s exactly what we\\'ve done here in this first quarter. Excellent. And then maybe one on cell analysis. You\\'ve called out cell analysis as a key growth driver over at least the past few quarters. How much annual revenue do you have in this area now including the recent Luxcel acquisition? And is this business still growing 15% to 20%, which I think is what you called out around the acquisition of Seahorse? Yeah. We don\\'t report directly the specific numbers around the vision of the company. But I think you can probably gauge the relative size if you can go back and look at what we said at the time of the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. And it is growing in the ranges you just described. Looking at the final market, we\\'ve heard about massive job cuts at Teva. What\\'s your opinion on the overall help of generics market? And what\\'s your revenue exposure to these customers, and Teva, specifically? And then could you break out what you saw in recurring pharma revenue versus instrument? Yeah, sure. Happy to address a number of points that you\\'ve asked about. So, first of all, I can just share with you, I think Teva is a company-specific challenge, not an indication of what\\'s happening in the macro market environment. And I mentioned earlier that I\\'d been in India, and, of course, the generic industry is quite important in the Indian marketplace. And I was with a number of executives from generic pharma companies, and they\\'re really excited about where things are going. I think there\\'s something like $50 billion worth of new drugs coming off of patents in the next two years, on the small molecule side. They\\'re making a lot of investments in biosimilar. So, that marketplace is very healthy. And I think Teva is going through some of its own internal challenges, but I wouldn\\'t say that\\'s indicative of the overall marketplace. They are a customer of ours, but I think it\\'s not material at the company level in terms of the business volume there. And then I believe the instrument aftermarket ratios are fairly dissimilar in pharma as they are in the rest of the company, maybe – yeah, yeah, which is probably in the range of 55% or so aftermarket, 45% upfront. Hope that helps. Hey, Mike. I think you guys got the high points here, so, maybe just one for me on the segment margins. LSAG was up pretty nicely in the quarter. Do you think you\\'ll continue to stay at that 100 bps to 200 bps range, just given what seems like there\\'s some good leverage potential there. And then, I guess on the flipside, where do we think about DGG margins going, just given the step down for the quarter? Yeah. So, I\\'ll make some initial comments and then invite Patrick and Jacob into the discussion. So, I just saw exceptional performance in LSAG with 11% growth. That really shows you when we get to top line, we get a lot of leverage in the margins there. And as we mentioned earlier, we think the pricing is holding up. So, we\\'re pretty confident about the margin going forward. I don\\'t think we can expect that level of improvement every quarter, would be my guess, Patrick. You\\'ll not see the same level of improvement for sure. But, again, to your point, is what we definitely see is that the new products have better gross margins. They are very competitive in pricing, which is, again, driving a lot of it. And when the volume picks up, as we have seen the last quarter, then you get these exceptional results. Right. I think it also shows our business model side of the company. Hey, when volume picks up, we don\\'t go on a spending spree here. And that\\'s how we can get the margin expansion. And I think it\\'s important, maybe as we shift over to DGG, is, there\\'s a lot of puts and takes each quarter in DGG given just the nature of the business. And so, again, we\\'ve had a great run in terms of margin expansion and we think we\\'re going to be in a solid position as we begin exit 2018. But perhaps maybe just a little bit more insight in terms of how you think about where you are on the margins, Jacob. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And as mentioned before, we came in low. We always do that in Q1 since we have a strong run rate business and very dependent on the number of days in the quarter. But at the same time, we have a relatively high fixed cost space. This is the impact you will have in Q1. And we have that basically every year. And then there is, on top of that, some mix that can move from one quarter to the other. And that is really what you have seen in this quarter, but overall came in as expected. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to happen the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Thank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of the management team here in Agilent, we\\'d like to thank you all for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. Thanks, again.

Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website. Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\\'s call. Before I discuss the Q2 financial highlights with you, I\\'d like to first welcome Jacob Thaysen and Sam Raha to the first earnings call in their new roles. Most of you know Jacob from his former role as the President of Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. He now is transitioned into a new role as the President of our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. Sam is replacing Jacob as the new President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group. Sam, as you may recall, rejoined Agilent a year ago as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Both Jacob and Sam have extensive backgrounds in life sciences, wide industry knowledge and connections. Both are highly experienced at building and leading large organizations. Agilent is fortunate to have a deep leadership bench to draw upon to fill these two roles. Now let me turn to our Q2 financial performance. I can report that the Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Our momentum continues. Our core revenue growth of 4.3% is at the midpoint of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.65 exceeded our expectations and is above the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS is up 12% from a year ago. We delivered adjusted operating margin of 21.9%. On a currency adjusted basis, this is our 13th quarter in a row of improving operating margins. After two strong quarters to start the year, our core growth now stands at 7% with adjusted operating margin of 22.2% and adjusted EPS of 19%. I\\'m making some references to our first half results as Lunar New Year had a material impact on the timing of our reported revenues. In Q1, our Chinese customers requested deliveries earlier than anticipated. As a reminder, this pulled in approximately $10 million of revenue from Q2 into our first quarter. In Q2, we also estimate that the reduced number of selling days due to Lunar New Year had a negative impact of close to $10 million on our ACG annuity business. These two factors reduced Q2\\'s reported company growth by 2 percentage points. Back to our Q2 results and turning to our end markets. Pharma, our largest business, continued a strong showing with 8% growth. Strength in mass spectrometry, consumables, services and genomics led the results. Growth was strong in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives. Our chemical and energy market revenues grew 5%, in line with our expectations and against a difficult compare of 14% growth last year. The global chemical and energy market environment remains favorable although we noted a slight pause among our U.S. customer base, which may be attributable to some concerns about trade policies. We grew 2% in academia and government, driven primarily by strength in LC/MS, cell analysis and our CrossLab services and consumables business. Diagnostics and clinical grew 3%, led by strength on our reagent partnership and genomics business and offset continued weakness in the U.S. pain management market. Food revenue was down 1%, reflecting initial impact of the Chinese government reorganization of the food safety ministries. On March 21, the Chinese government announced the creation of the National Market Supervision Administration, NMSA, consolidating many previously independent agencies, such as AQSIQ, SFDA and SAIC into one market supervisory agency. This has resulted in a temporary slowing of new instrument purchases as ministries are being consolidated and decision makers are being clarified. We expect the reorganization will take as long as 1 year to be completely finished, with expected slowdown of six to nine months in new instrument purchases. Environmental and forensics grew 2%, driven by strong gains in our global forensics business. In March, the Chinese government also announced some changes to the structure of the environmental ministries. These changes, however, are not as large as those for the food market ministries. While we did see some slowdown in new instrument purchases, we expect business to return to higher levels of growth in the next quarter or 2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe grew strongly with high single-digit growth. China was flat in Q2 due to the timing impact of Lunar New Year and the recently announced changes to the government food and environmental ministry agencies. For the half, our China team delivered a strong 9% core growth. Now I\\'ll cover some of the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 3%. Growth in chemical and energy remained robust, offset in the weakness in the food testing market. From a product perspective, we saw strength in LC/MS, cell analysis and ICP-MS. Our new LC/MS, Ultivo, continues to be well received by the market and performed ahead of our targets. On the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. Agilent is known as an innovator in capillary-electrophoresis-based instrumentation, and this acquisition will add complementary technologies to our portfolio. The regulatory review is underway. After the quarter end, we also now plan to acquire Genohm, which closed today. Genohm is a developer of highly differentiated, on-premise and cloud-based software solution for laboratory management. The Genohm team would join Agilent as part of our LSAG group. Customers are looking to do more with their data. By integrating Genohm\\'s platform into our OpenLAB portfolio, Agilent and its OpenLAB value proposition encompass the management of all the context and content in the lab. We continue to build out our cell analysis business. In collaboration with BioTek Instruments, we announced a new integrated solution that combines cellular metabolic balances and imaging technologies. This collaboration provides new capabilities to our Agilent Seahorse analyzers, which help biologists measure cell activity in real time. Agilent CrossLab Group continued its consistent, outstanding performance with 7% core revenue growth, gains across our major end markets led by double-digit growth in pharma and academia and government. Performance was balanced across consumables and services. China delivered double-digit growth, and all other geographies grew in mid- to high single digits. During the quarter, we made progress on our mission to prove both the science and the economics of our customers\\' laboratories. We introduced an innovative and extremely stable new GC column that is receiving a very positive response from customers. ACG service has expanded to Agilent-enabled services pilot to include additional platforms across Agilent. The pilot is aimed at improving the customer onboarding experience by shortening their time to value after they purchase our solutions. We also opened a new Global Solution Development Center in Singapore to meet the increasing demand for integrated end-to-end solutions. Our online capabilities continue to gain momentum. Our China online business has seen double-digit growth since the beginning of the year. And our China WeChat services program has attracted more than 13,000 active customers since its roll-out at the end of last year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered core revenue growth of 4%, as expected, led by strength in our genomics business. On the innovation front, we introduced several new products this quarter. Our launch of HRP Magenta for the Dako Omnis, Agilent\\'s flagship instrument for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, allows pathologists to more easily visualize cancer in skin and lung tissues. We continue to expand our portfolio of in situ hybridization probes with the release of 7 new probes for Omnis to maximize our differentiation in automated ISH staining. On the genomics side, we announced -- we enhanced our industry-leading target enrichment portfolio for next-gen sequencing. Our recent introduction of the SureSelect All Exon V7 is being well received by customers as it improves both performance and cost effectiveness. On the genomics informatics front, we released a new module for the Alissa Clinical Informatics Platform. This new module further simplifies informatics processes and accelerate timed results for our customers. We continue to invest for future growth. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining shares of Lasergen and close the acquisition on May 7. As many of you may recall, we made an initial investment in Lasergen in 2016 for a 48% ownership stake. This acquisition brings into Agilent a powerful sequencing chemistry and a world-class group of scientists and engineers dedicated to bringing our integrated clinical workflow solution for molecular diagnostics to the market. We are very excited to have the Lasergen scientists and engineers on the One Agilent team. We expect to invest about $35 million per year to deliver our molecular clinical workflow solution to the market in 2020. Now let me provide a few remarks on where we are in our journey at Agilent and our outlook for the rest of the year. The Agilent team continues to execute, and our momentum remains. We are right where we want to be for the first six months of the year. We delivered strong growth while improving operating margins and deploying our capital on a balanced manner. Once again, our EPS growth is in the double digits. Our R&D innovation engine continues to strengthen our portfolio. We\\'re all excited of the new capabilities through M&A. We believe this combination of organic growth-driven investments and complementary M&A, together with our execution capabilities, will deliver continued strong growth relative to the market. For the past three years, our focus has been on building the company\\'s foundation, a foundation that will leverage the One Agilent company culture, innovation and execution capabilities to generate above-market growth and earnings expansion. Our platform for top line and earnings growth is now in place. We are delivering. When we\\'re rebuilding the company, I also want to focus on making the company more agile and responsive to our market environment. Looking forward, we continue to proactively assess market forces and moving the agile manager to capture most promising opportunities. As you know, our two largest end markets are pharma and chemical and energy. Through the first half this year, our pharma performance has been above our expectations and we are raising our full year pharma outlook. Our full year guide for the chemical and energy market business remains unchanged. We expect a strong mid to high single digit growth. Geographically, we are bringing down our expected full year growth rates in China to about 7% as a result of the expected pause in businesses from the realignment -- realignments of the government agencies. At the same time, we remain confident in the strength of our European and Americas business and have raised our full year outlook for these geographies from the Q1 guide assumptions. While there are some end market and geographic give-and-take, our overall model remains intact. Following the significantly raised guidance last quarter, we are reaffirming our full year core growth guidance and earnings guidance, inclusive of currency headwinds and increase in our molecular clinical workflow offering. The Agilent team is confident, energized and excited about our future, our next phase of growth and delivery of results. We are looking forward to sharing more about what is behind this outlook in our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day. Thanks for being on the call and we look forward to answering your questions and seeing you in June. I will now hand off the call to Didier, who will share more insights on our Q2 financials and updated outlook. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered another strong performance this quarter and year-to-date. For the quarter, our core revenue growth of 4.3% was in line with our guidance, and we over delivered on operating margin and earnings per share. Our core revenue growth would have been more than 1 percentage point higher if not for ICP-MS shipment delays and the recently announced reorganization of Chinese government ministries. Our adjusted operating margin of 21.9% was 40 basis points above the implied guidance, and EPS of $0.65 was $0.03 above. Further adjusting for currency, the operating margin was 22.4%, i.e. 30 basis points above last year and as highlighted by Mike, represented our 13th quarter of increased year-over-year operating margin. We delivered $303 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we bought back 674,000 shares of Agilent stock for a total of $46 million and paid $48 million in dividends. I\\'ll now cover the guidance of fiscal year 2018. We are maintaining our core revenue growth guidance of 5.5% even as we anticipate that the reorganization of Chinese government ministries may push out about $20 million of revenues into fiscal year \\'19. We are also maintaining our EPS guidance of $2.65 while absorbing $22 million or $0.06 for FX and our technology investments in Lasergen and Genohm. Regarding Lasergen, we forecast to spend $15 million this second half and about $35 million in both fiscal year \\'19 and fiscal year \\'20 when we plan to commercialize our solution. There is no change to our operating cash flow guidance of $1.05 billion and CapEx guidance of $200 million. I\\'ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.185 billion to $1.205 billion and EPS of $0.61 to $0.63. At midpoint, revenue will grow 4.3% on a core basis. Absolutely.  Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. The operating margin guide, it\\'s - for the year, it\\'s down about 20 bps. Is that FX and the diluted impact of the acquisitions, is that what\\'s going on there? Got it. And I think you already answered my question about what you\\'re going absorb in terms of Lasergen. But what are these other deals, the ATT, the - I\\'m sorry, the Advanced Analytical and the Genohm, going to add in terms of the top line for M&A contribution? Do they have significant revenues? Yes. Because it hasn\\'t closed, we have not included it at all in our guidance projections. We will only do that once it closes. Got it. And so I\\'m a little bit curious on the China comments. It\\'s -- none of the -- just having -- you guys are at the end of earnings season and none of your elder life sciences peers sort of commented, and it sounds like this happened late in March about the Chinese food reorg. I\\'m just sort of wondering, can you talk a little bit more about that and exactly what\\'s going on and why you think it\\'s going to take a year to sort of wind through the system? Yes, sure. As you may know, they have these two big annual sessions they call -- I won\\'t read out the full abbreviation, but the NPC, the National People\\'s Congress, and the CPPCC, which they had these two annual events. And after those events occurred, on March 21, they announced the reorganization of the ministries. And where we came of the estimate of about a year was based on our experience in 2014 and \\'15 when there was a similar reorganization within the CFDA and we saw a pause of six to nine months of business during that period of time. And we\\'re using that as a similar rule of thumb. It\\'s very consistent with the estimates on our teams. So - and I can remember we, on the earnings call at that time, are saying, listen, the businesses are not going away, but we know that there will be a pause at least on new instrument purchases as they work through all the changes. So that\\'s our - that\\'s a guideline. Of course, legacy will be shorter, but we wanted to be somewhat cautious on our outlook given our prior experience with the major, major changes such as this. The change on the environmental side is much less significant and should have a shorter-term impact. Hey, thanks. Maybe I\\'ll start with academic. You had a similar comp this quarter and the last quarter, obviously the results a little bit later. Is that just the timing dynamic? Or is there something else going on? Yes, Tycho, you hit it right on the head. It\\'s just the timing. That business can be a little bit more lumpy, but we\\'re actually positive on the overall funding of academia and government. So I wouldn\\'t over-read into that quarterly result. And of course, we also had the shortened period of business in China, which also affected that a bit as well in academia and government. And then chemical and energy, you called out the slight pause in the U.S. Can you maybe just talk about that dynamic and if trends have proved at all in May? Yes, thanks, Tycho. I mean, the numbers were solid. I mean, we had 5% growth off of a really difficult compare, but there\\'s some kind of noise in the system particularly in the U.S. Business is good, but it could have even been more robust. And I think there\\'s this -- as you know, business doesn\\'t like uncertainty. And there\\'s lots of uncertainty, what\\'s going to happen in terms of trade policies and tariffs. And so I just -- we thought it\\'s prudent to mention that it didn\\'t affect materially the results, but the noise is out there although we, as you can see in our guide, we still remain very confident of our ability to grow this year in chemical and energy. And I know we\\'re going to talk a bit about China today as well, but that\\'s one segment of the China market that is really, really strong. And we can expect goodwill there for years to come. But again, we just thought it was good to share with the audience what we\\'ve been hearing from some of our customers. And is it fair to say you\\'re not yet seeing meaningful benefits from Intuvo at this point in chemical and energy? Yes, it\\'s ramping, as we said. It\\'s part of the story there, but we still have a lot more runway with that product. Okay. And then last one on Lasergen. Are there milestones we should be thinking about on the development pathway here in terms of placing additional beta units? Or how do we think about the road map here for commercialization? Look, for some of the visibility  in the market in 2020, I\\'ll wait later on for that, Sam, right? Okay. Thank you. So just a quick follow-up on Lasergen there. Mike, is the $35 million in annual spend, is that all incremental or is some of that in the base? And then how does that impact how you\\'re thinking about the margin expansion trajectory for corporate Agilent in fiscal 2019 and 2020? Because that\\'s a material amount of spend versus what we would think of as a normal operating margin improvement cadence for the total company. Yes. We\\'ll give you some more detailed information in the analyst meeting in June. But I think it has been that our core business will continue to follow the incremental growth in terms of margin expansion you\\'ve seen over the prior years. So this is a dilutive acquisition for us, but we think we can carry this forward. And we\\'ll share all the details with you when we meet in June but -- and again, our core model of continuing to expand the operating margins with incrementals is intact. And then finally, just trying to think about how to size the China food safety exposure. Is it fair to think about your business in China being a mid-single digit grower until this normalizes? Or is it lower than that over the next, call it, six to nine month time frame? We\\'ve provided the outlook. The guidance is for 7%. We used to have 10% in the previous quarter guidance. So we are now at 7%. Good afternoon, guys. I just want to be clear on sort of the sequential headwinds, Q1 to Q2, and then sort of the jump-off from there because I think you said a couple of different things. So we had, obviously, the New Year shift. We had the day shift in the quarter, and then it seems like there was also something you said on ICP-MS. So just help us. Versus the original plan, what were the actual components of the delta that affected this Q? And it seems like the only thing coming out of this Q that\\'s updated new, other than maybe the developed markets are better, is sort of China net worse because of food. I just want to make sure I get the cadence and the components right. Yes, let me take that one, Ross. It\\'s -- you are absolutely correct. The Lunar New Year was -- impact was obviously already reflected in our guidance as well as the very tough compare. Remember that last year, we had 9% core revenue growth; and the year before, 8%; and also the fact that last year, we had $7 million of settlement with our -- within our DGG organization. What is new versus the previous guidance are the shipment delays on ICP-MS and the reorganization of the Chinese government ministries. So only those 2 factors, which take away about 1 percentage point of our growth, we have not included in our previous guidance. Got it. And in terms of risk factors both positive or negative to the 2H guide, I mean, where do you think there\\'s the biggest potential either for up or down side from a segment perspective or end markets? Sure, I\\'ll take that one. So I think the chemical and energy market continues to offer the biggest upside for the business. So we\\'ve already raised the outlook in pharma, and maybe we could do that again. But I think both the big end markets for the -- for Agilent are very solid with potential upside in chemical and energy. And that\\'s why I mentioned the -- some of the noise. So as soon as we can get some clarity on trade policy, I think that will -- really will calm things down. And if that happens fairly soon, I think it would be really good news for us in this space. So I think the chemical and energy market offers the biggest upside for us. And then although we\\'re trying to take a very objective outlook on China, maybe the -- it\\'s always hard to predict how quickly these things happen. We painted what we think as sort of, if you will, a longer tail scenario, but we could actually find a move through the process much more quickly. So I think that might be an area where you could see some upside relative to our guide assumptions. Yes. And just maybe, Mike, sorry, on that. The ICP-MS comment, is that decoupled from the China food comment in that... Well, no, it\\'s actually part of the China story. So it\\'s actually about -- what, about $10 million, I think, or so? About $10 million. So we... $7 million, $8 million, close to $10 million. So I would like to round up a bit, as you can tell. But that was just a byproduct of the product is hot right now. So we\\'re -- we just had a really, really high backlog. And as you may know -- I think you know this already, Ross. Particularly in China, you have to get an IVL license to get the products through the approval  government. So that took a little bit longer. And I think, Didier, we\\'ve already shipped those this quarter. So it would have been nice -- I mean, for this, recall it would been nice we got them in last quarter but I think it is... Yes, it\\'s in the bag for the quarter. It\\'s already been shipped and booked. But again, it was this more of a backlog issue because we\\'ve been seeing such strong growth particularly in China for ICP-MS. Hi, good afternoon and thanks for the time here. My first question is actually on margins. I appreciate the commentary that you have a good degree of confidence that the underlying margin expansion trend is intact. But as I look at the last few quarters or the last three quarters at the incremental margins, they\\'ve been tracking below the 30% target level. I wonder if you might help us understand why the trend is evolving along those lines. Are there any operational items to call out? And when could we see - a return back to the 30% plus level? And yes, it\\'s interesting. The impact of mostly currency on both the top line and the gross margin is fairly significant. So you are absolutely right. When you look at our unadjusted operating margins, reported operating margins incremental in Q1 and Q2, they were, respectively, 32% and 20%. If you adjust for currency and a little bit -- but that\\'s very minor for acquisition. But on a core basis, you get to 36% for Q1 and 34% for Q2, so very much in line with our model. So it is mostly the impact of currency. And what happens there is that with the weakening of the dollar, it increases the numerator -- the denominator, sorry, which is the revenue. And it has negative impact because of the hedging policy on the numerator, which is the margin. So all in all, if you adjust for that, you get back to our model regarding core operating margin incremental. We have some data in our annex, I think, we\\'ve published. Or anyway, if you want, I can take you through the details, but that\\'s basically the impact. Okay. And then two quick ones for the DGG line. One is, I wonder if you could give us an update on the time lines for the capacity ramp in Colorado. And then, two, could you speak to the trends that you\\'re seeing on immunotherapy assays, PD-1, PD-L1 assays, given all the enthusiasm out there now for TMB testing as a diagnostic approach for IO? And I\\'ll get back in queue. Thanks. I\\'m glad we had a chance to be able to point to other members of the team for a couple of questions. I\\'m actually going to pass this over to Jacob in your old role. And what I would just say, to start things off, is we just completed recently a review of the factory build-out in February. And I think we have the latest information. So Jacob, if you wouldn\\'t mind taking those two questions. Yes, absolutely. So thanks for that. And again, a reminder that we see a very strong market in the NASD business, the nucleic acid solutions for API business. And so we\\'re very confident that we will have a -- continue to have strong growth. And as you also reminded ourselves about this, Steve, is that we are in a situation where we have more demand than we have capacity. So we are now building out and we\\'ve done that for a few quarters now but building, and it\\'s very impressive to see the site coming along out in Frederick out -- close to the Boulder site. And we\\'re still progressing according to our plan, and we\\'ll expect to have products coming out here in basically a year from now. The PD-L1. So PD-L1 on the IHC platform and the question is how is that going to compete against the tumor mutation burden and other genomic assays. And what we see and what we believe is this will be complementary. First of all, most IHC continues to have a growth trajectory. We had a very, very strong penetration over the last 18 months, and we continue to see the growth here. What we believe is that -- and what we can see in the market is that immuno-oncology is just much more complex than probably one marker is giving you information about. So what we believe is and what we can see out there, we can see our customers are using that, the ones that start with TMB, is that they are using both and they will continue to use both markers. So we don\\'t see a business cannibalization. We actually think there\\'s a lot of synergies between the markers. Great. Mike, I\\'m curious if you could give us a sense of how chemical and energy orders progressed through the quarter? And as we look at this business today, is it any less cyclical today, especially given the new product cycle than perhaps it was 3 to 5 years ago? Great question. So the first one, I think we saw nothing out of the ordinary in chemical and energy. The only thing I would contact, I mean, in terms -- I mean, comment on would be, again, chemical and energy grew in China but not as much as it normally would grow just given the shorter period of time. But chemical and energy looks fine to the whole quarter, nothing out of the ordinary. And I think there\\'s probably a case in May that it\\'s a little less cyclical just because of the fact that there\\'s a lot more pent-up in aged equipment than it was when we started the cycle three or five years ago. So I think it is the more -- a more cyclical business for us, but I think to some degree, I can\\'t handicap it. But directionally, I would say it is a little bit less cyclical than it has been in the past. And a couple for Didier. Number one, on the pharma outlook for the year, maybe I missed that, what the new outlook is for core growth from pharma. And then secondly, would you mind walking through the hedge and the translation impact? I see $6 million in the supplement -- in the back of the supplement packet, but curious if that includes both the hedge and the translation effect on OP. Yes. So in terms of pharma, Mike mentioned that we are raising our full year pharma outlook and we are raising it from 5% to 6%, so slightly raising it. And in terms of the impact of currency, you\\'re mentioning the $6 million and that\\'s the impact for the full year. Precise number is $5.4 million. And it\\'s a negative headwind that comes from mostly translation impact offset by some gains due to our hedging. So it\\'s the net of the two and continues to basically offset whatever direct impact you have from the translation. Maybe just starting with another question on China, just a cleanup question. You mentioned that you believe the days effect related to Lunar New Year resulted in a $10 million headwind. I think you said specifically within CrossLab\\'s. Did Lunar New Year have a broader impact on the quarter? And if it did -- I may have missed it, if you quantify that. No, no, no. We were just trying to show kind of like a normalized growth rate, what it looked like, for the quarter. And you\\'re exactly right, the $10 million, just because the customers weren\\'t in the office or in the lab for that day. Clearly, the business will come back. And I think that makes the CrossLab number that we report even more impressive because we delivered double-digit growth with that effect. So in a normal quarter, we\\'ve had a much higher reported growth. And Doug, if you don\\'t mind, while we\\'re on China, there\\'s -- I think there\\'s a report -- I know we\\'re going to spend -- there\\'s a lot of focus, rightfully so, in the call about what\\'s happened in the food segment and the market in China. I think it\\'s important though, the overall dynamics of the China market where we play, for example, pharma, academia and government, chemical and energy. I was just in China two weeks ago speaking firsthand to our customers at Sinopec. So those markets are still very robust, and we can expect a lot of growth from them in the coming years. So again, I think it\\'s also important to kind of think about the overall context of the China market. We know there\\'s been a lot of puts and takes this quarter with Lunar New Year and this reorganization of the ministries. So happy to answer any additional question you might have on China as well. Yes -- no, that\\'s really helpful, Mike. And I guess kind of what I was getting at is there\\'s that $10 million impact on CrossLab and what was, even with that, a really strong quarter for that part of the business. There\\'s presumably a broader days effect on the business, which may be harder to quantify but certainly have an impact on overall growth. Is that a fair statement? Lunar New Year -- the day’s effect of Lunar New Year, it\\'s easier to quantify within CrossLab, but presumably, it has some impact on the broader business, which you didn\\'t quantify. Yes, that\\'s a little bit tougher for us. So that\\'s why we were hesitant to put something out. We count the days... By instrument, they would have bought instrument in - with one week less in a quarter but - whereas for service consumables, we are really - those are lost days. Yes, okay. So then a broader guidance question. Your reaffirmed guidance assumes you maintained a 4% to 4.5% year-over-year growth rate for the remainder of the year. If we look at 1-year comparisons in the two year stacks, it seems like you\\'re assuming that growth moderates a bit relative to recent trend. In spite of actually sounding pretty good on most fronts, are you baking in a little more cushion than you have recently to account for unforeseen surprises just given all the incremental uncertainty in a couple of areas that you described in your prepared remarks? That\\'s probably somewhat of a fair assumption. I think that what Didier and I are trying to do is we try to guide in a way that will accommodate if we have a surprise or two. And look at what happened this quarter. We were able to beat our EPS guide and the consensus on the EPS side, but we hadn\\'t seen the ICP-MS shipment delays or the reorganization of the Chinese food ministries. So we\\'re able to accommodate those within the guide. So that\\'s our philosophy. And I think we\\'re hoping to be able to set up the second half so, if something else would happen to occur that we hadn\\'t seen coming, that there\\'s room in there for us to absorb it. Okay. That\\'s great. And maybe one last one. There were a lot of timing dynamics in the quarter. Oil prices may be working in your favor. Trade policy uncertainty may be causing things to take a little longer than maybe before. With all that in mind, any chance you\\'d provide some directional commentary on order trends, book-to-bill, anything like that? Beyond the fact that we can tell you that the pacing of the orders was nothing unusual beyond, I think, maybe discussing specific to chemical and energy, Doug, but I think your comment about some of the orders taking a little bit longer in the U.S. because, okay, let\\'s see where this thing -- where lands. So I think that\\'s -- I could comment on cycle time to order close in the U.S. No, no, no. And the earlier question was, \"Hey, Mike, where do you think your upside could be to your plan?\" I think it is chemical and energy. So... Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. A question maybe for Jacob, hi Mike, a question for Jacob in his new role, if he\\'s willing. A lot of discussion on the mass spec market... Okay, good. We\\'ll put him to the test then. In -- just in the mass spec market, you guys have been pretty active on the development side. I think you called that out as a strength this quarter. Can you just maybe talk about the growth that you\\'re seeing? If you separate out the high-end research side from the more routine, applied market products, how does growth compare there? So I know Jacob would love to jump in on this question, but I think he just had about a few weeks to get close to the business. So I know you\\'ve been digging in a bit but why don\\'t I take this one, which is -- the routine market is really where we\\'ve been focusing a lot of our new portfolio moves. The Ultivo LC/MS is doing very well relative to our targets, and that\\'s really -- it\\'s really focused in the places where you have the highest volume in the routine market. So that\\'s where we\\'ve been doing really quite well with the most recent introduction. That being said, some of the enhancements we made to our portfolio, particularly on the bio LC/MS side, have really enhanced our position on research side. So we\\'ve seen growth, strong growth in both segments of the mass spec market. But I think just given the volume in our businesses in the routine segment, that\\'s been the driver for the overall revenue for the -- for LSAG, but really quite pleased with both portfolio moves we made there. Jacob, anything you\\'d like to add to that? Yes, okay. Well, my second question is actually on DGG sort of a similar tack. I mean, you did specifically call out the way the demand was shaping up for tissue and staining products. Can you do the same on the genomics side? I mean, what are you seeing as far as the contribution from sample prep  especially given that there are some new products there as well? By the way, I\\'ll pass that to you, Jacob, as well. But just a reminder or 2, when we look -- I think called out in my script, but when we look at the growth rates of our DGG business relative to the Q2 last year, it\\'s probably about a 3-point effect given we had order cancellation that was booked all in -- around NASD business in Q2 and that -- on a normalized basis, DGG growth would have been 7% in Q2. So with that, Jacob, if you could just add some thoughts on the genomics side. Yes, absolutely. I\\'m certainly more comfortable in taking that question. But we\\'ve actually seen quite a good performance in genomics recently. I think you have seen the overall market perform very well, and we have certainly benefited from that. So we have seen very strong growth in our SureSelect business, especially with the XT HS that came out. I think it\\'s six or nine months ago. And we see very high demand, adoption of that. Now the V7, as Mike mentioned here, just came out some weeks ago. And the good news here is that it\\'s -- we have seen very good feedback from our customers, but we won\\'t -- we haven\\'t really seen it in our numbers yet. So I think actually, that\\'s a good opportunity in front of us with that product also. Okay. Maybe just one follow-up. Is growth on the Target Enrichment side kind of in line with NGS growth overall? Yes. Sam, I know you\\'ve been looking on that site. I\\'m dying to get you on the -- get your voice on the call as well. So why don\\'t you take that one? Yes, happy to take that. And absolutely, what we\\'re finding is good growth returning for our Target Enrichment portfolio consistent with what you\\'d expect in the NGS market if you look at the others that are participating there. We\\'re seeing that both with our larger accounts or national accounts and global accounts, if you will, as well as the broader marketplace, so very happy with the growth that we\\'ve seen. And based on what we are seeing directionally, we expect that to continue in the coming quarters. I wanted to follow up on Dan\\'s first question related to mass spec. Have you seen any changes in the competitive environment recently? Can you provide an update just on how the Ultivo is resonating in the market versus your plan? Yes, Jacob, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll take this one as well. So actually, the market has been fairly stable. We haven\\'t really seen any major moves of significance by any of the competitors. And then for us, this is such an important new offering for us because we\\'re not yet the leader in this space. So it\\'s not an installed base replacement marketplace. This is actually a market expansion play for us. And again, we\\'re playing to -- one of our strength is really to provide tools to the routine market where they want robust, reliable instrumentation that gets the job done. And that\\'s really what we\\'re -- we do quite well in addition to providing leading-edge technologies for the research side of the business. Great. Thanks, Mike. And you\\'ve -- on M&A, I just want to follow up on that. You\\'ve certainly been active in terms of a string of tuck-in deals now. Are there any additional pieces of the puzzle that you need to put together at the clinical NGS workflow? And can you talk about where the investment is going in terms of either content or informatics or the platform itself? Where are you investing there? Yes, some great questions. And again, some teasers for our June Analyst Day. We\\'ll spend a little bit more time going through our thinking around M&A. But as you know, we like M&A in markets where we know the customers, where we know that we have a channel and really can leverage the scale of Agilent. And that\\'s the kind of opportunities we\\'ve been pursuing. Relative to the NGS workflow, we\\'re continuing to build that out. We\\'ve brought in the sequencing chemistry, as we just mentioned. And then we\\'re in pretty good shape right now, but there\\'s always things we can do perhaps on the informatics and content side. And Sam, anything else you\\'d add to that? I think, Mike, you\\'re exactly right. Just to further detail out, we feel very good about the fact that we have a number of gold standard elements of the NGS workflow, be it ours or the NGS workflow that\\'s being used broadly. But there, definitely, is opportunity for partnership or adding content inorganically -- elements, sorry, such as content at some point. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. First, on Dako, can you give some commentary on how the Quest rule-out has gone and any opportunities for incremental wins in that space? So Jacob, you\\'d like to comment on the former Dako business, which we\\'ve been referring to as our pathology business. I know that amidst of the roll-out, that\\'s been a point of major dialogue in the company to move us into -- Dako into Agilent. So how are things going with Quest? Well, things are going very well. And it\\'s been a while since we announced that deal, but usually, these things take actually some time to implement fully. But we have a very good traction and more of -- half of the instruments has been installed in the sites. And we also start to see the -- a good uptake in the revenue. So we\\'re very pleased with where we are. We\\'re very pleased with the partnership with Quest. We have also seen that business resonated in the market and there are other types -- similar types of accounts that is interested to look into the opportunity. Right, great. And then can you just remind us what percent of your China revenue is food? Is it similar to the breakout of the total company or more heavily weighted in China? Catherine, if you don\\'t mind, hold on for a second. Didier is pulling out his calculator. My guess is -- I think it\\'s probably a little bit heavier weighted relative to the global average in Asia. Hey Mike, could you talk a little more in granularity about where you\\'re heading with this operating margin, like specific actions? I think your COGS program, you\\'ve been working on that, what, the last year or is it longer? What other initiatives do you -- are you working on? And then I guess layering on that, Didier, are you leveraging your manufacturing to stay at that 30% incremental operating margin as well? Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. And Didier and I are going to go through this in a fairly high-level detail when we see all of you, hopefully, in June. But conceptually, we\\'ll be doing -- this has been a multiyear phase program with different areas of prioritization and focus. And the message that we\\'re going to deliver in June and I\\'ll share right now is there is still more programs behind the numbers. So when we talk about the margin expansion, it\\'s not just a hope and a dream. There actually is something behind it. And the something behind it, to your question, Paul, would be really very heavy work in the -- or the fulfillment area, manufacturing, particularly focused on material costs, supply chain, value engineering will be big movers for us in terms of reducing our ongoing material costs. We also have initiatives around how we manage our pricing and discounting. If you -- we think we\\'ve got room there in terms of how we think about the pricing and discounting. And then we\\'re also making some major investments in our R&D systems that we think will allow us to come to market more quickly. And then from a cost standpoint, take a lot of costs out of our platform cost because we\\'re going to force the sharing of common components across all our divisions where historically, our divisions have operated fairly independently on an R&D side. Didier, anything else I missed there? And then last, Mike. On academia at plus 2%, where do you think it will shake out for the year? 2% seems kind of below market right now. Yes, for that quarter, I think that\\'s fair. I think when we look at our guide for the full year - where were we on that, Didier? I think we were at about 5%, right? About mid-single digits? 5%, 5-ish plus, so mid-singles. So - and we\\'re actually quite bullish on academia and government, Paul. The Agilent team -- and we\\'ve gotten sort of our active owner, if you will, a couple of years ago really refocusing on how we sell into academia. We have a company-wide academia program. And like I said earlier, the funding conditions we see are more favorable than they were a year ago. So we think this combination of improved Agilent capabilities and funding environment bode well for continued strength throughout the year. And again, I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the Q2 result. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess first, for Didier, I was noticing your expected interest expense for the year is now down, I think, maybe $12 million or so versus last quarter, just wondering if there are any initial comments on that. And then secondly just -- if there is any additional color on the Ultivo and the feedback you might be hearing from customers on why that\\'s being adopted so well so far now that\\'s been out there for 6 months. So I\\'ll take the first question, yes. You are absolutely correct, Steve. And part of that is the higher interest -- higher yields, higher interest income, more cash available. But I must say that part of it is also that our previous forecast was extremely conservative. And then relative to, Steve, your question on the Ultivo. So if you remember, the initial value proposition, which was the , this high-performance instrument in a very small footprint and easy-to-use instrumentation, rugged. So -- and it\\'s stackable. So that value proposition, which we thought would resonate with customers but you\\'re never 100% sure until you actually get product out in the market. So -- and as you can imagine, very much like we\\'ve seen with the Intuvo, which is -- it\\'s so different that often, customers are saying this really works as advertised. And yes, it\\'s working as advertised. So I think what\\'s been happening here is the value proposition we thought around the new workflow for the customer, now we\\'ve been able to prove that it actually performs as intended. We\\'ve really been getting a nice uptake. And again, I think this goes to our ability to really understand what it is that customers want and really how to help them with their -- both their science but also the business operation side of their lab. Okay. Then if you don\\'t mind, if I could squeeze in one more follow-up. The Chinese ministry-related delays or, I guess, cutbacks, did that have any impact here in 2Q? Or is that -- the $20 million of push out is that just a second half phenomenon? No. We think about $5 million or so is what we estimated in Q2 and then the other $15 million in the second half. Okay. So you\\'ve got $5 million from that and then another $7 million to $10 million of ICP-MS delays as well in China? Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I had a question -- I was just trying to understand -- not sure if it was covered. In terms of weakness in pain management, my understanding was the reimbursement was already lowered here some time ago. Was there another downtrend? Or what\\'s driving this weakness here? And could you size that business for us? I think it\\'s this working out the excess capacity that was in that space. So we saw one of the customers went  customer went bankrupt in the space last quarter, and it\\'s primarily associated with our refurbished LC/MS business. It\\'s probably the biggest piece, right? A little bit of everything really. I mean, it\\'s really when you sort out the part that comes from DGG, that\\'s a positive and it\\'s offset by about two points related to everything else, so the refurbished business but even a little bit of service and consumables, a little bit of instruments, a little bit of everything,  has any significance. But altogether, it took away two points of growth in clinical and diagnostics. And we highlighted in the call just because there hasn\\'t been any new market development. I think what\\'s been going on, though, is just the capacity is coming out of the system. Got it. So two points on DGG was the impact, okay. And I just wanted to clarify just one last thing on China. I mean, last call, you highlighted a number of efforts targeted to enter into the entry level in China in terms of instrumentation, somewhat of a value line. So my assumption was those were targeted towards food given that these labs are more independent and food labs are somewhat cost-conscious to begin with. So after this regulation is set and done in six to nine months, what\\'s your expectation? Do you think that line would be more in demand? Or would you think more premium offerings on the market are likely to fare better here? So I just wanted to understand that and maybe just around overall impact to the rest of the peer group as well. Yes. Puneet, thanks for the great question. And I think what you may have been referring to was the value line of new consumables and chemistry products we introduced specifically for China. What I\\'m going to do is have Mark maybe make a few comments to that, and I\\'ll double back and provide you some commentary on instrumentation as well. Sure, and I\\'ll just voice what you had said, Mike. It\\'s a value line that we\\'d introduced well over a year ago in China, been very well accepted. That being said, it wasn\\'t necessarily targeted. The food market targets anybody in the general space across broad sets of markets. So we intend to obviously continue to build out that value line as time goes on and we\\'ll find market-specific offerings but that wasn\\'t -- the intent is to go specifically after food. It just turned out, as you know, 40% of the business is derived from there. But to your question about the -- thanks, Mark. The question around the composition of instrumentation, I think you still expect to be very heavily focused on mass spec, which is the tool of choice in food safety analysis and also food authorization. So whether it be GC/MS, ICP-MS, LC/MS, there is a growing market for routine instrumentation, still high-quality instrumentation but less features. And that\\'s what we\\'ve been doing with our -- primarily our chromatography portfolio on the GC and LC and molecular and spectroscopy  spectroscopy side to build out that for routine. But relative to food safety, we think there\\'s going to be a very heavy demand for mass spec. But again, it has to be -- what we\\'re seeing, as the business starts to migrate into the Tier 3, 2 -- Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, you really need to make sure you have an instrument that\\'s robust and easy to use, which has been our design back there. By the way, I think we -- I should have commented earlier, too, which was the dynamics of the food market are changing in China as well as who buys. So we\\'ve been focusing a lot on the government agencies, but we\\'re also starting to see more and more testing push to third-party contract testing labs, where the Chinese government say, listen, we\\'re not going to pay for everything ourselves and fund and build all the labs. So that also could be -- I talked earlier about the give and takes in the market and potential upside, which is dependent on how quickly these -- the volume shift from some of the centralized labs into the contract testing labs. That could bode well for us because we\\'re a really strong player in these areas. Again, we want to see how things shape -- shake out here over the next few months before we actually call that\\'s what\\'s happening. But I think it\\'s important to understand that dynamic as well because even though we\\'ve been through a major ministry reorganization like this a couple of years ago, the trend towards more testing done in third-party private labs is new. Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Mike. Just on the capital deployment front. Can you talk through an update on the larger-sized deal pipeline? How large are you comfortable going with the improved balance sheet post repatriation? And then would you do a larger scale earnings diluted deal? Or should we think of that as not on the table? You mean earnings? If I think -- I\\'m going to go to the second question. If I understood correctly, if we were to do an acquisition larger than we\\'ve done so far, we would do an accretive deal. So we would not be doing large technology -- or acquisitions of companies that weren\\'t profitable or marginally profitable. So my model works and I can bring in like a technology acquisition, and we\\'ll go through some of the details with you in a few weeks. But the model works. I could bring in a technology acquisition on Lasergen, but don\\'t assume that\\'s sort of our norm. We actually -- we prefer to do bolt-on that have revenues and profit. And the -- we\\'re going to -- we\\'re open to larger bolt-ons. I would just leave it at this. We want to make sure that we want to -- we\\'re still, I think, quite disciplined with our -- with the use of our cash, and we use the standard financial metrics on how we look at returns. But I think the biggest thing -- the biggest takeaway I\\'d like to share with you is that we really want to do deals that are in the areas that we know. So don\\'t look for us to do what I would consider transformational deals where we\\'re often in a space where we don\\'t know the customer base, we don\\'t know the markets and we don\\'t -- really don\\'t know the business as well as we should. So we want to stay in a place in the markets where we know quite well. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then I know exploration is only 10% of the chemical and energy segment. But given the move higher in oil, can you just talk to how sensitive that business is to higher oil prices and if you\\'re baking any improvement related to improved conditions there? Usually, it\\'s a -- great question. Usually, it\\'s fairly sensitive to movements in prices, and we\\'ve seen in the past where we\\'re completely shut off. I\\'d say that that\\'s why -- that\\'s sort of behind my earlier question. You may have teased it out of my response, which was -- you would have expected this exploration piece to pop even faster in the U.S. than it has been. It\\'s not down like it was before but -- and that\\'s why we\\'re saying, okay, there\\'s some noise for some of our customers. Matter of fact, I was just reading an article today in a journal about some of the -- some of our customers in the -- in this area, they\\'re trying to figure out what is all this hire. I get my stuff. My aluminum pipe comes in from a country in Europe, and I\\'ve got to fill all these forms with the U.S. government. I\\'m not really sure what\\'s going on. So that\\'s what -- that\\'s the kind of stuff that I was talking about earlier. So long story short, he should -- they should respond pretty quickly to changes in oil prices when the changes are dramatic. We haven\\'t seen it as robustly as we would have thought in the United States given the movements in oil prices, and we\\'re trading to the best of our ability to what\\'s the noise in the market right now around trade. Thank you. And at this time, I\\'m showing no further questions. I\\'d like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for the closing remarks. Thank you, Amanda, and to everybody on behalf of the management team for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I\\'d like to wish you a good day. Thank you.

Thanks for joining us on today\\'s call. Before I discuss the Q3 financial highlights and our updated outlook I\\'m pleased to have Bob McMahon join the call. Bob is an excellent choice for Agilent’s next CFO and a very capable successor to Didier. Bob brings a strong track record of leadership to our team. Many of you already know Bob from his previous role as CFO of Hologic. He officially assumes the CFO role beginning September 1. As Didier hands of the baton, he will serve in an advisory capacity until his retirement at the end of October. Bob and Didier are working together to ensure a smooth transition. I first met Bob over a coffee in Palo Alto where we shared our perspectives on business and company culture. We had an important conversation about values and their importance in business. I knew immediately that Bob would be a great fit for the Agilent culture and of course his management style and business acumen are a perfect match for our approach to creating shareholder value. Bob has joined Agilent at an exciting time. I\\'m confident he\\'ll help us lead the next phase of Agilent growth. While I\\'m very excited to have Bob join the Agilent team I will greatly miss Didier\\'s partnership and counsel. He has played a key role in the transformation of the company and our excellent business results. It\\'s important for the CEO to have a very capable CFO. I couldn\\'t have asked for a better partner. So thank you Didier. You will be missed by me and our Agilent team. Now, let me turn to our Q3 financial performance. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter with both growth and earnings exceeding our expectations. Our core revenue grew 6% and is above the high-end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 is $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance despite currency headwinds since our last guide. This is a 14% increase from a year-ago. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.6%, which is an increase of 110 basis points from a year-ago. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of improving our core operating margins. Let\\'s take a closer look at our results by our end-markets. We continue our strong Pharma performance with 8% core growth. This is against a tough compare as we grew 10% in Q3 \\'17. We see strength across all our business groups with particularly strong performance in mass spectrometry, Cell Analysis, CrossLabs consumables and services and genomics. Growth remains robust in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. Our Chemical Energy market revenue grew 12%. We are quite pleased with this strong growth, again against a difficult prior-year compare of 10%. Ongoing market investment remains positive. This is in spite of tariff rhetoric and retaliatory policies you\\'ll be hearing in the news. From a product perspective, strength in spectroscopy, GC, CrossLabs consumables and services is driving this result. Geographically strong gains in China and Europe are leading the overall global growth. Revenue grew 3% in academia and government in line with expectations, strong performance from Cell Analysis, molecular spectroscopy, ICP/MS and CrossLabs services and consumables are driving the results. China and the rest of Asia are delivering double-digit growth in this end-market. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 5% led by strength in genomics and our reagent partnership business. This offset continued challenges in the U.S. Pain Management market. Food revenue declined 1%, strength in the Americas is being offset by declines in Europe versus a tough compare of 35% growth rate last year, and as expected, China instrument sales were also down this quarter. Environmental forensics is flat this quarter. Forensics growth was offset by the expected temporary slowing of instrument sales in China environmental. Geographically, let me first start with an overview of China. Our overall China business remains strong, growing 10% this quarter. Strength in China is being driven by double-digit growth in our two largest end-markets, Pharma and Chemical and Energy. Our CrossLab and DGG businesses also grew by double-digits. We continue to expect healthy overall market conditions. This is more than offsetting any temporary slowing of instrument sales in the food and environmental markets. The business is also strong in the Americas and the rest of Asia outside of China, with these two regions delivering healthy, high-single-digit growth. Europe was flat on a tough compare of 12%. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter with broad-based strength and stand out performances in the Pharma, Chemical & Energy, and China markets. Now, let\\'s discuss results from our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. This result is being driven by robust growth in the Pharma and Chemical Energy markets. From a product perspective, LC/MS, Cell Analysis and ICP/MS are leading the results. Ultivo our game-changing LC/MS triple quad continues to be well received. Geographically demand in America and China are leading the results. Let me share a few examples of how we’re executing our strategy to increase the depth and breadth of LSAG solutions portfolio. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Genohm in early May. Genohm complements Agilent informatics capabilities by adding laboratory management services. By integrating Genohm\\'s LIMS platform into our OpenLAB portfolio, we can provide complete and integrated informatics solutions to our customers. Customers are very focused on informatics as a way to create insight and drive lab efficiencies. We are determined to lead in lab informatics. For example, last week Agilent released the first software supporting the new standardized data format called the Allotrope Data Format or ADF for short. This format was created by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies for the pharmaceutical industry. By standardizing the collection, exchange, and storage of analytical data captured in laboratory workflows, labs will be able to transfer and share data across platforms. We are proud to be the first company to develop and launch a commercial product to support this standard. We believe the adoption of standards like ADF will both shape the future of Lab Informatics and drive the adoption of our solutions. In addition, our internal LSAG innovation engine continues to deliver. We just released the Agilent Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay kit. This new and unmatched product will enable biologists to enhance their understanding of how live cells functions in real time. We are a leader in live cell analysis and continue to expand our offerings in this fast growing market. The Agilent CrossLab group continues outstanding performance with 8% core revenue growth. Gains across our major end markets led by double digit growth in chemical energy and strong results in pharma and Food. Performance was balanced across consumables and services. China led growth in all regions with mid teens growth. CrossLab is a key growth driver of the new Agilent. We are delivering on a mission to improve both the science and the academics of our customers labs. As we expand the strength in the CrossLab platform, we are creating more value for our customers and Agilent. For example, during the quarter, we announced two acquisitions to further expand our consumables portfolio. We acquired the business assets of Ultra Scientific, a provider of chemical standards and certified reference materials. On August 1, we also acquired ProZyme a provider of biopharma consumables for glycan analysis. As you know, glycan analysis is essential to development of biotherapeutic drugs and we will now directly participate in this fast growing biopharma market segment. We continue to invest and build on our leadership position in China. We recently opened a new logistic hub in Shanghai. This hub will enable faster delivery of parts supplies and consumables to laboratories. This is the first of five forward stocking locations we are establishing. This allows us to improve our service and the speed at which we support our customers. Our focus on digital investment is also delivering results in gaining traction. Our digital channel is growing at a record pace. For the first time ever over 50% of our consumables orders are now digital. China is leading the charge on this front. We are improving the customer buying experience, expand our customer reach and driving growth. The diagnostic and genomics group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Excluding our NASD business, which declined as expected in the quarter the DGG group delivered core revenue growth of 7% against a tough compare. Let me further explain. As we\\'ve mentioned previously NASD revenues are batch based, which can make the revenue vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing of customer acceptance. As expected, the business declined in the quarter as is going up against a 45% growth rate in Q3 of last year. We expect the business to return to growth in Q4. As I mentioned, without this variability of reported revenue effect, this quarter, our core DGG business grew 7%. A few additional comments on our NASD business, I just returned from a visit with our team in Colorado. The capacity expansion underway will allow us to meet the growing demands for GMP grade oligonucleotide and CRISPR offerings. I\\'m pleased with our progress on our new facility and the strong market environment. For example, just last week, one of our customers, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Onpattro, a first-of-its-kind targeted RNA-based therapy to treat a rare disease. This is wonderful news for Alnylam and most importantly their patients. NASD remains a long-term growth play for Agilent and I\\'m excited about the future. Back to the overall DDG results. Strong results are driven by double-digit growth in genomics and strength in our reagent partnership business. Geographically outstanding growth in China and Japan drove the results. We continue to strengthen our ability to support the fight against cancer and other diseases. Burning Rock Dx received China FDA approval for their human lung cancer NGS detection kit. Agilent SureSelect reagents are used as part of this panel and our own PD-L1 companion diagnostics product received expanded USDA approval in cervical cancer. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AATI, Advanced Analytical Technologies Incorporated. AATI provides capillary electrophoresis base solutions for fully automated analysis of a range of molecules. This acquisition builds on Agilent\\'s existing expertise for providing customers with a more comprehensive set of solutions, for NGS workflows and other applications. NGS\\'s driving and will continue to drive strong growth of this new business to Agilent. With the addition of the AATI team, we create a new biomolecular analysis division with DGG. This new division now also includes our complementary microfluidics business, previously part of LSAG group. Didier\\'s team has reflected this change in our current financials along with the company financial restatements. Now, let me provide a few remarks on where we are in the Agilent journey and our near-term outlook before turning the call over to Didier. Let me start with a few comments on tariffs. On the customer side, we are not seeing changes in customer buying behavior. On the duty front, we have planned for and have taken actions to partly offset the impact of expected increases in tariff-related duties. This proactive approach resulted in a small 500k impact on our Q3 results. In Q4, we expect an impact of approximately 3.5 million of incremental duty costs or approximately $0.01 of EPS which has been incorporated into our latest guidance. Looking into 2019, if the tariffs remain in place, we plan to aggressively reduce the remaining effect via potential changes in our prices and further adjustments to our Supply Chain. For some time, we\\'ve been on a path to increase shareholder value. We\\'ve been focused on delivering strong growth, while expanding core operating margins and putting our strong cash flow and balance sheet to work in a more impactful manner. Q3 results demonstrated our continued commitment to creating value for our shareholders and customers. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results while deploying our capital as committed. We returned $291 million in capital to shareholders through repurchasing $243 million of our own shares and paying out $48 million in dividends. We\\'re also investing in the business. We closed four acquisitions, paying out $430 million in the quarter and announced two more acquisitions. This is a record number for Agilent and will further strengthen our company\\'s foundation for growth. As we continue to aggressively strengthen our portfolio via the Agilent innovation engine and M&A, we are also continuing to execute on our agile Agilent customer experience and efficiency improvement initiatives. The twin drivers of our success continue to be a strong portfolio and a customer focused way of doing business. Now a few words about our outlook going forward. The Agilent team continues to capitalize on healthy end markets. We remain confident in our outlook. We are increasing our full year core growth and earnings guidance. Didier will walk you through the details, but we\\'re raising our guidance for core revenue growth, operating margin and EPS. The Agilent team remains committed, confident and energized about our future. In our Agilent DNA is our team\\'s ability to drive customer focus innovation coupled with operational excellence. It is this powerful combination that would continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion. Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Didier who will share more insights on our Q3 financials and guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. First, let me express my appreciation for Agilent employees\\' passion and professionalism in accomplishing the mission, creating shareholder value and finally for their support for all the years. With Mike\\'s continuing leadership and Bob\\'s contribution I\\'m convinced that the best is yet to come for Agilent. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, both on a year-over-year basis and versus our guidance. On the revenue front, we did our midpoint guidance by $40 million, after excluding currency headwinds of $11 million and contributions from our two recent acquisitions ATI and ULTRA Scientific of $5 million. Our core revenue growth of 5.9% was well over the midpoint guidance of 4.25%. Our adjusted operating margin of 22.6% was 110 basis points over last year\\'s and 120 basis points over guidance and we delivered a core operating margin incremental of 55%. EPS were $0.05 about the midpoint of our guidance. During the quarter we bought back 3.76 million shares for a total of $243 million and paid $48 million in dividends. Finally, we repatriated $1.5 billion of our offshore cash. I\\'ll now turn to the guidance for fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.24 billion to $1.26 billion and EPS of $0.72 to $0.74. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 4.7% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is projected to have a negative impact of $21 million on revenue and $2 million on the operating profit. Our 23.6% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 100 basis points sequentially and up 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis even after funding the Lasergen R&D. The increase in tariffs effective early July is expected to have a negative impact of $3.5 million, as we have initiated actions to our supply chain. And those actions are complete mid-2019, we expect the net annualized impact to be approximately $9 million excluding potential pricing actions. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2018. The Q4 guidance is expected to result in the following fiscal year guidance. First, at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 6.1% on a core basis or 60 basis points over the previous guidance. The revenue guidance of $4.87 billion is $10 million over previous guidance including $22 million due to the acquisition of AATI, Ultra Scientific, and ProZyme, with currency having a negative impact of $32 million. Second, our EPS guidance of $2.70 at midpoint is up $0.05 on previous guidance and corresponds to a 14% year-on-year increase. Third, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 22.6% or 60 basis points higher than in fiscal year \\'17. And fourth, our core operating margin incremental is expected to be 39% for the fiscal year, at the high-end of our operating model. My pleasure, ma\\'am, thank you.  And our first question will come from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi guys. Thanks for all the help here and thanks for the time. I\\'d say first it\\'s hard not to echo some of Mike\\'s comments. Didier, really appreciate everything you\\'ve done being such a great partner for us, so I hate to see you go and Bob, welcome aboard. Bob, I have to say Didier is a pretty unique guy, as someone who shared some of his lineage, it\\'s going to be hard for you to match that. The questions I\\'d like to focus on I\\'d say first are very high-level for Mike. When you made the decision to raise the guidance at core, it would be really helpful for you to just kind of talk us through; here is what after a good quarter, maybe confident in saying look we\\'re going to beat the expectations that we had set earlier in the year. What really jumped out to you in terms of things going better? Great question Steve, appreciate the opportunity to share that with you. So, obviously we have a good view of our order funnel so that gives me one level of confidence which is the strength of the orders, but what really gives me a lot of confidence moving forward is two dimensions of the story here. One will be the end-market strength, both Chemical and Energy and Pharma continue to be very strong. And as you know, coming into this year, we had positioned Chemical and Energy as sort of the upside of the plan that was sort of the wildcard to our business, and there were some concerns that perhaps all the rhetoric around tariffs and other things a few months ago might actually be quite detrimental to this marketplace which in fact has not at all occurred, so I think that it\\'s the continued strength in both of those two end-markets, and I think geographically Asia led by China, we posted a really strong China number and then the Americas was also quite strong for us. I think the fact that our two largest geographies in terms of countries in China and the United States are really doing quite well, gives us a lot of confidence about the outlook from a market perspective. And I think we\\'re really positioned well to win. Our portfolio continues to become much more competitive and as you know we have unique value proposition with this CrossLab platform which really allows us to capture a lot of the growth that\\'s out there as well. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups before I jump back in the queue. One is Mike, you made a comment about customer behavior on tariffs and I appreciate the follow-up there. But it will be really helpful if you could spend another minute on it. It sounds like your perspective is that the tariff headlines aren\\'t changing the way people really think about doing what they do. I wonder if you could give us even just some anecdotes on what you\\'ve done on that point? And then Didier it was a really good quarter in terms of core margin expansion, the incremental is really good. Any color on what it is that you\\'ve seen that made the quarter so strong on that front? And how should we think about seasonality there would be great. Really appreciate it. Let me take on the first question. So, when I have been out talking to the customer base, we talk to people in the pharmaceutical industry, we talk to people in the research space, whether it be in academia and in the private sector, they plan on -- they\\'re taking a long term view of investments on purchasing our equipment, purchasing our solutions are absolutely critical for their enabling their growth plans if you will and research plans. So they\\'re not at all distracted by the tariff discussion. As I mentioned on my last call, we have seen some cautiousness in certain aspects of the chemical energy market where they were a little bit slower to approve the deals, but still getting the deals approved. It\\'s the same kind of situation we had last quarter, so no new changes in customer buying behavior. So this is coming directly from conversations I had with customers. So again, that gives us a lot of confidence about our outlook because despite all the noise and rhetoric out there, it really hasn\\'t yet affected any of the actual buying behavior of customers. Obviously it\\'s creating some work for us relative to adjusting our supply chain and production locations to mitigate the duty impact side of things, but in terms of customer buying behavior have not seen any real changes. And then Steve, on your question on the core operating margin incremental you\\'re right. It\\'s been impressive at 57%. The reasons are multiple, we started off with last year\\'s compare that was a little bit of a soft compare. We had the operating margin down a little bit sequentially from Q2. Then there was good operating leverage, good mix certainly the impact of all the Agile Agilent programs and we certainly don\\'t expect to maintain such a high level of operating margin. But in all seriousness, I think going back to few some of the things that Didier outlined at the AID meeting in New York, where he said listen, our pipeline and our programs are as robust as ever in terms of really allowing us to work on the operating margin incrementals. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hey. Thanks. Mike I want to follow-up in some of the strength in China. Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there? I think you called out environmental weakness in the slide, so maybe if you could talk maybe where there some softness. And then on the supply chain dynamics, can you maybe flush that out a little bit? I think you do some of the TC production there as well as in Delaware. So can you may be just talk about how you are thinking about potentially moving Supply Chain if you need to? Sure so happy to do so Tycho. So let\\'s start with China. Again very important market for us and we were just delighted by the strength in the business, so if you look at the six end-markets we had strong growth in all but two and then we actually had foreshadowed this coming in our last call saying, hey we know there\\'s some things happening relative to some realization -- ministries in the country nothing happened to us relative to the competitive side of the business. So we saw really strong, continued strong demand in Pharma, in Chemical and Energy, investments in Academia and Government hints back to some of the comments I made around tariffs. And as you may recall in our AID presentation, we talked about the opportunities we had with our CrossLab business and our DGG business, and you saw us starting to deliver on those promises with really strong double-digit growth in both of those businesses, and then relative to food and environmental we think it\\'s a temporary situation as related to the instrument purchases. You have to keep in mind though that they will continue to buy consumables and services from us and we\\'re just waiting to have the reorganization complete, the budgets finalized and then we know-how to follow the money where it\\'s going to go because two things are really happening here. You\\'ve got the consolidation going on where new budgets are created, being created in a new consolidated set of ministries and then part of that money is also getting deployed to what they call tier 3 and 4 cities so we\\'re following the money and we\\'ll be ready to capture once it\\'s there. Oh, yeah I forgot about that so relative to the Supply Chain, as I mentioned in my script, we took some actions actually in advance of the formal announcement of the tariffs, so we\\'ve already relocated our production for China-made products into our site in Wilmington Delaware and now we\\'re in the process of moving aspects of the Supply Chain which is also subject to the tariffs, but we\\'ve already moved the production in some of the Supply Chain. Okay. And then two quick follow-ups, for NASD you highlighted kind of just the inherent lumpiness in that business and the fact it\\'ll return to growth in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about how we should think of the ramp there next year ahead of the capacity coming online? So we\\'ll be able to, we\\'re going to try to get as much growth out of our current facility as possible and then the growth, the expansion will start to come on line in the second-half of next year. The current plan is the second-half of \\'19, you start to see some initial revenue is starting to ramp through the quarters, and Didier I think we put out a number of… So it really gets started next year and then when you get into 20s when you get the real full year ramp and Bob and I and Didier were just in Colorado as I mentioned and had a chance to also review the progress of the facility construction and capability expansion, but also what\\'s going on relative to perspective demand from customers, so the pipeline looks really encouraging. I think its part of the mix, growing with the average. I think that\\'s it. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s an outside contribution, but solidly delivering. Hi, good afternoon. And before I get to the questions another Harvey thanks to Didier you\\'ve been a great leader at Agilent and I know I can\\'t speak for many of us and saying we really appreciate your help over the years and I look forward to grabbing another glass of wine at some point soon as always it will be your choice. And Bob while Agilent has big shoes to fill, it\\'s great to know they made such great choice, so congrats through and the company. So now for the questions. On Q4 guidance, can you talk a bit more about the rational behind 4.7% core growth. This would be a deceleration versus what we saw this quarter and that\\'s in spite of comparisons that don\\'t appear much different. I didn\\'t hear anything in your prepared remarks regarding timing dynamics or changes in momentum relative to what you generated year-to-date. Is it fair to assume you\\'re baking in some conservatism here? I\\'ve admittedly having a hard time figuring out why growth wouldn\\'t continue at around 6%, the underlying rate for most of this year. So am I missing something on end markets or timing dynamics or something else? I think we decided to stay true to the guide for last year we had and even though as Didier retire. So as Didier has mentioned in prior calls, we don\\'t assume everything\\'s going to be perfect in the quarter. And again, the one that could go one way or another always has been chemical energy. So if that business holds up and it has been holding up, we should be in a good position to beat that number. >: Great. And then sort of related from a buyback standpoint, the stock was in the low-60s for much of the quarter. I think you still have about $240 million in the buyback authorized and if I\\'m not doing that math right there\\'s certainly enough dry powder there to put in place another authorization. I\\'m just wondering why you weren\\'t a little bit more active in buying shares during the quarter ? : Yes. Thanks for that Doug. I think we\\'ve -- I think the numbers are right about 240, 270 from a...  So you\\'re in the right range. And we actually -- Bob we\\'re fairly aggressive because we went outright after what we saw was a dislocation in the stock price after the Q2 announcement and bought the $200 million right away and then continued anti dilutive. We obviously continue to look at that during the upcoming quarter. Okay. And one last one. You guided us to expect China food revenue growth would start to rebound in early fiscal 2019. Based on what you\\'ve seen over the past few months, anything that would tell us or tell you that this is aggressive or maybe things start to thaw a little more quickly than anticipated? I think I want to stay with those initial estimates. So we signaled that in the last call and released our experience. It takes a good six months or so to kind of work for these things. And I think I want to hear from my team, it\\'s tracking along the same lines. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Just expanding on Tycho\\'s question on supply chain given the tariffs and focused, could you just walk us through the import export dynamic in China, just looking explicitly kind of how much of the China revenues is being imported from the U.S. and may be where the majority of those revenues is being manufactured? And then kind of the same thing on U.S. revenues anything being imported from China there. So from China to the U.S., it\\'s a relatively small amount of Agilent\\'s business. It\\'s primarily the gas chromatography product line and related support parts. So it\\'s about $100 million and that\\'s why the 25% gives us about $25 million gross impact. And then as we mentioned, we\\'re going to reduce that amount over time to even before pricing adjustments $9 million on an annualized basis. And then going the other direction, basically, China, we import from the U.S. the GCMS and many reagents in the chemistry that is made in the U.S. but there\\'s no tariff at this stage. There might be in the future and we\\'ll update you on the potential impact that it\\'s not significant really at the end of the day. So it\\'s about $100 million and that\\'s why the 25% gives us about $25 million gross impact. And then as we mentioned, we\\'re going to reduce that amount over time to even before pricing adjustments $9 million on an annualized basis. And then going the other direction, basically, China, we import from the U.S. the GCMS and many reagents in the chemistry that is made in the U.S. but there\\'s no tariff at this stage. There might be in the future and we\\'ll update you on the potential impact that it\\'s not significant really at the end of the day. That\\'s helpful. And then just staying in China, given the soft July data points out this morning including China industrial production coming in light of expectations, can you just kind of talk through the cadence of results in China this quarter? How are trends in July in particular given that data and then also the tariff rhetoric was kind of increasing during the month so just curious as you went through the quarter how you guys were feeling. Great question, I saw that same article as well, and I have based on what we saw it was having no impact so we saw no hesitancy in customers or any signals from our field that things were different. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open. : Thanks. good afternoon.: Mike, just in looking at Europe, it was flat in the quarter. Realized you lapped a tough comp there, but you did so too in the second quarter as well, just curious if you\\'re seeing changes in any of the end-markets if you could just give us a little more color on what you saw in that region? I think we did obviously have a tough compare and I do think that it\\'s probably fair to say that the region is a little bit slower than it was last year, but it\\'s dramatically, not dramatically different. I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the Q3 results. I even mentioned to Didier, should we mention the World Cup, but and the reason why I say this is to not get overly worried about the third quarter result is spent some time with our field teams and the European funnels look pretty good. The only thing that we\\'re kind of keeping an eye on is whether this situation in Turkey could actually spread more broadly across Europe, but again, I think that no significant changes in the overall market environment in the third quarter and I wouldn\\'t over-interpret the one quarter\\'s results. : Thanks. And I guess secondly, with the Alnylama approval now on the tape, I\\'d be curious as to how you\\'re thinking about the next leg of capacity expansion at the NASD facility? When you might be in a position to perhaps pursue I guess the next capacity build-out and what the indicators might be that might lead you to do that? Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. We\\'ve already made a decision to make the investments and that decision was made probably about two years ago. This is a very unique capability right into the company and I really think it speaks to the high barriers to entry and probably ultimately the margins we expected to derive in this business. So we made the decision based on our forecast of likely demand and I think the most recent announcement about success is one more proof point that the market\\'s going to be there for the products. And Didier, you want to add something?  As a compliment as you know we\\'re only firing up Train A in the facility and as for Train B which we doubled capacity, we are certainly not ready yet to push on the button the around is still an orphan drug. It\\'s not high volume we are waiting their confirmation that our customers will move into a commercial space and then we\\'ll fire up Train B. So it\\'s there. It\\'s obviously at a much cheaper cost than the whole facility built up and we\\'re certainly ready when we see that\\'s this confirmation that a lot of our customers are bringing commercial products onto the market. Thanks for the additional insight Didier. We\\'re bringing on this one train just to be clear. Next year, it\\'s second half of 2019 roughly $100 million ish kind of additional revenue then we could bring on another $100 million or so with Train B. Operator: Thank you. Our next question we come from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. : Thank you. May be a couple more on China. First off, you heard all your peers\\' report now and it does seem that the environmental and food headwinds are something that Agilent is uniquely calling out. So do you have any opinion on why? Is there a reflection of the product dynamic that these customers are buying? Or maybe just some share in a micro basket of customers? : Yeah happy to share my thoughts here. So there is something going on here. It\\'s unique to Agilent because we are uniquely the leader in the ministries where the consolidation is occurring. So that\\'s why you\\'re seeing Agilent calling us out, where others didn\\'t have probably any business there. So we\\'re the ones getting impacted the most and I think that\\'s why you\\'re hearing us call out and other people kind of rightfully not seeing it as a major issue. There\\'s nothing happening competitively in terms of sharing new offerings. It really is a macro effect where we\\'re really strong and we think this is going to be a temporary situation as things move out. And again, I just to remind you overall China business grew double digit for Agilent in the third quarter. It was the fastest growing region we had in the company. : That\\'s helpful color. And then just a tariff related follow-up. So you mentioned a couple of times that your remediation effort assumptions don\\'t get include pricing actions. So could you comment on your ability to get price in some of the affected product lines? Do you think you have pricing power? Would you expect that is a lever you could pull or not? : Yeah. As I indicated in my call price is one area that you can use to offset the tariff impact. You would have this on the more broad based as opposed to a 25% increase or whatever it may be on a core product platform. So it will be broad based and we think we have the ability to do that. Again, it comes back down to the differentiation of portfolio. If you have something truly a value with differentiated from your competition, you\\'re in a position to be able to do that. So we\\'re not overly concerned about our ability to mitigate the impact on the P&L, on tariffs as they stand right now. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. : Hey guys. I echo the view. Obviously Didier it’s been a great time working with you and we\\'ve seen the business through quite a transformation and Bob I know VJ is very jealous but we\\'ll look forward to spending more time with you as you get ramped. So may be just -- can we take out Pharma for a little bit? It seems like performance in the segment has been better than maybe what you would have foreshadowed some time ago and it feels like maybe there\\'s a bit of share you\\'ve taken and obviously you\\'ve called out some of the emerging markets strength, but maybe on a product or any other way you want to cut it, give us a little bit of a feel for how you feel like you\\'re performing there maybe versus the peer group? : Yeah, Ross thanks for the opportunity to comment on this as Pharma being our largest market. This is really important for us. And we often focus on this one product platform in this area, but the strength of Agilent we have is broad-based portfolio, and what we can see is particularly in the area of mass spectrometry gaining a lot of share both on the LC/MS side as well as there\\'s a number of new regulations that are driving growth of ICP/MS into the space, so we have the breadth of the portfolio to go after those. And again I\\'ll ask Mark to make a few comments here, but I truly believe that this CrossLab platform that we\\'ve developed really has allowed us to take really outsized growth in this space and you can start to see the numbers have starting to be quite significant and important to Agilent and Mark if you could just maybe add a few comments about what you think maybe happened to your business in Pharma. : Thanks, Mike and maybe at top level, the picture that we\\'re seeing really strong response in all aspects of our Pharma business. I think we\\'ve mentioned certainly at AID that we invested a lot in our chemistries business particularly to address the biopharma area. That part of the business is going very well, a lot of complementary pieces coming together in our chemistries business around the Pharma space at large. And then enterprise services, we continue to see strength in that area, in Pharma too and as we\\'ve mentioned many times, when they\\'re looking for better productivity or improving some of the better management of the overall assets, we\\'re seeing that and moving into the smaller mid-sized Pharmas and the biopharma companies in general. So long story short is it’s been very sustainable. I think we\\'ve continued to see high-single-digit growth over the past few years in this space, and our product portfolio will lend it that way. Certainly we\\'re planning on keeping that momentum going in the future. : And Ross I\\'d just close off on this. I think Mark has been able to develop a scalable platform, right. So discussion before used to be only focused on large Pharma with the game being over and I think the platform is very scalable to small and medium-sized Pharma as well. : That\\'s helpful, Mike. And so maybe one for Sam, you\\'ve done some acquisitions. You closed out the Lasergen interest. It feels like you\\'ve got pretty good momentum at least in terms of tuck-in M&A in that division and your division. How are you feeling about sort of pipeline on things you have in front of you because it\\'s probably the area where you have made the broadest set of things to bring in? And then from a product standpoint particularly on the companion side, it seems like there\\'s a couple of things that could potentially go your way. How are you thinking about that business? : Yes, thanks for the question, Ross. Maybe I\\'ll go -- I\\'ll start in reverse with your questions. For our Companion Diagnostics business, we remain very excited about that. We are continuing to do work with the partners that are publicly known in terms of Merck and BMS. But beyond that we\\'ve had a very active effort to increase what we\\'re doing and develop new Companion Diagnostics with new pharma partners as well as to expand the number of biomarkers. PD-L1 is very important and it\\'s an area that we are continuing to focus on. : I think you gave me some stats the other day of how many countries that was registered in some of these indications. : Yes, absolutely. You\\'re talking about PD-L1 in particular for the 22C3 variants of that which is for KEYTRUDA and Merck. We\\'re now registered in over 83 countries for more than five indications, so that\\'s good progress and more to come on that. But in response to your question, it\\'s beyond that, we are working on a number of new biomarkers with a number of new partners. So I think that there is goodness to come that we are driving for the coming quarters and coming years. : That’s right. Thank you, Mike, for that. We are expanding our footprint because the work is very real. It\\'s more than pipeline and things that we\\'re signing. And then Ross with respect to your question on general pipeline, I think I had alluded to you and actually mentioned at Analyst and Investor Day even within our next generation sequencing series of products that we have something called MAGNIS, which we’ll be introducing in early 2019, which is a platform which will automate, starting with DNA going to prepared libraries. We\\'re excited about that and that\\'s just an example but we continue to have new products and you\\'ll see it coming out of both from what’s been our traditional part of our Diagnostics and Genomics Mixed Group but also now out of AATI. So the pipeline will complement the market opportunities and we have a number of things that we\\'ll be able to share in the coming months and quarters. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. First, you made a comment regarding seeing good demand for both small molecules as well as biopharma customers. Just was wondering, as it relates to the small molecule side, is that a change in the trend that you\\'re seeing, and kind of where you\\'re seeing that amongst your small molecule customers. It sounds to be pretty good demand. And then secondly, Mark, or Didier, you outperformed your guidance in the quarter by a pretty decent amount. And assuming you\\'ve had some insight on your orders, is it fair to assume that you had stronger pacing at the latter part of the quarter in the month of July here? : Yes, how about I take the first one, right? Steve you\\'re a great reader of the results and listener because when I saw that I said, we\\'ve been expecting that the growth rates will start to separate between biopharma and the small molecule segments of our overall pharma business and we saw strong performance to small molecule. We often tie that to liquid chromatography, but what\\'s going on here is two things. One is the overall demand for the ACG services which is and consumables which Mark commented on earlier so that really is our small molecule customers may not be buying new LCs at the same rate they were, but we seen a real expansion of our growth in the services and consumables around our platforms as well as our competitors platforms. And then we also show in these numbers the demand that\\'s coming with ICP/MS related to some of the USP Regs so that’s also driving some of the growth. But I think the real story here is the ACG platform. And I think the comment was around the order pacing? : We always expect the third month of the quarter to be stronger than the other month, but in the last two-years we\\'ve been a lot more linear than we used to be, so there\\'s nothing remarkable about this last month of the quarter, this month of July. : Probably relative to the orders, I just have a thing Didier. Henrik’s team did a fantastic job on the order to revenue conversion. I think we\\'re getting a lot better at making that happen pretty quickly. Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. : Yeah, hi Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter and Didier, I will absolutely miss you and welcome, Bob. I wanted to touch on just briefly quickly on ICP/MS. Could you elaborate how much of and I don\\'t know if you\\'ve touched on this from the last quarter, there were shipment delays that were recognized in this quarter. What was the outside growth excluding those ICP/MS orders catch up and just wanted to confirm if you saw any other similar revenue recognition in this quarter as well that could change expectations for the next quarter? : I\\'d have to do the math, Didier, but I think it\\'s relatively immaterial to the overall because growth rate it\\'s about 3 million bucks I think. So I think it\\'s relatively immaterial to the overall growth for LSAG in the quarter. What was the second? No, no, we would have called those out if we had any of those. I would say the demand for that product continues to be quite strong, so and I think you can expect to hear us talking about ICP/MS in our fourth quarter call as well. : Okay, great. And my another question is on Pharma. I know that\\'s been discussed a bit here, but just looking at your acquisitions, ProZyme, Ultra Scientific, and now what you\\'re doing here with Allotrope, but OpenLab, just help us understand high-level, how are you thinking about the overall long-term Pharma growth in LSAG and overall about the LC/MS business and your expectations there to deliver in this market, just help us understand how you see this evolving in a few years from now? : Happy to do so and then I may invite Jacob in this conversation here about specifically on LC/MS, but we see Pharma as we highlighted in our AID meeting. That\\'s our largest market with the expected some of the highest expected growth rates outside of clinical diagnostics for the company. So this is an area of major focus for the company, and we\\'ve talked about our solutions focus as a company and one of the reasons why we\\'ve been able to get strong growth in biopharma is not just because of the great new LC/MS partner but we\\'ve been able to broaden our solutions offering. This is where Mark\\'s play of the consumables come in to give us need of chemistry is around our platforms. And on the informatics front, we think so much of the value of customers experience with the company is going to be in informatics and we\\'re a big believer in the importance of opening standards. And that\\'s why we highlighted that Agilent being first to market commercially because this is something our customers are moving us here and some of our competitors prefer closed environments. We’ve always embraced universal connectivity, universal architecture. So philosophically this lines up with our customer focused strategy and we\\'re delighted to be the first one in there. So Jacob maybe you have a few comments about the ultra play, but also about our aspirations in LC/MS?  : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And let me just start over and echo what you are saying Mike that we believe that’s a future for Agilent in the pharma opportunity. LC has always been a big part but LC/MS has certainly been an even bigger opportunity going forward. Also we see especially in the biopharma where customers is looking for high performance but also for ease of use and our Advanced Q-TOF, Bio Q-TOF has certainly shown that and we have great success with that. But we also see that from an informatics perspective that our customers are looking for something that is faster acquisition of information ease of use again but also getting a full comprehensive overview of all the data in the lab and that\\'s where, let’s hope, is very important to get data standard across all the different modalities and further than that what we have been strong with our OpenLAB looking at scientific information and controlling your -- the hardware itself now with the Genohm acquisition we also have full insight on the sample itself. So all these investments goes into that. We see a great opportunity in pharma and the LC/MS is just getting started there. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. : If you\\'d like to swing in, you\\'re welcome to. I want to focus on some of the recent acquisitions and just if you can elaborate a little bit on your plan to scale some of the platforms. If I look at the fourth quarter, you\\'re calling for a bit of a step-up in the contribution. Is there a level you think that these could contribute at just the deals you\\'ve closed in 2019 at this point? : Yes. So we believe that these acquisitions we made are in fast growing spaces and that was one of the primary rationales of why we went down the acquisition. So, for example, you look at the AATI, NGS driving that growth. And I think Didier, when we were at New York we talked about this thing going probably 20% on their own and I think we\\'re going to stick with those numbers. We just reviewed our acquisition portfolio with our Board at the last Board meeting and all of the deals we\\'ve done are growing in excess of 20%. So, again, still the core organic growth is driving the company but we\\'re adding on these faster growing pieces and I think over time even more material to the company\\'s overall growth prospects. I think we\\'re pretty excited about AATI and a couple of other things we\\'ve done, so I think let\\'s just leave it there. : Yes that\\'s sounds good. And Mike Chemical & Energy is always the wildcard in the outlook, but could you walk us through each of the businesses, how they performed in the quarter and just how you think the funnel is coming together there? : Specific to the three business groups or specific to chemical energy? I just want to make sure I got the question correct. : Okay, good. Thank you. Thanks for the clarification. So just a reminder, we think about this segment across three areas refining, exploration which is roughly 40% of the total. Then the other 60% is chemicals which also includes materials testing as well as our semiconductor base business and all three of those segments are growing. I would say the chemicals sector is growing faster really driven by the investments we\\'re seeing in the semiconductor material space. But the good news here is all three segments are growing which is not a situation we\\'ve had say one year ago where some segments really were quite constrained. We see growth across all three of the subsegments with higher rates in the chemical/semicon piece. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. : Sorry about that mute. So jus to follow-up on the M&A question. So I know you said $22 million is the contribution in Q4. I guess in total what is the total amount of revenues that you\\'ve required this year? : That\\'s a great question. It\\'s so far we are probably -- so let me just -- hold on a second.  : I want to be sure. I don\\'t try -- I have the number off the top of my head, but I think it\\'s better if I read. : Yes, I\\'m still here. I\\'ll follow-up another one which is it\\'s also an acquisition question. I know it\\'s a little bit early to start talking about 2019, but I\\'m going to. You\\'ve got deals… : No, no. I mean you\\'ve got deals, you\\'ve got currencies, you\\'ve got Lasergen, you got tariffs, you\\'ve got a lot of stuff moving around. How do we think about margin expansion in 2019? : I\\'ll refer you back to our commitments made at the AIG. We think we have no reason to move away from those commitments to be able to do this core margin expansion. That\\'s how we\\'re setting the plan inside the company and putting all the right -- we have a number of things in slide already to ensure we can get there. : So the answer to your question is with the acquisitions we\\'ve made this year LSAG, Genohm, AATI, Ultra Scientific and ProZyme those five acquisitions we are about $25 million for the fiscal year, fiscal year 2018 and then for fiscal year, we\\'ll end up Q4 alone will be around $17 million, so you multiply by four to have the 2019 annualized number. : Right, I think we\\'re just starting that probably in early phase of ramping these things, we’re just getting a few months of revenue. Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Mike on the U.S. Chemical & Energy business last quarter you were kind of unsure about whether that might have been impacted by trade policies or whether that wasn\\'t really seeing an impact. I guess looking back, do you feel like tariff considerations were at all a factor in 2Q as the discussions started to heat up? And then maybe just on the overall seeing the outlook, is it fair to say that double-digits for the year is in the view? I mean I know the comp is tough in 4Q, but I think you could also not grow at all and still be at seven, eight, just based on what you\\'ve done so far. : Two comments on the first question, what I pointed out in the Q2 call was somewhat of a longer deal cycle that closed in the U.S. and I can\\'t scientifically approve it, but we thought that there was a level of cautiousness tied to just the overall rhetoric that was in the environment. That\\'s still there but it hasn\\'t changed and that was my concern as you know in the last call that actually it would go much more constrained. That has not changed. So the behavior we saw three or four months ago so it\\'s basically what I\\'m trying to communicate today is business-as-usual as relative to the environment that we had last quarter which did change as a result of a lot of this discussion in the macro environment. And while I\\'m not going to guide specifically, the C&E market for the fourth quarter, that would be our upside and it\\'s within reason that we could hit those kind of numbers. : Okay thanks. And then maybe just one more on the academic markets as you finish your year in that segment, are you kind of assuming that you stay low single-digit range for 2Q, 3Q, or do you think you see some NAH funds flowing and taking you a little higher. I know you just said you\\'re not guiding those segments, but maybe I\\'ll take a shot there. : I can just give you directionally. I think we\\'d expect to see some improvement over the Q3 number. Keep in mind, I think we\\'re about a 6% through the first three quarters of this year and typically, Q4 I mentioned earlier the strength in China relative to government and Academia and Government and then assuming that the rationality stays in place in Washington, we know that we\\'ll get usually a nice push in September with Federal Government, so the fundamentals look pretty solid there. Operator: Thank you. And I\\'m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. So now, it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing comments and remarks. Thank you, Brian and to everybody on the line on behalf of the management team, thank you for joining us today. If have you any questions feel free to give us a call in Investor Relations.

Before turning the call over to Mike, I would also like to share my plans to retire at the end of January making this my last conference call as Agilent’s Vice President of Investor Relations. I have enjoyed working with many of you over the years, but as Mike says, the best is yet to come and so it is also true for IR.  Well, thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover our financial results, I want to thank Alicia for her years of service, and wish her the best in her retirement. Alicia superbly led Agilent’s IR team for the past eight years. She has set a high standard for her professionalism, integrity, and transparency in her engagement with the investment community. Thank you, Alicia. You are the best and you will be missed by me. You can see this has been an emotional day for all of us and our Agilent team, and I am sure by the audience on today’s call.  This quarter we are reporting our strongest quarterly results since the 2015 launch of the new Agilent. We are ending the year with a terrific quarter. Our revenues, profitability, and earnings per share are significantly ahead of expectations.  Now, some of the specifics. Q4 revenues grew 9% on a core basis to $1.29 billion. This exceeded the high end of our guidance by more than $30 million. Double-digit, end-market growth in Pharma, environmental forensics, along with the continued strength in our chemical energy business are driving the results.  Geographically, our China business is up sharply with 16% growth for the quarter. For the year, the Agilent China team delivered double-digit growth and achieved a major milestone crossing over $1 billion in business for the first time.  Q4 adjusted operating margin is 25.2%, up 190 basis points from last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of the Agilent team improving year-over-year operating margins. Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.81 is $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Compared to last year, this is an increase of 21%. In addition, we took advantage of marketing conditions to purchase $86 million in stock during the quarter.  For the full year, stock repurchases stand at $422 million underscoring the confidence we have in our future performance. I am also pleased to report that the Agilent Board has just approved a new $1.75 billion share repurchase plan.  This quarter, performance caps off an excellent 2018. Our strongest quarterly performance translates into full year core growth of 7.1%, our highest annual growth rate since the launch of the new Agilent.  Total reported revenues grew to $4.9 billion. We continue to deliver improved profitability while investing for growth. For the year, adjusted operating margin is 23.1%, up 110 basis points over last year. Our earnings per share are up 18% for the year to $2.79. The numbers tell the story, a strong team delivering yet another stellar annual performance.  Let’s now look at the quarter by business groups. Core revenue grew a healthy 9% for LSAG, our Life Science Applied Markets Group. Product strength is broad based, driven by mass spec, chromatography, and cell analysis.  We continue to introduce innovative new products. We are strengthening the molecular spectroscopy portfolio with the launch of the Agilent 8700 Laser Direct Infrared Chemical Imaging System. This is a breakthrough in both chemical imaging and spectral analysis. We also introduced the Cary 3500 UV-Vis system, the first significant advancement in UV-Vis architecture in decades. We continued to build out our cell analysis business. We just closed the acquisition of ACEA Biosciences. ACEA is a provider of cutting-edge cell analysis instruments and will expand our cell analysis portfolio. The Agilent CrossLab Group delivered strong 9% core revenue growth. Demand was excellent across both services and consumables. We continue to invest in our portfolio and extending our customer reach. We completed the acquisition of ProZyme, expanding our offering in the biopharma marketplace. We also acquired our South Korean distributor. This acquisition expands our direct customer engagement and it further builds out ACG’s service business in the market.  The Diagnostics and Genomics Group grew 5% on a core basis. Strength in our NASD and Genomics businesses drove the quarterly results. In a significant win, Agilent has been selected by Unilabs to be a Preferred Partner for their pathology business. Unilabs is one of the largest European diagnostic testing lab providers. This announcement is another strong testament to the advantages of Agilent’s expanding workflow solutions.  Before I leave DGG, I want to provide an update on the construction of our new NASD API production facility. We remain on track for the initial production of GMP-grade APIs by the end of fiscal year 2019 with material revenue contributions in FY 2020.  Overall, it was a great quarter capping off an excellent year delivered by the Agilent team. A few final comments before I turn the call over to Bob. Agilent’s shareholder value creation model is fully activated. First, we are executing on an innovation-driven growth strategy that is delivering. Second, we continue to focus on improving profitability with our “Agile Agilent” Initiatives. Finally, we are actively leveraging our balance sheet to drive acquisitions of fast-growing innovative companies while also returning cash directly to shareholders. We have transformed Agilent into a growth company and are focused on delivering superior earnings growth. We just delivered our highest growth and profitability since the launch of the new Agilent.  Since then, our adjusted CAGR EPS is up 17%. Our business is also less cyclical today with non-instrument sales making up over 56% of our total company revenue. If economical challenges would arise, our business is now less dependent on capital equipment purchases.  Looking ahead to 2019, while acknowledging current trade discussions, we are expecting market conditions to remain solid. The Agilent team is laser-focused on sustaining our strong growth into 2019 and beyond. We have momentum.  I keep telling the Agilent team the best is yet to come. Thanks for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions.  Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. I am very pleased to be talking with you today on my first earnings call as Agilent’s CFO. Before I get started, I want to echo the comments Mike made and say thank you to Alicia. In my time here, she has been a great partner to me, and I truly wish her the best in retirement. She will be missed.  Now moving on to the financials. In my remarks, I am going to provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the fourth quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then I’ll finish with our financial guidance for 2019. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.  As Mike mentioned, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter to finish an excellent fiscal year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.29 billion with core revenue growth of 9% exceeding both our guidance and expectations. For the full fiscal year, our core revenue growth was 7.1%, a very strong performance.  As Mike spoke to the Group’s performance for the quarter, I will provide some additional details around our end-market and regional performance. Overall, the market environment is positive and based on our channel reach and product offerings, we saw broad strength across most end-markets. Pharma, our largest end-market was up 14% with double-digit contribution from all business groups.  Both the small molecule and biopharma segments performed well. Traditional areas of strength, as well as newer areas of strategic focus such as cell analysis and a strong performance at NASD contributed to the results. Chemical and energy grew an impressive 7% against a very strong comparison of 15% core growth last year.  We continue to see positive ongoing market investment in this area. Balanced gains in both LSAG and ACG were driven by strength in spectroscopy, LC-MS, supplies and services. Demand for our materials characterization applications continue to drive robust ICP-MS growth.  Environmental and forensics grew 17% ahead of expectations with good demand across major regions. Growth was balanced across both end-markets. Forensic saw notable demand for Cobalt Raman spectroscopy and environmental for LC-MS and ICP-MS.  Academia and Government reported 10% growth as funding environment stabilized, while diagnostics and clinical grew 1% and food was flat as expected against a tough 10% comparison. Geographically, we also saw broad based strength. China grew by 16% accelerating from the 10% core growth we saw in Q3 and as Mike mentioned, passed the $1 billion mark in sales for the year in the fourth quarter. Other Asia and Japan grew by 12% and Europe and the Americas had solid mid-single-digit growth. In addition, we continue to be pleased with the revenue contribution as non-instrument revenue contributed 56% of the total in Q4. Looking forward, we see non-instrument revenue growth outpacing instrumentation driving an increasingly recurring revenue stream.  Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 gross margin of 57.8% increased 170 basis points compared to the prior year. This was due to product mix and volume, as well as our order fulfillment and supply chain organization continuing to do an outstanding job driving cost savings using our “Agile Agilent” approach.  Operating margin including adjusting for the Keysight billings was 25.2%, up 190 basis points due to higher gross margins and top-line leverage on operating expenses even as we invested more in R&D. This led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year and more than double the rate of revenue growth.  Now before moving to FY 2019 guidance, I want to touch on a few additional financial metrics. We continue to generate very strong cash flows. This quarter, free cash flow was $336 million and for the year, we generated over $900 million in free cash exceeding our commitment.  In Q4, we returned $133 million to shareholders buying back 1.3 million shares for $86 million and paying out $47 million in dividends. We also completed the ProZyme and Young In acquisitions. With Young In, we expanded our direct sales and service capabilities in South Korea. For the fiscal year, we’ve returned $613 million to shareholders, buying back 6.4 million shares for $422 million and paying out $191 million in dividends.  As Mike mentioned, we closed a record number of acquisitions in 2018 deploying $516 million. We ended the year with $2.2 billion in cash, and $1.8 billion in debt and we just closed on ACEA Biosciences last week. So we are starting 2019 where we left off in 2018.  All in all, we entered 2019 with health end-markets, good momentum in the business, and a very strong balance sheet.  Now let’s turn to our non-GAAP financial results guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2019 beginning with our full year guidance. We expect 2019 to be a strong year overall, but before I get into the actual numbers, let me mention a few important points.  First, we anticipate currency will be a headwind in 2019. Based on exchange rates as of the end of October, we expect currency will reduce reported sales growth in 2019 by roughly 220 basis points translating into roughly $110 million negative impact for the full year. For comparison, our 2018 reported sales growth benefited by 210 basis points from currencies.  Now partially offsetting the currency impact will be a larger contribution from recent M&A including the recently closed ACEA Biosciences acquisition. And in addition, starting in fiscal 2019, we adopt a new accounting standard which changes how we present pension expenses and benefits on the income statement, in effect, reclassifying certain amounts to other income and expense. While this has no impact to net income, we do expect this will reduce forecasted operating margins in FY 2019 by roughly 40 basis points. As we move through the year, we will provide a restated 2018 to provide an apples-to-apples comparison.  And lastly, we are taking a different approach in setting guidance ranges that include both upsides and downsides. So I would encourage you to model to the midpoint of guidance at this stage. Now for the full year, we are expecting revenue to range from $5.13 billion to $5.17 billion in fiscal 2019 representing core growth of 5% to 5.5% and associated reported growth of 4.4% to 5.2%.  Currency is estimated to negatively impact growth by 2.2 percentage points with M&A contributing roughly 1.6 percentage points to 1.9 percentage points of growth for the full year.  Now on to our EPS guidance. For the full year, we are forecasting a range of $3 to $3.5 per share adjusting for the negative currency, this translates to 9% to 11% growth in EPS and a 7.5% to 9.3% on a reported basis. Included in this guidance is roughly $4 million per quarter in tariffs. This is slightly higher than the estimate we provided last quarter and is related to List 3.  A few other metrics as you build your models. Embedded in our forecast is modest operating leverage after accounting for the pension adjustment. We are also expecting the total of interest income, interest expense, and OI&E to be $10 million to $15 million in net expense inclusive of pension and Keysight billings.  Guidance is based on a full year tax rate of 17%, down a point from 2018 and diluted shares outstanding of approximately $322 million, flat to Q4 of this year. We expect operating cash flow of between $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion and capital expenditures of roughly $175 million. As previously mentioned, the Agilent Board has authorized a $1.75 billion repurchase program and we plan at a minimum to offset dilution throughout the year.  We also continue to look for M&A like ACEA and other recent tuck-ins and have the financial flexibility to be opportunistic in share buybacks as well.  And finally, we have announced raising our dividend by 10% continuing a streak of double-digit increases providing another source of value to our shareholders.  Now turning to Q1 guidance. For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.265 billion to $1.28 billion representing reported growth of 4.4% to 5.7% and core growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. Please remember that we are going up against a very tough Q1 comp last year where we grew 10% core.  First quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 per share which is roughly 9% to 12% ex currency and 7.6% to 10.6% reported growth.  Now before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying, we are very pleased with the financial results and the continued hard work and focus of the Agilent team laying the ground work for future growth and as we enter 2019 with strong momentum.  Hey, thanks. I’ll be the first to congratulate Alicia. It’s been great working with you. I guess for, either Mike or Bob, I am wondering if you can maybe help us put some parameters around the guidance for next year either by end market or segment.  Can you maybe just talk to whether, like, for example, food can get back to growth post the China restructuring? And how should we think about C&E, it moderated a bit against tougher comps, how do you set up for that next year? Hi, Tycho. I am in the room. This is Mike and Alicia really appreciates your remarks. And Bob, I think maybe you can provide a little color on Tycho’s questions.  Yes, I think, - thanks, Tycho, and I am pleasured to speak with you. In terms of the end markets, I think we still see nice end-market growth across all the markets. When we think about the various markets, pharma, we would expect leads the way, probably faster than the overall company growth, but we are expecting growth throughout all of the end-markets.  So, we expect a return to growth in food for sure, but also continued performance across all of the businesses or all the end markets. And really, we expect kind of broad based growth across the end-markets as well as our divisions.  Yes, Tycho, I think there’s this one more proof point that we think we can continue to grow the business both in terms of winning some big deals but also as the PD-L1 expands in terms of various cancer types being able to be treated by the Keytrudas and Opdivos of the world. So, it was just more of a proof point, say, this is why we have confidence. We can continue that growth trajectory.  Okay. And then just lastly, can you comment on the cell analysis portfolio today with ACEA and Seahorse. I am just wondering whether there are revenue synergy opportunities here or how do we think about the portfolio and the ability to kind of penetrate the single cell market a little bit further? Yes, Tycho, I am going to make a few opening comments here and then pass it over to Jacob. But, as you know, we made our first foray into cell analysis with the Seahorse acquisition and we really were attracted by the growth in this space as well as what Agilent can bring to really accelerate the growth of acquired assets in this space, and we are super pleased to have ACEA and the ACEA team as part of Agilent, but I am going to turn it over to Jacob and you can share your perspective as well.  Yes, absolutely, Mike, and I am as excited as you are, perhaps even more even since it’s hitting my business. And so, I should say, we started into the cell analysis business with the Seahorse acquisition followed by Luxcel and now here recently with ACEA. And all acquisitions gives us a very differentiated position in the cell analysis business where Seahorse is really a technology that allows for measuring the up and down regulation of metabolism based on oxygen consumption.  We now have ACEA Flow, the flow cytometry which is a great way and a very easy way of doing cell characterization, identification based on the genotype and what – where this would position a market is that it is very ease of use and re-allow many different labs that today feel it’s very difficult to work with flow spectrometry to really start to get their hands around that.  And finally, the ACEA has the xCELLigence platform, which is a great way of measuring cell survival viability through impedance measurement, so those three different modalities really gives us a strong position, especially in the immuno-oncology and CAR-T where they basically bring the ability to measure live cells and how they operate under different conditions is going to be key for the entailing in  and immuno-oncology. So, you will see us continue to invest into this business, but I am very pleased where we are today.  Yes, Tycho, you can see the excitement we have on this product expanding on the cell analysis business and I think this is a perfect example of how a company coming into Agilent with this great innovative new product and really benefit by the scale of Agilent.  Good afternoon and congrats guys. And Alicia, it’s always been a pleasure. Maybe let’s talk China. So, if I look at some of the color you gave on a segment basis, it seems like, not only did the segment outperformed, but it was pretty broad based. And when you called that, I think in the presentation, Academic as well, and some P&B, more traditional pieces of what we think your China business being.  So, maybe just give us a feel for the cadence in that business for next year and sort of the underlying assumptions and how you are thinking through some of the macro noise in whether or not tariff or anything else will impact the sort of demand curve on maybe the non-life science business next year. Yes, happy to do so, Ross. So, I think you anticipated some of my response which really was broad based. I mean, we were delighted with the numbers, 16% double-digit for the entire year, but we saw a strong growth in Pharma, Academia, which really the China government is really focused on doubling the number of their – what they call the first-class university, and so very robust funding environment. You saw the overall numbers for Environmental and Forensics and lot of that was being driven by investments in the Environmental space by the Chinese government. We are seeing a strong growth in the aftermarket, continued strength in chemical energy and returned to growth in the food segment. So, the overall view of China was very positive for the quarter.  And as we look at next year, I think, Bob and I were talking about this earlier, we are guiding - embedded in our guidance assumptions is high-single-digit growth in China for next year and despite all the noise that’s out there, what’s really happened on the ground is a lot different. Chinese customers want to buy the most innovative tools for their work.  They want to support the government-led initiatives and areas such as investments relative to healthcare for the citizen are getting funding and we are one of the preferred choices for those customers. So, despite the noise in the environment, the environment remains very solid.  And maybe on the margin side, obviously, all of the volume absorption in the quarter just giving how much you need the revenue piece by obviously whole, but it feels like still underlying a lot of what you’ve been doing across the business is flowing through on both the gross margin and OpEx line.  And so, maybe give us a feel for how much you think of sort of the margin outperformance kind of came from, maybe just the underlying revenue stream, versus maybe some of the other actions you are doing that in the context of some of the investments obviously you are going to making next year into Lasergen? Yes, Ross, as you know, it’s more than just volume that drove the margin expenses as you noted. And I just lean it over to Bob, my guess is, probably two-thirds volume, one-thirds OpEx and specific gross margin initiatives. So, as I noted in my cost script, we have a – whole series, we call “Agile Agilent” initiatives which continue to drive efficiency and much more effectives inside the company.  A lot has been focused on the gross margins of late, but also we are going to play a lot of this and we’ve been aligned this to our OpEx as well. And again, I would underlie the importance of our digital transformation are under really is going to continue to allow us to drive improvements here.  So, when I came to the role a couple of years ago, I wanted my margin expansion not to come just from volume and that’s been our mantra and our formula since we started the new Agilent four years ago and it will continue to be our approach as we move forward. Bob anything else you’d add? Maybe what to hit your mic here?  Yes, I was going to say, I think the other thing is, if you look at the various group, each one of the group has actually improved their profitability in the quarter which is nice broad based performance and so, it’s not just one business or one product that’s driving the profitability. It really is across Agilent.  That’s a great build, Bob and one of the things that we noted to our Board last week when the Board Meeting was, what we’ve been doing on the gross margins of our service business as well, which is you often think about the margins are being relatively stable and flat there, since in such a high labor content in terms of delivery. But Mark and his team are really been driving efficiency with new tools and approaches. So, it really is broad based improvement across all three groups.  Thanks. Good afternoon and I would reiterate as well, good luck Alicia. I enjoyed working together. Just as my first question, I want to dig in a little bit more on the LSAG performance. I know on the product that was flagged out was LC-MS. I was curious if you could give us an update on the Ultivo launch there and just where you think you are seeing that resonate in the market? Jack, I think I’ll let you answer this question since for one of those good news answers, so let me pass it over to you Jacob.  Yes, absolutely, thanks for that question and I mean, it’s kind of an very straight-forward story that Ultivo continues to outperform our expectations. We see our customers, especially where we started Ultivo by building applications in the Food and Environmental. And they have been very happy with what they see. In the end, you can actually, with the size of it and the performance, you can actually place three in the – three Ultivos in the same place as you previously could do with one mass spec which gives a lot of opportunities in many of the labs that actually are lacking space.  On top of that, we have done a lot to simplify and improve this software and also the usability as such. We start to see now also the some accounts are really interested in taking on Ultivo. But the mass spec story and the performance is beyond Ultivo and we see a lot also in our 6545XT bioconfirm where we now see on the biopharma side that we start to see a very strong uptake on that. So, it’s really broad based that we see that our robust reliable instrumentation is picking up in the market.  Very excited about the mass spec. But there is a lot of other elements into the overall LSAG business. The ICP-MS is also doing strong. LC continues to come back with great momentum. So, overall, we are really right now firing on all cylinders.  Great. Appreciate all that feedback. Just as a follow-up, I want to get a status update on the Colorado facility. Just help if you could parse out some of the language from the prepared remarks a little bit more. Are you assuming the revenue that starts more in fiscal 2020 at this point? And then, just on the CapEx side, how much is within the $175 million guide is being attributed to the facility there? Thanks.  Jack, having the answered the question, I’ll take the first one and then perhaps the second one to Bob. So, the language in the script was just to reaffirm to the audience that we are on track as planned. And the construction is actually complete. We are now in the process of validation. We just had a review late last week on the status and we will get revenue in 2019, but what we were just showing was the big pop up when you get the full year is going to be 2020.  Yes, hey, Jack. Good afternoon. This is Bob on the capital side and to just build on what Mike was saying. Yes, that’s – we do expect some revenue contribution here. But as we’ve said consistently the big revenue uptick is in 2020. And in terms of the capital, of the 175, most of the capital has been spent at the Fredrick site already. There is some additional, but most of that has come down and the 175 is the majority of that is still actually the base business.  Now recall, that higher than perhaps it would have been earlier because of the acquisitions that we’ve acquired. So, we’ve acquired some capital associated and planned, expansion plans there.  By the way, Bob, probably also as I mentioned specific to our second site or our original site which is Boulder, we actually have found some ways to work the efficiency of efforts here and we are actually planning to get more volume out of there in 2019 than 2018.  Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. First, just on tariffs, Mike. You made a comment about the $4 million a quarter, just being up slightly, just wondering is that including any impacts from pricing or supply chain as you doing as a potential offset? And then I have one follow-up.  Oh, yes. Thanks, Steve, thanks for the clarifying question and Bob I am going to go ahead and take a shot on this and if you need of course correct me and please go ahead. But what we are planning to quantify was the actual impact of incremental duties thereafter all the mitigation efforts.  That does not include anything else. We may be doing relative to pricing. So, that’s not a complete drag on the P&L. It’s all baked into the guide for next year, but we’ve also instituted some other broad based actions to mitigate that as well. But that was just trying to isolate the specific amount of the net incremental duties to the company.  Sure. And then, just, Bob, just a quick follow-up question. I guess, I just had a clarification. I guess, two things really. Within the 5% to 5.5% core growth guidance you are providing, what is your assumption for the incremental revenue from the NASD business in Colorado?  And then, just making sure I heard you correctly in terms of operating margins including the pension accounting change, what is your assumption for operating margin expansion next year, ex this 40 basis point headwind?  Yes, so, on the NASD, what I would look at – what I would think about that is, looking at NASD in total and the total growth rate is still there. So, rather than looking at as a sweep, because we’ve actually found incremental volume out of the existing plan. So we are expecting growth in NASD next year consistent with what we shared back in the summer.  And in terms of margins, what I would say, that’s also I think very customer-driven, because customers have one batch at the one site would for us to kind of finish the work there as opposed to going mid-term into the other sites. And in terms of the operating margin expansion, what I would say is, after adjusting for the 40 basis point reduction, we are still expecting some modest improvement in operating margins. So, what that would tell you is it’s greater than 40 basis points. Good. Could you talk about - as we – would you think about that January Lunar New Year and the – with the effects you expect out of the way holidays are rolling out, how we should think about the first quarter specifically? I know there is usually been a little bit of noise around how calendars lay out.  Paul, thanks for the question. So, it’s my hope, one year as CEO of not to be talking about the Chinese Lunar New Year. And 2019 may actually be that year. So, as you know in 2018, it caused a lot of seasonality swings between the quarters and also prior year compares. The way it’s playing out this year it’s happened in the same period of time as it happened in 2018. So, Bob, I think we are not really expecting anything unusual this year from the time of the Chinese Lunar New Year.  And then, lastly, I don’t know of this question was put in, but how should we think about tax this year and also going forward even beyond FY 2019? I think, Bob has got a really good story here. So, why don\\'t you talk to him about what\\'s going to happen in 2019, already we know.  Yes. Thanks, Paul. And so, this year in FY 2018, we ended the year at roughly at 18% effective tax rate. We are guiding to 17% in FY 2019 and we are working on plans to continue to improve that going forward.  Great, thanks. Mike, maybe one for you. We are seeing continued news flow in some of the bigger build outs chemical companies in China. Can you just talk through the market demand there? I know chemical and energy are the areas you’ve been pretty bullish on historically in that region. So, where are we in the process of some of those bigger projects building out capacity in GC, some of the other areas you act as a supplier in? Yes, Patrick. I am happy to share my insights here. So, I have been bullish on the growth prospects of China as it relates to the chemical energy markets for I think a good reason, because we have some pretty good insight in terms of the projects that are underway.  And as I mentioned, I think in a prior call, a lot of this not only to support their economic growth, but also is, what they view as a element of national security as we continue to invest in the colder chemical plants to really reduce their dependency on natural – import of natural gas for example. So we’ve seen the projects they have a multi-year program.  I think we are probably in the third or fourth inning of what those could be a multi-year build out of plant capacity. And this is really important for our GC business as you mentioned, Patrick that that’s actually is the tool of choice. And Jacob, I know you just got back from a trip to China and are you hearing the same things from the teams?  Yes, certainly, Mike. It’s really just a repeat that there are plenty of opportunity in China right now with the larger SPI installations coming in here also in 2019 and 2020. So I think, there are great opportunities in front of us also in that space. So, I guess, the message here, Patrick, it’s not over yet. So, we think we got to go few more years of really solid growth in this segment of the market in China.  And I think – hey Patrick, this is Bob, maybe just to build on that, obviously, as Jacob and team lay that ground work for putting in the instrumentation, I think, Mark and his team around the chemistries and supplies business also continue to drive very strong growth in China. So I think it’s a multi-phased opportunity for us as we go forward. And so we are really excited about that.  Great, thanks. And then, Bob, maybe, I know that you’ve been on the seat for a few months. Can you just talk through kind of initial impressions, maybe a particular focus on the margin side, obviously came into nice clean balance sheet. We’ve seen some activity there between the dividend increase and the bigger share repo is a historical trend.  But maybe just on the margin side, given some cost saving initiatives that’s been in place for a few years, what opportunities have you seen confidence level and continued expansion opportunities going years out? Yes, thanks, Patrick. I think one of the things that I’ve been very pleasantly surprised with this is the amount of rigor and discipline the organization actually comes through. We probably undermarket the Agilent approach externally. But I think the teams are very operationally focused, not just on cost savings at the gross margin line, but really through increasing productivity and efficiency across the organization.  What I would say is that there are still several big opportunities as we go forward. Obviously, still focused on gross margin, but Mike mentioned the digital aspect to this and this has a multi-faceted approach. Not only does it enable us to actually do business easier with our customers and actually drive some stickiness, it also is going to be driving efficiencies in our customer service – cost per order dollar activities and so forth.  And so, as we think about that driving, I would see multiple layers – levers there. I think there is opportunity continue to do that, as well as continue to reinvest some of those proceeds in R&D. So, very excited about the things going forward.  Mike, just wanted to – hey, Mike. I wanted to follow-up on the expectations for growth in food this year. How far along are you at this point in working through the government reorganization headwind in China? Have you fully come through on the other side there? Or are you still working through some things? I think you are talking specifically to China, yes. So, by the way one of the things also when you look at our food numbers, Europe was relatively flat against the double-digit compare. So, I know we are going to – I know your question was focused on China. But that’s – we also saw some other geographic dynamics in the fourth quarter.  Albeit said, we think the business will be growing again in 2019. We think, you may recall, I think it was the second quarter I talked about two sets of reorganizations. One, we thought what happened faster which was the environmental one, which was done and you can see that the pop in some of the growth rates we had.  And relative to the food ministries, we expect that that to take longer to get that side of the reorganization done. I think that’s still holding through the form, which is we are anticipating that kind of taken through the rest of this calendar year.  That being said, we also know some of the money is got to move to the tier-3 and tier-4 cities and we’ve been actively building up our channel there over the last several quarters to ensure we can capture the growth. So I guess, the message here is, still developing as we thought a few quarters ago. Not done yet.  Yes, I would agree with that, Mike and what I would also point to is, if you look at the performance of our China business it’s accelerated quarter-on-quarter, so. And I don’t want that to be lost after just posting a 60% year-on-year growth rate for the total company.  Yes, that’s helpful. Okay. And then, if I could, just go back to the guidance range just to make sure that I had it correct. It looks like, you have tightened things up relative to where you were at the Analyst Day. So I am curious if you can just sort of hone in, where you feel like you are, maybe 50 BPS better at the low-end and then it seems like things are going pretty well.  So I guess, and you called 6% prudent at the Analyst Day. So, why trim that 50 BPS at the top of the range? So, just as a reminder, at the Analyst Day, we actually didn’t guide for 2019. We are really just trying to illustrate, that’s really about what our margin expansion might look like at different revenue levels. But I think, relative to our guide, Bob, I think we are actually feeling very, very positive about it. I think, we came out stronger this year than we did last year. So, Bob, anything else you\\'d add to that? No, I think that’s right. I think when we think about core growth of 5% to 5.5%, that’s faster than what we are expecting the overall market growth to be. So we are feeling bullish about our ability to continue to gain share not only through launch of the new products that we talked a little bit about.  But also continued market execution across our businesses and as we mentioned, it will probably led by the pharma in China areas. But we are expecting solid growth across all of our end-markets as well as geographies.  Hello. So, first question. Can you elaborate more on timeline for the share repurchase? And any target capital structure you have in mind? Yes, hey, Dan. This is Bob. I’ll take that. We are thinking about it in two ways. One is, obviously, as I mentioned doing something throughout the course of the year to maintain our share count at roughly 322 million shares and then we will be opportunistic similar to what we had done in the fourth quarter. Still little early for me to actually come out and give a target in terms of capital structure.  But what I can tell you is, I’d expect us to continue to be very active in the M&A market and I think we have an opportunity to optimize the strong balance sheet more effectively going forward.  Okay. And then, just a follow-up on your forward-looking commentary on end-markets. So, how should we think about – in regards to pharma, where you expect strength in 2019, how should we think about the sensitivity of capital markets were to climb up here? If at all, would Agilent be sensitive to that or just walk us through your thinking on that front? Yes, great question. My view is that, what’s powering the investments in pharma, it’s really about investments improve the human condition. It’s all about investing in new classes of drugs, new therapies. Whether it be the biopharma, whether it be cell therapies, various gene approaches that are going on there. We see a new class of drugs such as the RNA-based therapeutics.  So, we think they are fairly resilient if you will to those kind of headwinds, economic headwinds into the fact they would occur. And then also just to remind you particularly in our pharma space, how much of our business is non-instrument related. So, we had a very large recurring revenue business really centered around our ACG business.  Alicia is one of the only other New Mexican on Wall Street that I know, going to miss you. So, a couple of questions. So, when you look at your segments for 2019, the implied sort of organic core growth rates looking forward is something around 3% to 4% for, I would say, mid-single-digits for diagnostic and then, 7% to 8% for ACG, is that a good way to sort of look at it? Got it. And one of the key questions we are getting from investors is, obviously is the macro has been choppy. There is a lot of angst about how business has performed during the – during a downturn. I mean, obviously, you are a heck of a lot less cyclical than you once were. But I guess, could you sort of think about that how different the portfolio performed during a steeper recession. Do you sort of like lab test it what you got now and sort of think about where we have grown in a tougher time? Yes, sure, Derik. I think, you point out, one very good point which is the portfolio of business is a lot different than it was few years ago and in fact I would sort of anticipate I might get this question. That’s why I saw a comment I made in my script if economic headwinds would occur. It’s a different company. By the way we are not at all predicating that, in fact going to be the case.  And, I would say that it would probably follow a fairly similar pattern you saw a few years ago mainly reflecting – impacting the replacement cycle in certain industries, most likely the chemical market. But while the areas where the money being spent on research, I am would think it’s going to be fairly resilient. I don’t remember the exact numbers, but that would kind of like top of mind thinking on that. Yes, maybe to build on that point, Mike. As I look at the business and the characterization obviously the product portfolio that we have today is very different than what we had before and I think it’s actually more focused on what customers need in terms of solving their problems.  And so, whether that be open lab, where we are actually helping productivity and so forth for the cross labs group just in general. I actually, you could envision where you may have some impact on the instrumentation. But that potentially could be offset, because you would actually have more consumable usage going through as they are looking to keep their instruments longer and so forth or want them serviced.  And so, I think we are in better position now than we’ve ever been and as we think about where our growth is coming from, it’s coming from the fastest part of our business – I should say, is growing, is in fast-growing markets like cell analysis that we talked about before which is going to be less impacted, I think and that’s just because of research and in the pace of innovation. Our ACG business and then obviously our diagnostics and genomics group as well.  Rob, I mean, just sort of I have been sort of- what I’ve been talking about the segment growth, I\\'m just noticing that. Back in 2015 and 2016 when oil was softer, you basically were growing LSAG in the 3% to 4% range.  So I am just assuming that, you are already building some sort of – some conservatism in the numbers, just given historically how that’s what the condition of the business at that time and the business growing was growing at the time. Thanks.  Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple trying to have a leap around a point that have been raised. I think, first, maybe on margins. Bob, there have been some questions asked about some of the specific points on the margin progression from 2018 to 2019.  But to take a step there are actually a lot of moving parts, when I think about Lasergen spending, the impact of M&A, spending on NASD, the accounting change you’ve flagged in FX, I mean, any chance you have a view on what core operating margin expansion is next year to give you – what a jumping off point might be for fiscal 2020, because I’d say, it’s never too soon to start thinking about 202, right?  Yes, gee, we haven’t even finished a call for the initial FY 2019. But I will give it a shot. What I would say is, there are a number of moving pieces. Obviously, we’ve got a full year of Lasergen built into the plan. That being said, we are still guiding full year operating margins to grow despite that important investment.  And then, we’ve got NASD as well and some of the headwinds around the FX. But when I look at operating margin incremental, so this is not necessarily core, but this would be just looking at the incremental. In FY 2019, they are very consistent with kind of how we exited FY 2018 and what I would say is, we are focused on continuing to drive operating margins, but also most importantly earnings growth. Okay. And then, the second thing I wanted to see if I could get both of you, Mike and Bob to talk a little bit about was guidance policy, guidance practice. You alluded in the prepared remarks to – I hope that people would model at the middle of the guidance range.  And I got a sense from the prepared remarks that you thought that there might have been a change or at least the need for there to be a perception of change the way you guys went about constructing the guidance for the year would be really helpful to hear you talk about how you went through that?  And why you think the middle of the range is the right thing? And then, before I lose the podium here, I will echo the thanks for Alicia, thanks for being so helpful for us as we ramped up on the story over the last few years. Thanks, Steve. And I know Alicia has been enjoying all the great feedbacks from you and others today. So, as you heard in my opening comments, it’s a bit of mixed feelings about her moving on to her new role in terms of seeing her retired and so next again used to work on Wall Street.  I still have to answer the question. That’s right. So, think about, as you can see in our script, we were leaving the witness a little bit. I think you picked up on it. So I am going to make some initial comments and turn it over to Bob. So I think it\\'s important to go back in time when we started the new Agilent and I would dare to say, we only lacked credibility in terms of a company that consistently delivered results relative to expectations.  So, Didier and I really set forth a philosophy that really ensured that we are being reasonable in terms of our outlook, but also that you could count on us to deliver it. And we now have a track record of almost four years of doing that. And I would – but if we do think it’s time for evolution of approach, because and I think that’s what Bob has brought to Agilent and perhaps wanted to share your thinking there, Bob.  Yes, thanks, Mike. And I would agree. I mean, I think one of the things that we want to do is obviously continue to be and feel comfortable about our forecast, but also recognize some of the potential upsides that we have, as well as acknowledging potential downsides and try to shrink the gap.  And that’s what we’ve attempted to do here is to actually provide a little more color in terms of where we think the business is going in terms of our performance, particularly when we just come off of some very strong business and we are forecasting strong end-markets. And so, as Mike said, it’s not a revolution, it’s more of a evolution of the guidance to help – and we’ve got a track record that gives us more confidence in our ability.  Hey guys. Thanks for the questions and congratulations and thank you to Alicia. You will certainly be missed. First for Mike and maybe Jacob can comment on this as well. As you think about your innovation pipeline for fiscal 2019, what gets you most excited? Should we be expecting to see the technology used in Ultivo prior to some of your other platforms as well?  I think we are – just like any parent would be, we are excited by all the members of our family. So we’ve got a lot of great new things coming on. I made a few announcements already on things that are happening in the molecular side. But I think we got more coming, right without sharing the specifics. So, what would you say there, Jacob? Yes, I think I will not go out and destroy Christmas by go out and tell all the presents we have for you over the next year here. So I am not going to speak directly to what is coming out. But what I can say is that, I am very proud and I am very excited about the 2019 on the NPIs that will come out there.  I think, we’re already started strong with three NPIs that came out the first few weeks in the year here between the LDIR and the Cary 3500 and also the ICP-MS Water Analysis System and the ESI. So that was actually four. And there is much more to come. So I am pretty pleased, but I won\\'t speak to the specifics yet as you\\'ll be positively surprised when you see it. I would add Kevin to your comment about the technology leverage across the platforms. In fact, that is the intent both for the Intuvo and the Ultivo. In fact, we haven\\'t really had an Intuvo question today, but I would just mention that I think we\\'ve posted 14% unit growth in the Intuvo this past year as well. Very helpful. And then, Bob you mentioned remaining active on the M&A front. So, can you and Mike just comment on your appetite for potentially a larger acquisition? And then, what your key areas of focus would be? Yeah, Catherine happy to do so. I don\\'t think there\\'s really a new story here, because what we\\'ve been saying for probably the better part of last year or so is that, we\\'ve developed our own internal capabilities and then, I think we have just augmented our capability here with the addition of Eric Gerber coming over to us from the from Danaher.  We believe that we have ability to really deliver for our shareholders’ value on the M&A we do. And so I\\'m much more confident in our ability to tackle M&A and really make it part of the Agilent growth story. So we would be willing to take on larger acquisitions. As Bob mentioned in his early comments, there is plenty of room on the balance sheet.  I think it really is more about having the right opportunities and we will continue to be - remain very disciplined in terms of what we look at. But I think it\\'s really limited – our actions will be limited by availability of active targets as opposed to our willingness to engage. Yeah and Catherine what I would add to what Mike is saying is, when we think about M&A, I think we\\'re focused mostly on the three groups in the channels and the strength that we have to be able to leverage as opposed to creating a new level. Alicia, I\\'d echo that sort of you will be missed. Quick one for Samraat, if you can give us an update as to whether you\\'ve finished with the Dako rollout at Quest yet. Whether those instruments have been fully transitioned and started scaling? And then secondly, if there is a plan to port the PD-L1 assays over to the Omnis platform anytime soon? Yes, thank you very much for the question. We are, as you know, very pleased to have earned the business of Quest and we are continuing to ramp. We have a significant percentage of that business where we\\'ve made conversions. But there is still work in progress which is actually good news, that means increased opportunity for us.  And in terms of your second question, absolutely we are. It is in our roadmap to continue expanding the menu on Omnis and having PD-L1 available on this is absolutely something that is within our plans. It\\'s something that will happen in 2019. Super. And then, two quick ones for Bob. The operating cash flow growth implies only about 3% growth in fiscal 2019, any one-timers to point out there? And then, secondly, I think there was an asset impairment in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate on where that was? Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thanks Brandon. In terms of cash flow, yes, I mean I think it\\'s a prudent forecast right now at the beginning of the year. There were no one-timers really in the - in FY2018 or the fourth quarter other than the tremendous performance that we had not only on the revenue coming in early and early part of the quarter and then also – which enabled us to generate tremendous cash flows with our accounts receivable teams and so forth.  So I think it will evolve as we go forward. In terms of the asset impairment that\\'s a small business within our DGG business and we are still expecting it to grow, but not at the level that we had forecasted. All right. Good afternoon and first off, I know it\\'s been said a bunch of times already but thanks again to Alicia, we\\'ll miss you. I want to start with a follow up on an earlier chemical and energy question. Broadly, not just in China, what are you seeing among chemical and energy customers given the recent decline in oil prices.  And a bit more of an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and relatedly, what are you assuming for growth within fiscal 2019 guidance across the chemical and energy sub-segments, meaning breaking it down by chemical refining and E&P? Hey Doug, thanks. Happy to provide a perspective on that. And, as we’ve mentioned earlier, the oil price gets a lot of attention, but it really is the view of global growth that often drives a lot of this market. But we are seeing a couple of things going on here. Well, first of all, we\\'re not seeing any change in customer buying behavior.  In fact, we continue to see a lot of demand for replacement products. So, the new generation of equipment tied to our Open Lab informatics portfolio really drives productivity. So the customers are seeing an economic benefit of the investments. So even in situations where perhaps the – there is s some uncertainty about oil prices and economic growth, they won\\'t invest, because it helps the P&L by taking cost out of the structure. So, we\\'ve seen no changes in the buying behavior and really the growth in chemical energy has been really broad based. We talked a bit about China already, but we saw and again, I am talking about the CapEx side of things. It\\'s been really broad based across all regions. And then again I would just say that the – our ACG business continues to do quite well here as well. And Bob, anything else you would add there, I think? Yes, the only thing I would add, Doug is, in terms of your question around FY2019, I can\\'t give that level of specificity into the sub-markets within the chemical and energy market. But what I would tell you is, if we look at chemical and energy, we are expecting that that business to grow slightly lower than what our core guidance. Okay. That\\'s great. And Bob may be, if I can just as a follow-up sneak in a couple guidance clarification questions. First on the buybacks which have come up a couple times. Your stock seems pretty depressed relative to your strong operational performance relative to peers on a valuation basis and your balance sheet is very pristine.  Your guidance assumes a flat share count in spite of the fact that you have plenty of cash on the balance sheet to get more aggressive with buybacks and still have room to do more and bigger M&A. I guess, it\\'s still unclear to me why you\\'re not getting more aggressive with the pace and size of buybacks? Is this really a function of it just being pretty early in your tenure?  And then, I guess the second guidance clarification question would be just regarding the tax rate, your cash tax rate is still a lot lower than 17%. I am just wondering if there\\'s any opportunity or chance that ultimately the tax rate goes a lot lower than what your guidance incorporates. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Thanks Doug. You hit the nail on the head. I mean, it\\'s still relatively early in my tenure as I am trying to figure out all the other various pieces. But what I would tell you is, I think there is opportunity now. Our primary use of cash is actually to do M&A after investing in the business and growth.  And I think we\\'ve seen that starting with the work that we did in FY2018 and then just starting here in FY 2019, with closing ACEA and so forth. But I do think we were opportunistic in Q4 and I think that there will be opportunities that we will – if there are opportunities, I should say we will capitalize on them in FY2019. And then, in regards to - what was the second one The second point is cash rate. I love this one which is yes, Doug there sure is a difference between our cash tax rate and our non-GAAP tax rate and I think Bob and the team have brought down a point so far. But I think you\\'re still looking at some things.  Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, Alicia, thanks for all of the help and really great working with you. So, if I could touch first on, just wanted to clarify how much of a contribution was USP regulation and LSAG if you could quantify that? It seemed like in past quarters, we had seen some significant contribution from ICP-MS. I just want to make sure we have that number for this quarter too? Yes, I don\\'t think we have that level of granularity in terms of specific numbers. What I can tell you is that it\\'s been part of the story of a former growth and I think that\\'s a trough. Actually a massive double-digit dollar growth. And then what\\'s your expectation there of how long of a tail that could be for USP, longer term? Could you give us a sense of how many quarters or may be years that this could last? Yes. This would be just my guess. But I think it’s probably, we\\'re not done yet. I think we expect that to continue into 2019. Yes. I think we saw a lot of great performance based on that regulation in 2018 and we would also see it sail into 2019. But we have a lot of other things going on in ICP-MS and we really see that technology being applied in more spaces now with the water regulations coming up where we have really made a nice workflow.  I think that we can see a lot of opportunities there. But generally speaking, ICP-MS is just being a tool that will be picked up from many other opportunities. So, I don\\'t think that we are dependent on one part and one workflow. But we will see these great opportunities in 2019. Got it. And then, Mike on Intuvo, you pointed out the 14% growth – unit growth here. Just wanted to get a sense of – do you want to address broader applications here? My question is, would Intuvo evolve into another set of product? Or should we expect, may be potentially a next-gen 7890 here along the lines of what you have produced in past to address then the full market, compared to the GCs that you have had in the past? Thank you. Hey, Puneet. Thanks, thanks for the question. So, I was trying to preempt the audience about it. But we are really quite pleased with the pick up or really that the double-digit growth if you will of the Intuvo product, because as we said for – since the launch, we knew it would be a measured adoption by customers, because they really want to put the equipment through the paces and really be convinced that it actually does work as advertised and guess what it does.  And now we are starting to see some really nice multiple unit orders coming in particularly as it relates to Mass Spec and at the risk of being Santa Claus or destroying Christmas or ever held, Jacob said earlier, what I can tell you is that our plan is to leverage a lot of the core technologies that were developed in the Intuvo product for potential new versions of gas chromatographs and we work really hard to keep the overall complete portfolio as competitive as possible and as you know the Intuvo covers only about 60% of the application space. So there is work to do on the rest of the portfolio as well. Thank you. I show no further questions in queue. So I\\'d like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, James. And on behalf of myself and the management team, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call in IR. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\\'s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Agilent Technologies First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time.  And as a reminder, today\\'s conference is being recorded. Thank you, and welcome, everyone to Agilent\\'s first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob’s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-on-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks Ankur and thanks for joining us on our call today. I\\'d like to start by welcoming Ankur to his first earnings call as our Vice President of Investor Relations. While Ankur is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Excelling in senior leader level finance roles for over 16 years, I believe many of you on this call have already met Ankur, but in case you have not, I want to reiterate key theme he is sharing, we remain committed to sustaining excellence in our IR team and maintaining a strong relation with you the investment community. We miss Alicia, but are very pleased to have such a capable successor in Ankur. Now, on to the Q1 results, 2019 is off to a strong start. The Agilent team continues to deliver excellent results with both revenues and earnings exceeding our guidance. Q1 revenues totaled $1.28 billion. This represents 6.1% core growth against a tough Q1 2018 compare. Our performance is highlighted by double-digit growth in both our Agilent CrossLab and Diagnostics and Genomics Group. From an end market perspective, our results led by double-digit growth in the Pharma, clinical and diagnostics, and the environmental forensics markets. Our Q1 operating margin is 23.1% an increase of 120 basis points from last year. Our agile Agilent programs are driving process and productivity improvements while we also continue to invest for the future. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of the Agilent team improving year-over-year operating margins. Our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.76 is up 15%. This is $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. The combination of strong topline growth and increased margins is driving continued double-digit growth in our EPS. Now looking at results across our businesses, our Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group grew 1% on a core basis against a very touch compare of 11% growth last year. Demand remained strong in the pharma and environmental forensics markets. We continue bringing to the market innovative new offerings to fuel future growth. Earlier this month in Japan we strengthened our leadership position in gas chromatography with the global launch of two innovative new instruments, our new 8890 GC replacing our flagship 7890 GC offering and an all-new midrange 8860 GC. In addition to leading analytic performance, reliability and robustness, these two smart connected instruments offer several compelling new digital capabilities, including remote connectivity. Customers can now remotely control the instrument, monitor status and perform diagnostic tests, provide a new level of convenience for busy lab managers and chemists. With our intelligent predictive technology, we can also provide our customers with system health alerts or autonomous monitoring of instrument performance, allowing them to avoid unscheduled downtime and maximize laboratory productivity. These are just great examples of our digital lab strategy in action. Complimenting the introduction of Intovo GC in 2016, we now have the most complete and compelling gas chromatography portfolio in the industry. While early in the global launch of these two new offerings, customer response is very positive. We continue to strengthen our fast growing cell analysis business. Building from our beachhead  acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience in 2015 we acquired Luxcel Biosciences last year adding new cell assay capability. We continue to invest in the fast growing cell analysis market space. Earlier this quarter, we opened a state-of-the-art cell assay development facility in Cork, Ireland. We also acquired ACEA Biosciences in Q1 adding highly complementary new products to our cell analysis portfolio. The acquisition of ACEA Biosciences increases the relevance and impact we could have with our customers in this quickly evolving space. LSAG\\'s innovation leadership again received external recognition as we drive for increased market share in molecular spectroscopy. The Analytical Scientist ranked the Agilent 8700 LDIR system as a 2018 top innovation. This groundbreaking imaging spectroscopy system takes a new approach of chemical imaging to our customers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, food and material science markets. The system delivers greater speed and clarity enabling faster, more informed decisions for customers. These new products from our LSAG team further strengthened an already impressive line of instrumentation software. We are very well positioned for continued market share gains. Our Agilent CrossLab Group delivered excellent results growing 10% on a core base of the Q1. Demand was broad based across all end markets and regions which speaks to the strength of our customer value proposition. Our ACG team continues to expand our digital capabilities for lab and improve the customer experience. We introduced e-subscriptions and a lot of customers set up recurring to consumable orders online. This provides customer the ease and convenience of not having to place repeated orders. We also launched a smart alert subscription service for the GC installed base to provide lab managers with alerts on instrument maintenance needs based on actual applications and sample volume. Over the past several years ACG has worked diligently on the expanse of our portfolio of building outcome oriented solutions and enabling our online business. Our Q1 results are reflective of all the ACG team work today to bring these capabilities to market and set us up well for continued growth in the future. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered exceptionally strong results this quarter with 12% core revenue growth. Demand was strong across all businesses and regions. Our pathology related businesses which comprise roughly half the Diagnostics and Genomics business  grew low double-digits in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to partner with our customers in efforts to fight cancer. This quarter we expanded our portfolio in high-volume cancer diagnostic testing. In Europe, we launched the first PD-L1 pharmDx kit on the Dako OMNIS automated platform. We are also working on bringing this PD-L1 assay and OMNIS to the U.S. and other markets. Our NGS related business again grew double-digits this quarter. The NASD business is also very strong. Our plan is to bring the second facility online to expand production remain on track. We anticipate the initial production of GMP grade APIs by the end of fiscal 2019 with material revenue contributions in FY 2020. Looking at Agilent\\'s performance on a geographic basis the Americas led with high single-digit growth and with low single-digit growth in Europe and China. As we expected, China\\'s Q1 growth rate is lower than our expectations for full year growth. This is owing to an extremely tough compare versus a 19% core growth last year. As you know, there has been a lot of conversation about the China market. While there are some puts and takes within the markets we serve, our view is that the overall market demand remains solid. Now turning to the company outlook, the total company outlook, our Q1 results coupled with our current view of market conditions and Agilent\\'s strong execution capabilities set us up to deliver a strong 2019. As a result, we have increased our full year guidance. Bob will share the specifics, but before I hand over the call to Bob, let me close with a few summary comments. Looking ahead, I remain cautiously optimistic, cautious as we observe the overall macro conversations about the ongoing U.S.-China trade discussion and questions about the health of the China and European economies and optimistic as we continue to see solid demand in both end markets and geographies as we continue to successfully build a high growth, high margin recurring revenue business across our ACG and DGG Groups, and as we continue to strengthen and expand our LSAG instrument and software portfolio. The Agilent team is delivering on its commitments to drive superior revenue and earnings growth. Our company has never been stronger. The guidance increase reflects our confidence in the strength of the Agilent business our One Agilent team. Thank you for being on the call today. Thank you for the indulgence of our transmission difficulties and I look forward to addressing your questions later in the call. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today I will provide some revenue detail, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then I\\'ll finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Mike mentioned, we delivered a strong Q1, so a good start to the fiscal year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.28 billion with core revenue growth of 6.1% exceeding our guidance. Reported growth was also 6% as currently negatively impacted growth by 220 basis points and was offset by M&A contributing 210 basis points of growth. Mike spoke to the business group\\'s performance for the quarter, so I will provide some additional details around our end markets and regional performance. Pharma, our largest end market delivered 10% core growth. Growth was broad based across all business groups. We are seeing traditional strength in biopharma but also in newer strategic focus areas such as cell analysis. We are excited about the addition of ACEA Biosciences, which expands our portfolio in this fast growing segment of the market. In addition, a strong performance at NASD contributed to the results. Chemical and energy core growth was 2% against a very strong comparison of 13% last year and was in line with expectations. Instrument sales were effectively flat versus mid-teen gains last year while services and consumables delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. Environmental and forensics was up 10% even as we faced a top low teens compare last year. Double-digit growth in ACG and high single-digit growth LSAG were driven by strength in GCMS, GC, atomic spectroscopy, consumables and services. And wrapping up our end markets, diagnostics and clinical core revenue grew 11% while both academia and government and food were effectively flat. Geographically as Mike mentioned, we saw growth in all markets. The Americas region delivered high single-digit core growth as our commercial team continues to execute at a high level while Asia outside of China grew low double digits. Both Europe and China grew low single-digits against difficult comparison of 9% and 19% respectively. Now before I leave revenue, I want to mention we continue to be pleased with our evolving revenue mix as non-instrument revenue contributed 57% of total sales in the quarter. This revenue has been higher growth and historically less cyclical revenue. Its contribution this quarter is more than 1 percentage point higher than Q1 of last year. We expect this trend to continue as we leverage our large and growing installed base and provide value-added services and solutions for our customers. Now let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. Q1 gross margin was 56.9% and increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Our teams have been able to offset the higher cost of tariffs with productivity improvements. Operating margin was 23.1% up 120 basis points mainly due to topline leverage on operating expenses even as we invested more in R&D. Now before I leave operating margins, I want to remind you this fiscal year we adopted the new pension accounting standard and have restated prior years for comparison purposes. As a reminder, there is no net impact to our non-GAAP earnings per share. Consistent with our guidance, our Q1 tax rate was 17%, down a point versus a year ago and average diluted shares were 322 million. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the first quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. Now before moving on to FY \\'19 guidance, I want to touch on a few additional metrics on cash flow and the balance sheet. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $174 million up 12% from $155 million last year. We deployed $375 million in capital with $248 million in M&A associated with ACEA we returned $52 million to shareholders in dividends and purchased 1.1 million shares for $75 million. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in debt. Now let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter of 2019. For Q2 we are expecting revenue to range from $1.255 billion to $1.27 billion representing reported growth of 4.1% to 5.3% and core growth of 5% to 6%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of 290 basis points partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 200 to 220 basis points of growth. Second quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $.72 per share which is 7.7% to 10.8% reported growth. And based on a strong quarter and updated exchange rates we are also updating our full-year guidance in both revenue and EPS. We are updating our full-year revenue guidance to a range of $5.15 billion to $5.19 billion up $20 million on both low-end and high-end of the range and representing 4.8% to 5.6% reported growth. This reflects our Q1 performance as well as the benefit from our prior guidance associated with currency although it is still roughly 180 basis point headwind for the year. As a result, we\\'re still expecting core revenue growth in line with 5% to 5.5%. In addition, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.03 to $3.07 representing growth excluding currency of roughly 10% to 11% and reported growth of 8.6% to 10% up a full point from previous guidance. Consistent with Q1 this is based on a 17% tax rate for the full year and full year average diluted shares of $322 million. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, this guidance includes both upsides and downsides, so I would encourage you to model at the midpoint of the guidance at this stage. Before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying, we are very pleased with our Q1 results. Our start to the year and our continued hard work and focus of the Agilent team puts us in a strong position to achieve our goals for the year. Of course.  Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great, thanks guys. Maybe just to start on the LSAG growth, it came in a little below where we were expecting, I certainly understand the tough comp from last year. Can you just talk to how that tracked relative to your internal expectations and also the go forward, clearly the comp in 2Q quite a bit easier in that segment, so maybe just help us think about the quarter and then the go forward there? Yes Patrick, a great question and before I go to the answer I just want to extend my apologies to all on the phone and I understand we had some transmission difficulties earlier on the call, so hopefully it is now coming through loud and clear, but we will make sure that we address all your questions in case we weren’t clear throughout the call. Yes, relative to the LSAG growth, I think you hit on one of themes right off the bat which is the top compare. So we were expecting growth to moderate to low single digits versus this touch compare and I would point out that we had good pockets of strength in Pharma and environmental forensics. I would say there was some noise in the quarter particularly in January with the U.S. shutdown and some China trade rhetoric. There was probably some transitory impact really hard to tell exactly how much. But I think the look forward is probably is perhaps the most interesting thing which is we see good underlying business demand. The hope that came through in the scratching this up my narrative, we\\'re expecting our growth rates to rebound in Q2 not only because of the comps get easier but you\\'ve got this underlying strong business demand and we have a number of very new exciting launches underway and these launches will be delivering the revenue in the second quarter. Okay, that\\'s helpful. And then maybe just staying on the 2Q guide, maybe one for Bob, just given that the comp eases by I think 500 bps quarter-over-quarter relative to 1Q, the guidance calling for only 5% to 6% growth, can you maybe just talk through some of the moving pieces there and why we shouldn’t see an uptick in growth, just some conservatism baked in on your part? Yes, hey Patrick, thanks for the question. I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of as Mike mentioned we\\'re kind of cautiously optimistic. We do have an easier comp in Q2 and we\\'ve also reflected a higher guide at the midpoint for Q2 relative to what we had guided to in Q1. As we think about it, we are still expecting performance in ACG and DGG. LSAG we do expect to improve in Q2, but we\\'re being cautious a bit on some of the forecast and when we think about things like chemical and energy those are areas that we potentially have upside going into not only Q2 but Q3 and Q4 as well. Yes, Bob I think this is probably the highest quarterly Q2 growth that we\\'ve ever given in our history, so while it may be an element of conservatism relative to historical guide this is the highest we\\'ve ever guided. Thanks for the color, good to hear your voice not in sort of funny tone, so maybe just ticking off your comment on China, obviously there is a lot of things at stake in sort of getting this trade deal done and it seems like it is heading in the right directions, but maybe it is a bit later than what they had foreshadowed. I guess how are you thinking in general about what parts of the business could see maybe on the cap equipment side is the negativity and help explain maybe a little bit more tease out what you saw in January? So it is tough with you guys because it is sort of a non-traditional quarter end sort of extrapolate. But help us understand sort of what you are expecting over the next quarter and then against that sort of the underlying strength that still seems to sort of exist in most parts of the business in that region given sort of the commitments they have made on the environmental side, et cetera? Yes, absolutely Ross a great question and I\\'m glad to hear we\\'re coming through much more clearer and do appreciate the recognition of the kind of unusual timing of when we report relative to others in the industry. But specific to China and then maybe I\\'ll just give you kind of an overall narrative on China and get to your specific question. So when we were guiding for this quarter we expect our growth moderate to low digits really given the tough compares and a 19% growth last year and we continue to see really strong demand in Pharma and environmental. I think that environment demand really speaks to your commentary about the continued funding that exist in China relative to their priorities and this as mentioned here I will cover in a minute C&E, but last year our C&E business grew I think 34% just I think one. Relative to food, I would say, you know puts and takes of thinking in my narrative, but we are seeing a slower rebound than anticipated in the food market, but we do expect our food business to return to growth later this year and we can dig around in some more detail later if you like on that one. But I think really kind of the outlook is really the most important point here again which is, we\\'re expecting a stronger Q2 growth rate which are some small all long in terms of our guide because the good underlying demand is there. And as the comps easily move into Q2 you may recall Q2 results last year and then and that’s the narrative around was a fundamental change in our business in China which turned out not to be the case within over a double-digit growth last year. But I think if you look in Q2 you got the comp easing. You\\'ve got this continued strong underlying demand and we have new product launches that might turn into revenue in Q2. I do think that the continued to drag out if you will of the China tariff discussions between the U.S. and China, put the level of uncertainty in the marketplace and may be perhaps those customers who have more export driven activity which is relatively the only part of business might be holding back a bit. I think that – eliminating that cloud of uncertainty would certainly help but despite that, we still see really good demand in China. I think on that and Ross, just to add, I think both on the ACG side as well as the DGG side, those businesses continue to remain robust really leveraging that installed based and so I think when we think about China we think that long term the growth is certainly there. We\\'re continuing to invest in China and expect growth in excess of the total company average over the course of the year. Yes, hey Bob, thanks for jumping on the answer as well, because you may recall in some of our earlier discussions we\\'ve statistically highlighted the underrepresentation we have in our ACG and DGG businesses in China and the view that they were really poised to have a lot of long flung, just sort of long runway with all terms of exceptional growth and we\\'ve seen that through this year so far. That\\'s helpful. And maybe just tease out for us kind of how to think about DGG over the course of the year obviously LSAG very late in the year did ramp, but it feels like underlying given some of the acquisitions you\\'ve done there, given some share that feels like is going in new direction, that business could remain elevated, maybe not at this exact level every quarter, but certainly for a lot of the year, just help us sort of understand kind of your expectations for how that business will trend and how it did versus your internal plan, because this feels like a very good trend for the DGG folks? Yes, and Ross you are spot on. Your characterization of what\\'s going on is I\\'d have to wholeheartedly agreed to that we\\'ve got good momentum in our core pathology business and we could see some of the momentum building in the latter part of 2018 across the three dimensions of Sam\\'s business and we see the good momentum and our pathology piece, we\\'ve been highlighting to the audience our continued strength in our NGS business which and then consistently have been bringing in the pieces to complement that through acquisition plus also to continue organic investments we have in our genomic business and then I think the legitimate business. And then I think the NASD story is fairly well known already, but you can see why we were so anxious to continue in our  business and we\\'re seeing growth now and we\\'re feeling pretty good about where this business is going. So anything perhaps I missed? No Mike, I think you hit the nail on the head. We have a positive momentum going and the inorganic parts are well known, but I think I also would share that last year\\'s Analyst Investor Day and excited that upcoming next week at the AGBT conference we\\'ll be formally unveiling the Magnus NGS Library Prep, sample prep system so there\\'s a number of good things happening in DGG. Hey, thanks. Maybe just a followup on a couple of those on China, you know the C&E strength you\\'ve talked about for a while there, how much of the strength in China for C&E do you think kind of offset broader C&E softness? And then can you kind of quantify that the food ministry catch up you are expecting this year from the issues last year? Yes, Tycho it is good to hear from you and happy to address the question. So just to clarify, the C&E business for Q1, actually China was not a very strong contributor to the growth in Q1 that we saw in C&E. What we\\'re referring to was a strong growth rate last year of 34%. That being said as you know we remain very bullish on the prospects of the chemical and energy business in China and I would just say they are just all about the comps. And perhaps waiting for this new product to hit the market, so as you know the 8890 GC and perhaps we will have you share a few comments about that in a minute Jacob, but the 8890 GC is primarily targeted at the chemical and energy space. So we expect in the latter part of this year the China chemical and energy business we think is really a  going on here to be fundamentally strong. So I would not have reacted during the first quarter actually a story of tough comps. And the story in the food market, as you may recall last year we had talked about, hey we think this reorganization is going to take probably nine months or so to kind of go through the system, I think we got that part of it right which was they were going through process of consolidating into one set of industry, from multiple agencies into one single agency. So that has happened pretty much that\\'s essentially complete with most but not all the leaders in place. What I think is taking a little bit longer is the internal review of elimination of redundancies across our modern labs, so that\\'s really leading to slower to new instrument purchases in the – if you will the central government segment of that market. So this is really affecting the China central lab purchases while the private sector piece of it, the contract testing lab throughout the market continues to grow and we do expect the entire food business inclusive of the central agencies to be back growing again lateral this year. Yes, certainly, and back on to the chemical and energy you are absolutely right Mike that we continue to see lot of programs in place and projects in place for – in China. So we expect a lot of opportunities in that space also going forward as I also mentioned last time. But we are of course very excited about the new 88 series, not only is it what we call the smart connect and really we\\'ve put a new class in of smart connected instrument and which is a key component in our digital lab strategy. But what also gives us now is a great opportunity for the huge installed base we have out there with the 7080s we have a very strong start throughout and refresh the installed base. Now everybody would like to upgrade to an even better solution. It is well known technology, so you can very easily transfer your methods from the 7080 over to the 8080, but there is a lot of new features we have added into this. All the technology we have invested in Intuvo is now coming to full effects here and all the units smart connect what we talked about, first of all you can have the remote monitoring, but yes, really we have built in a dual core processor and what it does really is that it allows you to continuously having one processor continues to monitor the health of the instrument which allows you to really understand what is going on, get the smart alerts so you can really upfront understand what\\'s happening. You can reduce your unscheduled downtime and this is a huge opportunity for the labs out there. So we are really excited and I can tell you our customer is at least as excited as we are right now, we see a lot of demand for it. Yes, and Tycho the discussion we\\'re having inside the company is this has been a decade in the making. Yours truly actually was the GM when we came out with the 7890 product which hit the market in 2007. So you can see the amount of advancement made since that time and how we\\'re leveraging the initial investments we made in Intuvo GC platform. Okay and then if we think about the current quarter, I appreciate the color you\\'ve provided on guidance, any impact from Chinese Lunar New Year? And then you mentioned the government shutdown, we\\'ve heard one of our peers talk about ICP-MS impact there, any impact on your business there? Sure, happy to talk about also, for the first time in a number of years we\\'re not talking about Chinese New Year in our earnings call so nothing unusual happened this year relative to the dates moved around between quarters and obviously it moves the numbers around for compare, so nothing unusual happened relative to the business flow if you will as a result of the Chinese New Year. And I mentioned some of the noise around the U.S. Government shutdown. I\\'d mention two things. First of all just a reminder, when you look collectively at the entirety of all the U.S. Government agencies, U.S. Government is our largest customer and they were basically out of pocket for months. And I think what you may be pointing to Tycho, with some of the products require an export license from the U.S. Government, so obviously that didn\\'t happen. And some of that product didn\\'t find its way into China into Q1 because we didn\\'t have the export license. That\\'s just a transitory thing. We\\'ll see that flow through and overall it is really, really immaterial to the company\\'s quarterly results. Thank you. Another question on geography, can you comment on how the results in Europe arrived versus your internal expectations? Yes, Dan. It was good to hear from you, right where we thought it would be as we came in to this year we were expecting low single digit growth in Europe and I think it\\'s really been on that pace as well. So I don\\'t think really anything unusual there. Obviously, we\\'d love to see some resolution on some of the political uncertainty, but I think the numbers basically came in as planned. Bob? Okay. And then for my followup, I appreciate all the color on the new gas chromatography launches, can you help us understand the anticipated adoption curve there? Is this something similar to the Intuvo where it\\'s very slow and steady at the outset bell curve shaped or is this something where we could see a more immediate impact within the scope of 2019? Thank you. Dan, I\\'m so glad you asked that question. So this is actually a much different scenario. We can expect a quicker ramp of orders here and in fact but Jacob I think we\\'re actually starting to ship right? Yes, we did sponsorship this week here, so this is happening. We, as I mentioned before it\\'s based on our proven technology and so it\\'s very easy to transfer methods. Actually you don\\'t have to do anything, so you would actually expect most customers, that was looking for 70, 80 probably pretty quickly move over to 88. We do see some customers that are conservative that is a production that want to wait maybe a few months, but this… Yes and we still have a lot of conviction on the game changer Intuvo GC, but we do see the adoption rate to be here much more quickly than the Intuvo ramp because there\\'s really a direct replacement with new capabilities for our 1790 and 7820 offerings. Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, can you speak to the services growth in the first quarter and perhaps some of the tractions you might be seeing with the multi vendor services in China? Yes, so I\\'m going to make a few comments here, then I\\'m going to invite Mark to join in on the call to sort of take a bow in front of the investment community. So we\\'re seeing great traction in the overall ICG business and services and in China in particular. So I think it is all regions and across the entire portfolio. So this has been the results of a lot of work over the last several years really to provide to the marketplace a set of offerings that really helps them with running their operations of the lab and also with the great science they\\'re doing, so we think we\\'ve got momentum. We think this wasn\\'t just a one quarter phenomena and our outlook is pretty positive here. So Mark, anything else you\\'d add to that? Thanks Mike and I\\'ll add a couple of things. As you suggested we\\'ve seen strong growth not just in what we\\'ve talked about in our enterprise or multi vendor arena, but in our instrument services business. Both of them were double-digit growers in this particular quarter and maybe a bit nuanced about the portfolio expansion. So as Mike talked the value-added services that now are more formulated around specific end markets and in Jacobs business in particular and the extension of a lot of the capabilities we actually talked to an aide in terms of how we\\'re going to introduce an expanding portfolio around our CrossLab Connect and asset monitoring utilization services. As far as China is concerned, I\\'m extremely bullish about China still. I think we\\'re - I know you\\'d like to talk about which innings we\\'re in, I still think we\\'re in the early innings in China in the enterprise space. And it\\'s really ripe in the sense that they\\'re looking for many of the same things we\\'ve seen across our global accounts and they have the size and scale of the assets in the lab now to do things with it. So very encouraging in China and I think we\\'ll see in the foreseeable future will be strong growth there. And then a quick follow up for Bob, can you just help us bridge the core incremental operating margin year-over-year in the first quarter in terms of the impact of FX, M&A, tariffs on the incremental year-over-year? Thank you. Yes. So yes let me give you a couple of data points there. So the majority of the operating margin expansion was through our operating expense. The tariffs were about roughly $4 million in the quarter which was in line with what we had expected. So year-over -year that\\'s a $4 million kind of headwind. M&A, if you include the Lasergen was also about $3 million or $4 million all in a reduction year-over-year as well. And then the tariffs were offset by productivity enhancements and gross margin and you saw that. And then the R&D we actually spent more in R&D, but we\\'re able to offset that through productivity savings and our SG&A through our Agilent programs. And so, that hopefully gives you kind of a sense for the 120 basis points improvement. It was really on top - on the strength of the top line driving leverage in our core operating expenses as well as being able to offset that tariffs and the investments that we\\'re making in R&D and the new businesses really driving more efficiencies in the G&A areas. Hey Bob, you did a little bit of share buyback activity in the quarter. Just sort of some commentary on maybe being a little bit more aggressive on that given your strong cash position and just sort of some general thoughts on capital deployment at this moment in time? Yes, so I\\'ve been with the company now for about six months and you know as I think about that we were active in the quarter. I can see us between M&A which is our primary focus of utilization of capital in the back half of the year between M&A and/or share repurchase I would expect us to be probably a little more active. That\\'s not built into the guide Derik. We prefer to use that cash and the strong balance sheet that we have on growth assets as we did over the course of the last 18 months, but we do not see ourselves continuing to hold a significant cash balance. And I guess along those lines, I mean you\\'ve done a number of deals in the genomic space recently in the cell biology space. I guess when you look at the portfolio are there any other target areas, things or I mean I\\'ve asked this question in the past and I\\'ll ask another version of it, but it\\'s like you are relatively underweight versus some of your peers in the academic and government market and just wondering if that\\'s a primary focus of your M&A activity? Yes, Derik, I\\'ll jump in on this one. So actually some of the deals we\\'ve done have been really targeted academic, whether it be Seahorse Biosciences, the iLab. So we like that space, but I\\'d say it\\'s more from a collective end market, market view. And so, I think you hit on a couple of areas that we\\'re interested in, the genomics and the cell analysis. Cell engineering is an area of interest for us. We also think there is things we can do on the ACG consumables portfolio and also remain very interested in informatics as well. So we think there\\'s a lot to be, luster out there that kind of fits our model of companies that are primarily in the private space that really would welcome being part of the Agilent culture. Let me just add something real quick there. I think the beauty of it is, I think as we look at our portfolio of funnel of opportunities it\\'s really across all three of our business groups, not just focused either on the genomic side or other places. And I think you\\'ve seen that through what we\\'ve been able to do really leveraging the strength of Agilent as you said and I guess your next question is around Lasergen. Yes, I got to say with AGBT coming up and just while thinking about the sequencing space can you give us an update on what\\'s going on at Lasergen and when can we expect to see some first data? Yes sure. I mean just I\\'ll start with a reminder Lasergen is important to us but it\\'s one of many R&D programs both within Agilent even within DGG. We are on track. We\\'re meeting our internal expectations. We\\'re really pleased with the progress that the team is making. You won\\'t hear anything specific that we\\'ll talk about at AGBT. We\\'re tracking along and more to come in the course of the coming years. I want to keep it going on DGG the growth there in the quarter which is great. The first factor you laid out was that NASD was the largest year-over-year contributor. So I\\'m curious where you\\'re finding incremental capacity at the old site and just update us on the timing related to the new capacity of the new site? Yes, so I might just go ahead and handle this one, you can jump in on it, but we brought in a new general manager probably about 24 months ago and really came in and looked at our existing facility and saw opportunities from we call our agile Agilent program, but from our process improvement we said, hey there is more that we can garner in terms of growth out of the existing facility by really changing some of the aspects of how we conducted the manufacture. I think we\\'ve been able to actually if you will squeeze more out of the existing sites than we had thought. And then relative to the status which is the same I think we\\'re still on track for bringing this on online by the end of this fiscal year in terms of producing GMP grade material. The site construction is essentially finished. We\\'re now in the midst of validation which is really quite a task given the scale of what we\\'ve constructed here, but still doing good. Yes, and Mike you said it all. We, operational excellence was in I think full order in Q1 and we\\'re making really good progress for opening of our second facility. Great. And just to followup I guess on the second factor which was the pathology business the double digit growth seems like a nice acceleration there. Can you talk about, what you\\'re seeing on the competitive environment and utilization of the instruments that are around in the field and maybe just finally, where do you think you stand with the question all out to that help in the quarter? You got it Mike. Overall the combination of our pathology related businesses, our core business that we have which is our systems are consumables to go along with it, including companion diagnostics, including we call reagent partnership, altogether a very, very strong quarter that we had. To answer some more of your specifics, we\\'re seeing you know really good performance related to our advanced staining portfolio. And as you indicated a lot of that we are seeing increased pull through and our core systems are on this platform is doing well. And you alluded to that we have seen the adoption and growing utilization at Quest, but there\\'s also a similar effect that we\\'re seeing at other major centers and we continue to see goodness from PD-L 1 and 2 in partnership that we have with a number the pharma partners that you\\'re aware of including Merck and BMS. So it\\'s not just one thing but there\\'s general strength across our pathology business that we\\'re pleased with. Jack, I think that was the thing that was probably one of the most gratifying, it was really across all of the business lines within DGG. It wasn\\'t being driven by one or just a handful, it was really across, it was a nice performance. Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. Just curious what did China grow excluding the food headwinds and then what are you expecting for China growth for the rest of the year? So I think the growth for - outlook for total China is the same as it was at the beginning the year which was above the overall corporate average I think high single digits is what we\\'ve been probably looking at. Yes and I would say you will get the exact number but it would have been mid single digits ex food. Okay and then as we approach the Brexit deadline and given you uniquely have a month of that impact in your second quarter if the timeline holds. Can you just remind us of your exposure to the UK and any areas of your business that could be impacted by the exit? I think Bob, I recall it is about 4% of our total businesses in the UK from I discussed in the last year and the main flow through would be getting product into my main major impact I\\'ll be getting product into the UK for - to our UK based customers and we actually have a series of contingency plans, we\\'re actually already executing on which assumes a hard Brexit. So we\\'re planning for worst case scenario which means making sure we have in country stocks and other things to help our customers with potential challenges getting in product through customs. We do have a relatively small factory in the UK for our Raman spectroscopy business, but we\\'re in the midst of transforming that product into Malaysia. So I think from the outbound export side of things probably would be not a good start right Jacob? So I think the bottom line there is, I think we\\'ve got good plans in place. We\\'re not expecting that to have a material impact in the quarter. Hi, good afternoon. Two questions for you. First I guess just as it relates to tariffs, I heard you say you saw a $4 million impact in the quarter. I was just wondering if you were assuming the tariff to step up to 25% in your initial guidance there or what are you thinking about tariffs as of right now over the remainder of the year? And then I have a followup question related to some products. Yes, great, thanks Steve. Yes, so we are assuming that it will ramp back up to 25% at the end of March and then for the rest of the year. And so, we built that into to our guidance. So if something happens there this - such a trade either gets delayed, that would be potential upside for us. I think more importantly just removing the uncertainty of what that looks like I think we\\'ll free the market just in general and it\\'s probably less about the dollars associated with the tariffs and more associated with just kind of clarity about what path we\\'re going to be going forward. Sure. That\\'s helpful. And then secondly just on products, could you provide a little bit more color on kind of your GC portfolio now and with these new 88 systems kind of where the Intuvo offsets versus these newer systems. And then also just with this new Magnus system maybe how that fits into your existing genomic portfolio and what you\\'re expecting out of that product over the rest of the year? Yes, that\\'s a good question and now we have - we really have three main solutions in the GC space. We have the Intuvo which really goes after the ultimate ease of use with hyperactivity especially combined with mass spec, so that\\'s that great area for the routine use with Intuvo. Then we have the 8860 which is focusing more on a routine application which are more of the standard ones, but also demands some type of ease of use and allow us also to play in the midrange space. And then the 8890 which is the high - where we have customers requiring high flexibility and performance that needs very high requirements and performance in the space which is really HPI space and other elements that\\'s where its more complex. So these are really the three areas we play it\\'s all now based on the same core technology with smart connectivity and remote access and all those built-in health monitoring capabilities, so it fits very well together. And the same ease of use platform. Yes, with respect to the Magnus, thank you for the question. Well, first of all what we\\'re going to be providing the system is something that we don\\'t have and actually there\\'s very few solutions like it on the market specifically the customer is going to be able to start with a shared DNA and that\\'s what they put into our automated prep system and what they get on the other end is a fully prepared library that\\'s ready to go that they can load. And so, what that means specifically is we\\'re doing both the library preparation and the target enrichment fully in an automated fashion in our Magnus system. Like I mentioned before, we\\'re going to formally launch this next week at the AGBT conference and then we\\'ll start taking orders immediately thereafter. But our shipments will be in a deliberate fashion starting in the June, July timeframe, making sure for our first set of customers we really get a lot of care to ensure the success that they would expect that we\\'d expect. So it is targeted to clinical labs and other NDS testing labs and I think we\\'ll definitely see some impact of installs by the end of this year, but really a bigger impact in 2020. The question I have is, I get the strong compare on chemical energy, but I just wanted to get a sense, I\\'m wondering if you saw any impact from customers waiting and knowing about 8890 and 8860 and holding back those purchases and having any impact in the quarter? And then also I have a followup for Bob on margins, thank you. So Puneet, I think you must have been listening very carefully to my comments, the slight, the scratching is coming through. So I kind of alluded to that which is and it\\'s hard to put a quantitative number on it, but we clear things that happened which is, this product has been 10 years in the making, a decade in making I\\'d like to say and of course our customers knew it was coming and I think some may choose, as Jacob mentioned, to go with the 7890 right now because they are there they still want to see the new product, but we think that there was a quick uptake in 8090. So that may, I think that is part of the story, can\\'t quantitate  it, but also again one of the reasons why we were optimistic about our ability to get some good growth and back to growth in the chemical energy beyond what we saw in Q1. So I think there\\'s more to the story than the tough compares. Thanks, so we should expect this to come, I mean come in into the next quarter now that you\\'re shipping this out? Yes, yes, yes, that in fact Jacob just dropped me a note the other day and we started shipping this week. Okay great. And then Bob, just some I wanted to get a sense from you on, you commented about 57% being consumables recurring moving up by a point and sort of gross margin contribution there. I wanted to understand, now that you have had some time to look at the overall portfolio and the new products and Intuvos and 8890s and what\\'s your sort of gross margin expectations sort of longer term, obviously these are, they have improving margin profiles, so I\\'m just trying to get a sort of a high level corporate view that you\\'re seeing in gross margin improvement longer term? Thank you. Yes, I mean I think if you look over the course of the last couple of years we\\'ve had significant gross margin improvement really through the great work that the operations team has been able to drive. And then also the pricing discipline that the commercial teams have been able to do as well as positive mix. This quarter you saw that moderate really because of the tariffs and if it weren\\'t for tariffs we would\\'ve had I think some very good gross margin improvement. I think once we anniversary gross margin, the tariffs this year which would be in Q4 you\\'ll start to see gross margins go back up for the things that you talked about as well as just the ongoing operational improvements that we have. We had guided to call it modest, call it 50 to 70 bps on a restated basis operating margin improvement, a combination of both gross margin and an operating expense improvement for the full year. In Q1, we were ahead of the game which is good news and a lot of that came through the operating expenses, but I would expect us to probably be about this range and probably be a little stronger in the back half of the year as we anniversary the tariffs on gross margin. But going forward, I would see us really focus on growth driving margin expansion in that 50 to 70 basis points being kind of evenly split between the gross margins and operating expense line. Hi, this is Ryan out for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Another great Pharma quarter. Can you remind us what proportion of your Pharma revenues are now to large molecule customers? And contrary to recent quarters you didn\\'t call out small molecule growth within Pharma. Can you talk about what you\\'re seeing from those customers and is healthy growth within the small molecule segment finally slowing down a bit or is that a little premature? Yes, Ryan so great observation. So the ratios have changed somewhat over last three years. I think it speaks to the strength of not only the biopharma space, but how we\\'ve been picking up share. But to answer your question, it\\'s 80/20 mix about 80% small molecule 20% is the biopharma space and the slowdown in LC that\\'s already happened, we saw that in 2018 and as you know, we\\'ve been talking about the breadth of our portfolio and how a lot of our analysis has moved. It\\'s not the driven demand for LCs but it\\'s not the double digit growth we thought for a while with strong demand on the mass spec side. You may recall that was one of the reasons why we had such a blow after Q1 last year when we had a strong finish the prior year in LC/MS. So I think the breadth of the interim portfolio what\\'s going on in the in the ACG business in terms of our enterprise business as well as this is where a lot of our NASD growth shows up. And by the way I think you also have some new solutions coming out in this space as well Jacob right? Yes, what came out here recently was more for the small molecule, Mike and Q-TOF. So what we came out a year ago was the Q-TOF for the last molecule, we had advanced bio and we\\'ve had a lot of success with that coming out with a full solution. We\\'re now taking that technology and have focused that into to also address small molecules, within specifically within the food environmental market but also in the academia research. So the success we had where we started out in the biopharma and one of the first early movers into the biopharma space, particularly focused on discovery and R&D. We now, we of course will continue to invest into the biopharma space also going forward. Right. And that was perhaps more of an oversight in terms of calling out the  narrative with a 10% overall growth in pharma, small molecule also was healthy. Yes, very helpful. Thank you. And Bob you noted earlier in the call that you don\\'t expect to maintain a significant cash balance over time. Can you give us a sense for what significant means, how do you think about the minimum cash balance for the business and when should we expect to hear more on your plans to deploy your current excess cash? Thank you. Yes, I would say later on this year as I get through kind of the rhythms of the business in terms of as we get a better feel for that. What I would say right now is we\\'re in a net cash position. We actually used more cash than we generated in Q1. I would expect that to continue over time. I don\\'t see us using it all in one quarter, but we will continue to deploy our capital in a growth oriented way. We continue to drive dividend growth, but I think just as importantly and probably more importantly investments in faster growing areas to augment our strong portfolio already and then couple that with share buybacks. Good, you seem to be doing more M&A. Is that a change in philosophy? Is it a change in markets that you are perceiving? What\\'s behind this activity? Yes. Thanks for the question. So this is a conscious decision I made and we started sort of laying the foundation with Sam coming into that role and continuing now with a new hire in Eric Gerber. And what my view was when I first came into this role I really had to get the foundation this company established and I think we\\'ve got our core operations under control, we\\'ve got our pipelines, our R&D roadmaps redone. We\\'ve got a whole new way of operating the company or running this company. And you\\'ve seen it in the early years in terms of the results we delivered, but we also have this opportunity to use this great balance sheet we have to, as Bob described it to acquire growth assets. So I think the company from a foundational standpoint is in the position to be more acquisitive. I also believe that we have been building the muscles in terms of actually making the acquisitions work for the company. And we continue to work to get better at this and are very active in the market. I think we did a record number of acquisitions last year and you can start to see that it\\'s paying off in terms of material impact to our growth rate. Again our model doesn\\'t require M&A, but is a nice adder. And as Bob mentioned, I\\'ll just re-emphasize this, we\\'re looking to go into markets and acquire businesses where they can leverage the One Agilent model of innovation and where the acquired companies have something of a difference in nature, have a differential team and are in the segments of the market that are growing faster than the overall company. We passed on opportunities where assets were available and we didn\\'t really see a path to grow. We are a growth company and that\\'s the type of assets that we want to acquire. So it was a conscious decision and I think we plan on continuing to be active in the market. And lastly, could you give us a refresh on Lasergen. Is that going after the diagnostics market, what will be their position? Thanks so much for the questions. Yes, I think I know this one sort of go ahead and handle this one, but our strategy here is that right now we\\'re a component supplier into the NGS workflows of some of our major competitors and have built a business in excess of $250 million. Our view is that ultimately we see a view where you need routine market that you are going to need to have a turnkey easy to use workflow solution. We have a lot of the components of that already and you may recall that from Sam\\'s overview at our Analyst Day back last year. The missing piece was to actually have a sequencer. So our thoughts are not to compete box-to-box in the sequencer business, but really try to build the best workflow for that cancer diagnostics marketplace. Hey Mike. On chemical and energy, just honing in on your comments on instrumentation, I\\'m curious where you would put penetration or replacement for the Intuvo at this point and if you\\'d be willing, what do you think could be the contribution either at the segment level or for the overall business? Yes, so I think when you think about the chemical and energy market I think we want to primarily think around the 8890 and 8860 portfolio, because that really is the target market for this product and that\\'s why I went to great length in my narrative which probably nobody was able to hear because of our transmission difficulties, but that this really is right after the mainstream chemical and energy market, the Intuvo is really geared towards those high volume routine labs in food and environmental really a mass spec based analysis where the chemical and energy market tends to be more gas GC only kind of marketplace. So we\\'re really excited about the product. I won\\'t give you a specific number, but I can say this is one of I believe the proof points why we believe there perhaps is some upside to our current outlook on chemical and energy which believe, I think Bob we\\'ve got a low single digit for the year. Yes, and I think, Dan to your question, none of these individually is going to move the needle on the total company, but collectively the portfolio of new products that are being introduced, not only in LSAG, but across our portfolio is really what\\'s helping us sustain and feel confident that our growth is going to continue above market levels just because of the value proposition that these are able to provide in the marketplace. Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then Bob, if I could on the out margin forecast, it sounds like you\\'re on track operationally for the NASD build out. I\\'m just curious if you think the $12 million or so in investment that you\\'ve targeted last year as the 2019 spend holds? Yes. In general that is - that\\'s consistent with, we haven\\'t changed the forecast there relative to what we had said at the beginning of the year. All right. That wraps up the call for today. Thank you for joining. If you couldn\\'t get to something because of the transmission issues or have any of questions, please reach out to us in the Investor Relations. Thanks very much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\\'s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Agilent Technology Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode . Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, today\\'s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\\'s conference, Mr. Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Liz. And welcome, everyone to Agilent\\'s second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO and Bob McMahon Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob’s comments, will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-on-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of April 30th. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Ankur, and thanks for joining our call today. Our Q2 results are mixed. On one hand, we continue to deliver strong growth in two of our three businesses. On the other hand, our LSAG business is experiencing unexpectedly soft market conditions. Despite revenue below our expectations, the Agilent team delivered solid earnings with EPS of $0.71 at the midpoint of our guidance. This represents 9% EPS growth over last year. We also delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. For the quarter, total revenues were $1.24 billion, representing 4% core growth. Let me break that down; performance was led by our Agilent CrossLab Group with core growth of 9%; our Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 6% core growth, while our LSAG business declined 1%. There were two key market factors observed in the latter part of the quarter that contributed to the LSAG revenue shortfall; first, we experienced a slowing of internal orders in China; the second factor is tied to more general slowdown in orders from big pharma. I\\'d point out that this slowdown became apparent to us at the beginning of April. Let me explain this in little more detail. In China, our overall business grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in ACG. However, our LSAG business declined by 1% during the quarter. There are two major factors impacting our China LSAG business. First, the recovery in the food market has not yet materialized. Government labs have not yet resumed purchasing at the levels we have previously seen. Second, the Chinese government\\'s 4 + 7 initiative to lower generic drug prices is having a greater than expected impact on small molecule pharma. Consequently, we\\'re lowering our revenue expectations in China this year. China does, however, remain an important long-term growth market for us. The other factor affecting LSAG growth is moderating global demand in small molecule pharma. We\\'ve seen several large accounts delay and replace in purchases. In contrast, the small molecule pharma would continue to see strong global bio-pharma demand. While overall growth declined 1% there are positive signs in other LSAG end markets, demand remained strong in environment forensics and biopharma markets with solid results in chemical and energy. You\\'ll recall we strengthened our leadership in gas chromatography with the recent launch of the new 8860, 8890GCs. Since the launch, we were very pleased with the stronger than expected customer demand we\\'ve seen. We also have some other very exciting new products. In April, we introduced the new Agilent 6546 LC/MS Q-TOF system. This system is tailored to environmental, metabolomics research in food testing laboratories, providing ability to acquire high-resolution data across an unprecedented dynamic range. Customers can simply see more compounds and analyze them more correctly with this new offering. In addition during the quarter, we also introduced a unified purpose-built portfolio of SONOS products, targeting cancer immunotherapy with the addition of ACEA Biosciences. This offering enables research in this fast-growing segment. Our SONOS business continues to deliver double digit growth. While we\\'re facing soft market demand in our LSAG business, we remain confident in the strength of our portfolio and believe we are well positioned to continue wining in the market. Now, I would like to share more detail about the other two businesses. The Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver excellent results, growing 9% on a core basis. Demand is broad-based across all regions. This reflects the market-leading value of our portfolio and differentiated customer experience. In China, the ACG business grew in the mid-teens. The team continues to execute our strategy of leveraging Agilent\\'s large instrument installed base. We also continue to expand our services footprint in emerging cities, and tailor our consumer\\'s portfolio to local markets. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered a solid quarter with 6% core revenue growth. Regional demand is led by strength in the Americas. Our pathology related businesses grew high single-digits. Previously announced large competitive wins along with continued strong demand for our antibodies and our companion diagnostic services are driving our growth in that segment. Agilent also received expanded FDA approval for our PDL1 IHC companion diagnostic for metastic non-small cell lung cancer. This companion diagnostic would now be used to identify a broader range of patients who may qualify for first-line treatment with Keytruda. The NASD business continued delivering strong performance with mid-teens growth. We are on track to bring our second facility online. We anticipate the initial production of GMP grade APIs by the end of fiscal 2019. Material revenue contributions are expected in fiscal year 2020. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we\\'re confident that the momentum will continue in ACG and DGG businesses. For our LSAG business, our outlook for the second half is tempered by our view of continued soft market conditions. As a result, we have revised our outlook for the full year, reaffirming our prior EPS commitment while lowering revenue growth. Bob will describe this in more detail but first, just a few summary comments. We now expect to deliver core growth for the year between 4% and 5%. While we\\'re facing market headwinds in our LSAG business, our full year earnings guidance remains intact. The Agilent team remains firmly committed to meeting our current guidance for earnings growth. Our guidance reflects confidence in the strength of the overall Agilent business model and our ability to drive solid earnings results. Thank you for being on the call today and look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand the call to Bob. Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then I\\'ll finish up with our updated guidance for Q3 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. And percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Mike mentioned, we delivered solid Q2 earnings despite slower than anticipated top-line growth, underscoring the strength of Agilent\\'s financial model and our ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion with core quarter revenue growth of 4%. Reported growth was 3% as currency negatively impacted growth by 320 basis points, slightly higher than expected. This was partially offset by M&A contributing 190 basis points of growth. As Mike spoke to the business group\\'s performance for the quarter, I will provide some additional details around our end markets and regional performance. Pharma, our largest end market, delivered 2% core growth. We continue to see strength in biopharma and aftermarket services and consumables, and in our NASD business. However, the slowing of the instrument replacement cycle for small molecule applications led to a softer than expected result. Chemical and energy core growth was a strong 6%, above expectations and driven by strong low-teens growth in services and consumables. All regions grew led by strength in the Americas. Environmental and forensics was up 7%. Strength in forensics is linked to the ongoing global opioid crisis, which is driving demand for expanded forensic laboratory capabilities, more samples and broader screening requirements. The environmental market grew mid single-digits, and continues to be driven by an ongoing expansion of testing and oversight in China. Now wrapping up our end market discussion, core revenue for both diagnostics and clinical and academia and government, both grew 5%, while food declined 3% due to the softness in the China market. Geographically, we saw growth in all regions, led by the Americas with 6% growth as conditions in the U.S. continue to be healthy. Europe, with 4% growth, performed better than anticipated, driven by pharma outsourcing trends and continued strong biopharma investments. China grew 3%. And while we had strong mid-teens growth in the ACG business, softer instrument sales in the food market and small molecule pharma led to lower than expected overall results. Now before I leave revenue, the core growth of our combined LSAG and ACG businesses, while below our expectations, was 4% in the quarter. And we believe compares favorably to the overall analytical lab market growth. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q2 gross margin was 56% and increased 70 basis points compared to the prior year. We continue to achieve good gross margin improvements through our productivity initiatives, and driving continued economies of scale in our ACG services business. Operating margin was 21.9%, up 60 basis points, mainly due to discipline cost management as shifting market conditions became increasingly apparent in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, the tax rate was down marginally and average diluted shares were $321 million. This led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 in the second quarter, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year and at the midpoint of our guidance. Now, before moving to Q3 guidance and full year guidance, I want to touch on a few additional financial metrics on cash flow and on the balance sheet. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $213 million. We deployed $102 million in the quarter, consisting of $52 million in dividends and $50 million in share purchases, representing roughly 635,000 shares. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in debt. And during the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit line of $1 billion, which remains undrawn. With our strong balance sheet position, we will be more active in the second half of the year deploying capital. Specifically, we intend to deploy $500 million for share repurchases with the majority of that to come in the third quarter. This underscores not only our balance sheet strength, but also our confidence in the future. In addition, we still have plenty of capacity for M&A and we have an active business development funnel. Although, we will continue to remain disciplined in our approach. Now, let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the fiscal year. As Mike indicated, we\\'re reducing our core revenue growth outlook for the year. While our expectations for ACG and DDG aren\\'t changing, our forecasts for the second half is tempered by softening market condition in certain segments on the instrument side of the business. The developments in China, coupled with continued uncertainty on trade is creating a more challenging macro environment. As a result, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to a range of $5.085 billion to $5.125 billion representing 3.5% to 4.3% reported growth. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 210 basis points, partially offset by M&A. And as a result, we\\'re now expecting core revenue growth in the range of roughly 4% to 5%. Now despite reducing revenue guidance, we feel confident in holding to our full year earnings per share guidance range of $3.03 to $3.07, representing growth excluding currency of roughly 10% to 11% and reported growth of 8.6 to 10%. As Mike mentioned, our EPS guidance reflects confidence in the strength of Agilent\\'s business and our ability to drive earnings through multiple levers. These include disciplined expense management and the use of our balance sheet. Based on deploying the additional $500 million toward share repurchase, we are updating our average diluted share count down to $319 million for the year. Now finally, turning to the third quarter, we\\'re expecting revenue in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion, representing reported growth of 1.8% to 3.5% and core growth of 2.7% to 4.1%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of 210 basis points, partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 120 basis points to 250 basis points growth. Third quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 a share, which is 6% to 9% reported growth versus a year ago. The share count for Q3 is expected to be $317 million. Let me conclude by saying we are pleased with the team\\'s ability to preserve earnings performance despite shifting market conditions. We are confident in the strength of Agilent\\'s business and our ability to navigate softness in certain markets. With that, before opening up for questions, I will turn it back to Mike for some closing comments. Thanks Bob. I just want to add a few closing words before we move into Q&A. Great companies do not just react to market conditions, they see market opportunity. At Agilent, we will continue to drive productivity and double down our efforts to be a more agile company. We have marginal levers to drive earnings, including disciplined expense management and use of our balance sheet. However, we are not going to expense to cut our way to grow. We will continue to bring innovative new products to market and aggressively compete for market share.  Our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. So first question, trying to make sure I understand the issues in small molecule pharma. Is that an LC comment specifically, or more broadly customers you\\'re labeling as small molecule pharma? And can you comment on the trends between ethical pharma and in generics? So I will make a few comments and then, Jacob, feel free to jump on this. I think it\\'s primarily LC related, and it’s a situation we\\'re seeing actually globally. I called out specifically the government initiative in China. We also saw in our large pharma accounts in U.S. and Europe this delays in purchasing. In fact, I remember talking with our European field manager. We had an order that was supposed to close in January with big European pharma company it was pushed out, we thought it was going to close at the end of March and now this closed in May. And perhaps you can add your thoughts here as well, Jacob. No, you\\'re absolutely, Mike, that that is primarily the LC business. However, many of those pharma companies also have investment into some other areas and when they now see some chances in the generics, they might put back also in other areas. So LC is a prime focus, but it certainly also expands into mass spec. And I think just to close this off. Dan, I think the comments for China were specific to generics. I think globally, we saw both in ethical and generic drugs in small molecule side. And then, Mike, my follow up. Can you elaborate just further on the actions you\\'re taking to respond to the market softness? And I ask because the detrimental margins in LSAG were pretty high. So can you elaborate a bit on what you\\'re doing to react? Thank you. So as Bob mentioned in his call notes, we\\'re actually quite pleased by the action of the team to really rapidly adjust the cost structure in a phenomena developed probably over the last four to six weeks of the quarter. And the actions are just double downing on the agile Agilent programs that we had already in flight, but also really making sure that we looked at the expenses that weren\\'t directly related to growth and really able to call to action to pull back on things that really don\\'t drive growth, like internal travel, for example. So we pulled all the levers we could. But while maintaining intact our coverage model in the field, as well as our MPI programs. And Bob, I don\\'t know if you have anything to add? I would just add, Dan. While the LSAG business did show a decline year-over-year, I would remind you to look at the total company, which actually did improve margins for year-over-year and for the 17%. So we operate this as a full company its part of the One Agilent approach. And so we\\'re taking a number of initiatives. But as Mike said, we\\'re also doubling down on areas, such as the new products in the areas where we think we can drive. We did see pockets of strength in LSAG and Jacob and team are really focusing on those areas; areas such as cell analysis and chemical and energy, and some of the other areas as well. So it\\'s not just an expense, it is really ensuring that we\\'re focused on the areas that we have the fastest opportunities for growth. So I\\'m going to follow up on some of the pharma questions. When we did the CEO call back in early April, you did call out the China generic headwinds. We didn\\'t really hear about the pharma delays at that point. So obviously, it seems like it came up later in the quarter. And you mentioned it was several accounts. So can you maybe just talk on how widespread it is? And is this a transitory issue in your mind, or how you\\'re thinking about pharma for the remainder of the year? Thanks for the excellent question, Tycho. And I do recall our conversations. I think it was in early April. And I had just come back from China and we were first hearing about the four by seven initiatives in China. And to your question, I think that we saw it fairly broad based, this is outside of China. So I think China\\'s got some specific things happening relative to the government actions around for 4 plus 7, which I think are fairly publicized, but we saw that both our U.S. and European customers. And we just had a major account review and all of our major accounts were down year-over-year. And there\\'s just a level of caution relative to replacing investments in the small molecule side of businesses, The same companies, however, are investing quite heavily in the biopharma side. So it\\'s a sort of a tale of two cities from the standpoint of what\\'s really going well inside some of our larger accounts versus where there\\'s been a pause. And Bob, I know you\\'ve looked at this quite closely as well. I don’t know if you have anything else to add to that? No, I think you\\'re right, Mike. And Tycho, as we\\'re thinking about the guidance going forward in the second half of the year, we are looking at probably a more moderated growth for pharma going forward. But still not at the rate at that we saw in Q2 but probably in the mid single digit where we were expecting probably high single digits globally. So I think we\\'re taking a prudent approach there as we are thinking about the outlook for the year. I would say that we\\'re continuing to, as Mike said, grow our biopharma business. But we still have the proportion, a large proportion of our pharma business being in the small molecule side. I would just add, Tycho, one thing we have seen though is on the small molecule side, there still is very high demand for chemistries and services. And I think you\\'ve seen that reflected in the strong ACG results. And it was a little surprising to see food down, now that you\\'ve anniversaried it. Can you maybe just -- and I know it\\'s not recovering, but is it getting worse? This has surprised us well. It\\'s not getting any worse; it\\'s just not getting any better. And we had anticipated coming on the anniversary that the central government will start reinvesting at the previous level and the spends just are not there. Now we\\'re seeing in other parts of the end markets, so the spends and investments in environmental are quite strong. But they\\'ve not yet returned to the spending levels that we had seen prior in the food market. But again, I would say the same story here relative to the aftermarket flows. We are still seeing strong growth on the aftermarket flows in food; it\\'s just the instrument purchases aren’t there. So it\\'s not getting any worse but it\\'s not getting better as we had thought. And then one just last clarification on the cost side. Are you taking any additional tariff remediation efforts given round three, just curios? We continue to be focused on additional remediation to minimize that, the increase between the round three from the 10% up to the 25% is incorporated into our guidance. It was a -- I\\'ve talked about this before, it\\'s roughly about $750,000 to $1 million in the second half of the year, net of the efforts that we\\'re taking. Just some clarity around some of the slowing you saw beginning in April. In the last call you talked about January being slow. So maybe just talk us through the cadence of the quarter, particularly in China? Were February and March trending okay and then you\\'ve got the signs of four plus seven, and April really slowed, because again one of your peers who didn’t have April in their quarter had some real softness there, which obviously was in March. So maybe just talk us through month-by-month how things trended there? We really want to make sure it\\'s clear to the investment community what we saw during the quarter. So what I\\'d say is if we\\'ve been having this discussion at the end of February we\\'re feeling really good about the quarter. In fact, we got off to a very good start. And as we looked at our forecast for the remainder of the quarter, it looked pretty solid. But as we increasingly went through the month of March, we were expecting in the last seven to 10 days our normal push of orders to close this. And I\\'d say normal pushes across all the regions, because often we have lot of customers who have quarter end date. So typically, March is a pretty strong month for us. And when we closed the last week or so, the orders in March, it just wasn’t there. We just didn’t get normal month end surge. And then perhaps maybe some order didn’t get booked at the end of March, we didn’t see anything unusual in the beginning of the April. So I think it was that timeframe that we knew we\\'re in the midst of something that we hadn\\'t expected. I would say, again, I think it caught our teams by surprise. I had been in China at the latter part of March, and we just reviewed the forecast. And then we could see that they were caught unexpectedly by customer delays in China. We also saw the same thing in Europe and in the U.S. as well. Patrick, if I could just add one more thing. What I would tell you is and just to reinforce the confidence we have in regards to the second half outlook. April did come in relative to our expectations on orders, our recast orders on the LSAG front, obviously, too late for revenue. But that gives us confidence that we have a handle on where the market is right now. We came in relative to our forecast, yes. But again, we\\'re still saying that it\\'s going to be subdued the second half. I really wanted to -- it\\'s not a situation where we see a continuing worsening of the end market environment, but we\\'re also not seeing a dramatic improvement either. But we do believe we\\'ve gotten a level of predictability back in the business based on what we saw in April. And then maybe just one housekeeping item. Could you just help us frame how much of your business is small molecule? I know 30% is under that biopharma umbrella. But maybe just help us think about how much is specific to the… In fact, Bob and I were just talking about this right before the start of this call. And I think right now we characterize it as 80-20, which is about 80% is small molecule -- was about was about 85% two or three years ago. We think there will be a shift to more biopharma naturally in 2020, given just the continued strong growth we\\'re having with today\\'s portfolio. But back to my comments on NASD, once that additional revenue flows, you will see the benefits of our broader biopharma play that Agilent has. But right now, I\\'d characterize it at about 20% of our -- 20% or 30% is in biopharma. I guess just going back to China. I mean how much did you debate what to do with the assumption there, even though April came in seems like, or at least overall for the book in line. Obviously, the last couple days have been quite a lot just in terms of some of the trade tensions and the uncertainty. It\\'s possible some of the four plus seven pieces get worse just in terms of China\\'s restrictions. I guess, how confident are you that you titrated this correctly, not just for what you saw in April but the current macro relative to the last week or so where obviously we had a pretty disappointing outcome on trade? Ross, great question, I almost feel like you may have been inside the hall here at the Agilent offices. So this was a big point of discussion with the team. And where we landed was our team had brought down their forecast in China relative to where we were before. And what we said is we\\'re going to take a very conservative view. We\\'re going to assume that the strain on the overall pharma market continues in China, as well as food there is no recovery. So basically, we\\'re assuming that the softness that we had experienced already through much of to the back half of the quarter will continue in the second half. So I think we\\'ve tried to be prudent relative to taking a very conservative and bringing our forecast down. And as you know, we had a high single digit forecast for the full year for China, but I think we\\'re probably at about 3% for the whole year. Again, I would remind the group too that lot of the call is focused on LSAG, which has really been the center of our weakness for the quarter on the top line. But one of the reasons why we have confidence in the overall growth forecast for China is that we have very predictable results coming through on the ACG side, which is mid-teens growth. And I think it\\'s been fairly well-publicized that we\\'re underpenetrated on DDG So we have expectations of good solid growth in both of those businesses. So it feels like tail of two cities, we expected the continued strength on the ACG and DDG side in China, while bringing down our expectations on the LSAG side. And Bob, I know we have lot of debate on this one. So maybe you have something else you\\'d like to add there.  Ross, maybe to put some dimensions to that when we think about how we\\'ve taken our guidance down for the second half of the year, really about two thirds to 70% of that reduction is really reflective of China and the other third $10 million to $15 million is probably the broader pharma. So the majority of it is the lower expectation or tempered expectations in the China market. And maybe ACG margins were pretty impressive. The pull-through there continues to be north of 50%. I guess what\\'s driving the massive step up in that business this year? Because the expansion even relative to what you saw in the first quarter accelerated, and so trying to get a feel for the underlying. So Ross, I\\'m glad you noticed that, because we really were quite pleased with the overall margin performance in ACG. And I think I made the comment inside the company and said, listen we\\'ve proven that we can scale our service business and make good margins. What I would like to do is maybe turn the call over to Mark Doak to let him take a little bit of a bow here with the audience and maybe share, Mark, what specifically has been going on within your team? Thanks Mike. And on the margins front, obviously, we have seen a nice expansion through the first half along that. I\\'d just add to a couple of things I think Mike and Bob has alluded to. First of all, on the agile Agilent programs, many of these are shared services across the company, which certainly help the broader gross margins for the business. But inside of the business, particularly services, there has been two major themes. One is we\\'ve used advanced analytics to really look at how we can improve various aspects of our operations and using the analytics pretty widely over the course of the last year to help drive that. And now the second component of that, I have talked many times about our drive to put our business online and use things like mobile apps that fundamentally facilitate faster and more complete work flows for team on the ground. So you can put all those pieces together, it\\'s turned up to be actually a quite positive development but this is after a lot of years of investment to really build a platform across our services business that’s scalable. I’m going to have a couple more questions on pharma in a second, but I actually want to start on DDG. If pathology grew high single digits and NASD grew mid-teens, it would seem hard for DDG to only grow 5.3% core given those businesses account for about 60% of DGG sales, unless you have some weakness in genomics. How did genomics go in the quarter in the quarter? And how are competitive dynamics evolving in target enrichment? Or maybe I\\'m just stop off course here and if so maybe, you can point me in the right direction? I don\\'t know the exact math at about 6% overall for the DGG. But I think the answer would be genomics business came in exactly as we had forecasted overall. Clearly, there\\'s some competitive wins out there on the target enrichment side. But the main challenge that we\\'ve seen have been more on our legacy genomics. And Sam, anything you might want to comment on there? Mike, you said it right. There are puts and takes in any business. I mean, overall we performed as we expected. We had some -- we\\'re continuing to see some really good strength related to our QC part of the portfolio. And so really nothing more to add it\\'s… And the reason why I mentioned, recall our non-NGS part of genomics -- on NGS side, which is inclusive of target enrichment, which was close to double digits. So it\\'s been more of some of the older products… So on LSAG, it looks to us like LSAG would have to decline to get to the midpoint of fiscal Q3 guidance. We get to the high end with it actually flat year-over-year. And that\\'s not changing our DGG or ACG assumptions, which we don\\'t think we\\'re being too aggressive there and basically being consistent with what you guys have been talking about all year. So are you assuming LASG core growth declines in the third quarter? And if so, how do we reconcile that with your comment on instrument orders improving in April? Does that tell us something about May order trends, or is this just conservatism coming off of a weaker than expected quarter? As we think about the various pieces, obviously, there\\'s some variation there. But we\\'re assuming roughly flat for LSAG in Q3. Hopefully, that proves to be conservative. But given that we saw this late in the quarter, I think we\\'re taking a prudent approach for Q3. As Mike said, our April orders hit our revised forecast but that\\'s also one month. So, hopefully, it proves to be conservative but I think it\\'s the appropriate level of forecast right now. And I think, Bob, the way that Doug\\'s thinking about the modeling of ACG and DGG, that\\'s just how we\\'ve been thinking about as well. That’s right. We expect them -- they continue to perform as expected, and we would have continue to see the growth rates that they\\'ve experienced in the first half be similar in second half of the year. And last one, the slowdown in small molecule demand is something you\\'ve been talking about for a while. And clearly things were and are worse than you expected. So I think all of that\\'s clear. But I want to make sure on the large molecule side that growth met your expectations? So that\\'s, like I said earlier, it\\'s a tail of two cities. The biopharma continues to do quite well, both in the instrumentation side but also we\\'ve been investing very heavily on the chemistry side, inclusive of one of our recent acquisitions. ProZyme was really targeted in the in the biopharma side. And then also we have the NASD story as well. So the biopharma is right where we thought it would be. Doug, I would say the other thing is and that we\\'re talking a lot about pharma and certainly it didn\\'t meet our expectations. I would say the biggest variable in the quarter though was because we were expecting the anniversary of the reorganization and to have a much better performance and it was still down. So following up on the two question, just looking and this is -- obviously, your waters has issue as well. I mean, is it some business just go to Shimadzu, or some business go to Dionex or some of the other companies that are out there. I mean can you just talk about that’s it\\'s not just business shifting around rather than things not coming back? In fact, I think it was almost a year ago in my Q2 \\'18 call that we first started talking about the organization of the whole foods, safety and structure in China. And we\\'re really confident the business isn’t going anywhere else, it\\'s just not there. And when I talk about the business, think about it along two dynamics; one, which is the business that’s been shifted to contract testing labs, which we\\'re well positioned. What we\\'re focusing on the central agencies where Agilent has historically had a strong position. They were just not investing right now beyond supporting their ongoing operations with the chemistries and services. So we\\'re confident that the business isn’t going anywhere else, it\\'s just not there. And did you -- I mean, I think we\\'re all surprised by the strength in the first fiscal quarter. I men, did you -- is some of the weakness just potentially as you saw the recent stockpiling you didn\\'t see happening in Q1 that… No, in fact I think as I said earlier, we were sitting here at the end of February thinking that this quarter wasn’t developed just as it was. And what we didn’t anticipate was just how quickly the pharma business slowed down in China and then as well as the lack of recovery on the food side. And then there seem to be this whole small molecule side in U.S. and Europe. So really, it was a tail of the latter part of the quarter. We saw nothing unusual about our -- we can\\'t point anything usual relative to our Q1 results. And the U.S. and European pharma slowdown. Was this just capital not being -- I mean, I know there is always a little bit of slowness when we release the capital fund at the beginning of the year. Is it that? Or just people -- I mean, you mentioned some order delays. And I guess is because that the company is just nervous on their small molecule businesses? I mean, are they -- once again you\\'ve certainly been asked the question that they\\'ve asked to extending the life on their current instruments, or going along those lines just trying to figure out what\\'s driving that? I think it\\'s a little of both, Derek. I do think that there -- we haven\\'t seen -- we obviously have a backlog, but we haven\\'t seen orders being canceled, or people saying they are not purchasing. It\\'s actually being delayed. And so the question for us was, is it transitory and we\\'ll catch up, we are taking the approach that is probably not going to catch up and it\\'s just going to continue to push. But I also do think that there is probably some element of trying to get more mileage, so to speak, out of your existing instrumentation, particularly as they are looking at capacity. Bob, I think it\\'s very clear out there that we see that there\\'s certainly a conservative procurement tactics happening right now, and people are stalling a little bit. But at the same time, we have to see that our fund is quite rich. So we still see a lot of business, but it goes much slower these days. So we actually do believe that it\\'s a great opportunity out there, but we can\\'t call it right now. Mike, I\\'d like to step back a little bit, I\\'ve realized it\\'s early. But could you speak to -- as we look at fiscal \\'20? Could you speak to the relevancy of the 4.5% to 6% mid-term range that you talked about at the June Analyst Day last year relative to the 4% to 4.5% you\\'re going to put up this year? And what specifically needs to get better to achieve that? I think it\\'s probably a little early to talk about 2020. But there\\'s really isn’t anything developing that we can see that takes away from our long term view of still to grow this company. And we\\'ve got -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, we have two or three businesses, are performing very well. And we have some incremental stuff that’s going to be coming in those businesses in 2020. And then I think what we need to see is really focused on the soft points that we saw in the LSAG business, which is a return to positive growth, a higher level of growth in China, which I called out of my remarks and listen, the quarter obviously not developed as we had forecasted. But we believe that as things -- eventually things will get settled down, issues will get resolved and we\\'ll get clarity on even in generics, which are currently under lot of pressure. When that industry gets through that knot and the survivors are going to be in a reinvestment mode and who need to drive productivity, we think there\\'s going to be business there. So I think that part of the story for 2020 is it would turn to an improved China market environment takeover. Jacob, I think you\\'d like to jump in on this as well?  Yes, I think overall we over the past few quarters, we have also delivered some very nice NPIs new products introduction here in the market, and we still have a very strong funnel. So as Mike is saying, when the market is coming back, we are absolutely in very strong position to take our share of the market. In addition too, as Bob noted in his call, the chemical energy business, which I had positioned earlier on is the wild card for Agilent. On the upside, we actually had really, really solid growth in Q2. And we\\'re pretty optimistic about that for the rest of the year. And then secondly would love to get an update on how some of the more recent acquired assets are performing relative to your deal models, like a CN and AATI. Looks like the M&A contribution expected for the year came down a bit. So would love to get an update on how some of those assets are performing? Thanks. Overall, I think that they continue to do -- is early but in fact we just had to review on this yesterday afternoon, I mean it delivered strong double digit growth ahead of expectations. So while that is not yet in revenue so it\\'s tracking very nicely. AATI was still very pleased with the performance to-date. The growth rates are probably a little bit slower, tied to if you look at the number of new instrument placements that Alumina had in the first quarter. So to some extent that business growth rate is tied to the growth rate of the NovoCyte and some other parts of the portfolio in Alumina. We\\'re expecting I think, Sam, in the back half is probably looking a little bit better for that as Alumina gets one of those instruments placed. And I think we also got a fair number tied to PacBio, so that gets resolved. But you\\'re close to the numbers but overall, there\\'s still double digit growth out of the companies we acquired. And I\\'ve pointed to the cell analysis business overall has been a double digit grower for us in the quarter. I wanted to follow up and was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit more, contrasting some of the weakness on the capital side versus the strength you\\'re seeing in ACG. I guess, just what’s embedded in the outlook for CrossLab through the end of the year? And just the level of comfort that some of the slower replacement cycle in the instrument side that the recurring piece can hold up as you look out over the next year? Yes, we\\'re really confident about the outlook on the ECG business. And often we find that if you have a slowing capital replacement that actually is an upside to the services, in particular where they\\'ll often be extending the life of equipment. So, Bob, I think we\\'re pretty -- this is an area of high confidence for us. And Jack, we\\'re expecting the continued performance into the second half of the year like we have in the first half. And quite honestly, the way we had in \\'18 as well, which is high single digit growth there, really behind both services as well as the consumables. We aren’t seeing testing volumes decline, whether that\\'d be in pharma or any of the other end markets that are actually quite strong. And so we feel pretty good about that. Our forecast remains unchanged there. And then just wanted to follow up on some of the comments related to the NASD business, obviously growth came in a little better again in the quarter than we\\'re expecting. But just the pacing of when the new line is going to open up and just that fourth quarter step up you\\'re expecting, just to confirm that. In fact, we decide a review very timely call. So, we’re expecting most likely the fourth quarter is where we start to see some initial revenue coming out of the new site. We\\'re still in the final phases of validation. So we don’t want to say we\\'re done yet, but we\\'re getting close. And we have our first customer lined up to for those initial batches out of our Frederick site. And we\\'re planning and opening in mid June, but that’s just a ceremonial opening. We won\\'t be yet producing a product that we\\'re forecasting inside the company in the fourth quarter of this year. And so that’s some initial revenue then with the largest step up coming in 2020. I\\'d also just complement Sam and his team, because we continue to find ways to get more revenue out of our existing voter site. So I would also tell you that our full year revenue projections on NASD are well intact. And Jack, just to maybe build-on that. I wouldn’t build any incremental revenue in Q4 for your model, because as we ramp up the facility, it\\'s really going to be a material contribution in 2020. So maybe my first question is just wanted to clarify on USP regulation. I know USP has been helping you in the past in terms of ICP-MS. Was there a step down in that application as well across the pharma channel worldwide or was it just weak in China? And what\\'s your outlook in that business aligned with ICP-MS? I mean, I’m asking this because it\\'s levered to small molecules and your customers are using it for analyzing the small molecule coatings. I\\'ll make a few summary comments, and then I\\'ll have Jacob jump in on this. But I believe we think that was actually been declining in the pharma space. But overall, we expect really good growth in our spectroscopy business as we look out with some of the other applications given the stronger PMIs in U.S. and demand for product and other end markets outside of the USP. But, Jacob, why don\\'t -- you\\'re closer to than I am? Yes, you\\'re absolutely right that we still have very nice opportunity last year in USP, but now it\\'s moved on both to water analysis but also the STM business. And generally speaking, we see that the ICP-MS growth, particularly in U.S. is very strong this year. So we actually see that data, plenty of opportunity with ICP-MS. Obviously, when new regulations come in place, then there is a certain opportunity but it looks like we jumped in for opportunity in that space. And I think it will continue to grow. And my second question is around -- I appreciate that you\\'re getting challenging quarter in LSAG here. But just help us understand the -- I mean, you talked about the magnitude of benefit that you received in 8890 and 8860. I don\\'t know if you quantified that in the quarter. And I\\'m asking that because in last call you’ve mentioned you started shipping that instrument, I think, in the second week of February. And just wanted to get a sense of how that instrument is contributing and what\\'s your expectation for the rest of the year? Puneet, thanks so much for asking about this, because this is a real bright spot in the overall LSAG performance in Q2, and it speaks to our view of the future. We didn\\'t quantified and probably won\\'t quantify the exact contribution but we did start shipping. But I\\'d say right now we have more orders in backlog than we shipped. And I think we\\'re 150%, 200% of our forecast. I mean it\\'s pretty significant. It has been very significant. Obviously, it is also some customers decided to move from the 78 into the 88 faster than we anticipated. But at the same time, we\\'re also seeing that that with the 8860 going for the mid range that that combination with the mass spec has actually been quite successful also. So overall, we see good momentum but we haven\\'t quantified the incremental. And just last one if I could squeeze in around food again, just wanted to understand. Again, is that business largely all LC there, or how much is the comp -- I mean, how do you look at that business in terms of the types of customers that are actually there, and how do you expect this improvement? Thank you. So when we think about the food safety marketplace, in particular, which is where we\\'ve been focusing on comments relatively China. It really is primarily a mass spec place. You\\'re talking about GC/MS, LC/MS, ICP-MS and some standalone LCs. And I think this is one of the reasons why we\\'ve done so well in this place historically is just the breadth of the portfolio we have across all those technology platforms. So it is broader than -- for Agilent, it\\'s broader than LC. Just going to your guidance commentary, two thirds of the reductions from China. How much of that is four plus seven versus food? I would say of that, roughly two thirds of it is food and about a third of it is four plus seven. Overall, when we think about China, the small molecule business in China is roughly 2% to 3% of the overall Agilent revenue just to frame in the size. And then on the four plus seven program, what\\'s the incremental risk if that moves beyond the initial 11 pilot cities? And how long do you think it takes the market to work through these changes? I actually think the way we\\'re thinking about that, Catherine, is actually because while it\\'s only in 11 cities, I think it\\'s created a pause throughout the provinces to understand what the impact is. So it\\'s actually got greater. We think we\\'re seeing that impact now as opposed to further impact down the road. I think actually what you\\'ll see it\\'s once this determined, it will actually create clarity about what\\'s going to happen throughout the course. And we think we\\'ve seen the impact broader than just those 11 cities. And then just last one, we saw your SPMI drop below 53 in April, and your spends below 50 for a couple of months now. It sounds like you\\'re pretty optimistic on chemical energy outlook. So maybe talk about what you\\'re expecting in the back half for chemical energy and the puts and takes there? Our chemical and energy business in the back half is, we\\'ve talked about when we gave initial guidance at the beginning of the year low single-digit, and that’s what we\\'re thinking about. We\\'re positively surprised in Q2. For reference, Q1 was roughly 2% grew to 6% in Q2. We\\'re assuming low single digits in the back half of the year consistent with our early guide. And for Europe as well across the businesses we\\'re thinking low single digits, again consistent with our estimates at the beginning of the year. We\\'re positively surprised in Q2 but we\\'re expecting it to be consistent with what our initial expectations were. Two things for you, Mike. I guess, first, as it relates to the China food business. Have you thought it all -- is it possible that the softness continues for quite a while here even though we\\'ve started anniversary it as that volume moved to these more efficient commercial labs versus the previous government run lab? And then I just have one quick follow up. What\\'s happened also the charter of what these organizations do has changed. So a lot of the volume activities has been to the contract special labs and these guys are all now developing methods and the new reg. So we think they are going to require ultimately the next generation technologies equivalent to stay on leading the edge of research and development of new applications. If that being said, we\\'re not assuming any recovery in the second half of this year. So we\\'ve become much more cautious about the outlook for food in the second half. I think that’s fair… Yes, I mean, to be honest, we\\'ve assumed recovery and it\\'s taken a little longer than we expected. So we\\'re going to temper our growth until we\\'re wrong to the upside. And then, Bob just one quick follow up for you. And I know you\\'re not going to provide any 2020 guidance. But just give us some perspective on the new Frederick NASD site. It sounds like minimal revenue here in fiscal \\'19. Where do we get in fiscal \\'20 as it relates to the $100 million revenue potential capacity? Steve, you\\'re correct. We\\'re not going to give a forward looking. What I would say though is we\\'re generally on track with what we said back in June of last year in terms of the ramp up and so forth. So how that ramps across the quarters and across the year is still -- we haven\\'t gone through our planning cycle. But what I will tell you is that we feel very good, we have a very robust funnel for products that are going into that site. We\\'ve already had some customers toward the site. Obviously, it\\'s not operational yet, because we\\'re still doing the validation, as Mike talked about. But it\\'s moving along as we expected. I wanted to ask a question maybe back to, Jacob. I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color about what you\\'re hearing from customers on the pharma side in U.S. and Europe to account for the more restrictive budgets and if it\\'s related to anything with global macro, maybe for Mike. Have you seen any such impact to other businesses as well? Actually, what don’t I start off, Dan. And thanks for the question. And then I\\'ll pass it down to -- over to Jacob for specifics on pharma. We haven\\'t seen that in the other segments of the marketplace. And there\\'s a lot of noise out there, so uncertainty is never good. But we really can\\'t point to anything specific. And I think if you look at our results, I mean, you saw two, three businesses continue to perform as expected and do quite well. And then we had some isolated but obviously impactful slowdowns in aspects of the LSAG business, albeit the chemical energy, academic government, environmental forensics, and biopharma, were continued sources of strength. So I think it\\'s really been isolated to the factors you mentioned. And I know, Jacob, you\\'ve been trying to do a little bit more diligence around this. And we have some theories but I\\'m not sure we have 100% specific answer of what\\'s driving the customers and delay the purchases on the small molecule side. No, clearly, we are seeing that conservative procurement tactics that they are they using. And obviously, we\\'ve been out doing our own digging to understand what is really going on there. And first of all, we don\\'t see any change in competitive dynamics. This is not -- this is truly a market situation we\\'re in right now. So this is where it\\'s -- people are the procurement organizations and customers and they only are just more cautious in their decision on capital equipment expenditure right now. So I think just more speculation on our part, but we -- some of the things where, hey, there\\'s still some question about where prices are in land in certain parts of the world in terms of unused prices, some questions about growth. And then again, as we mentioned earlier in the call, prioritization that when push comes to shove, privatization of biopharma over small molecule. Again, we just think it\\'s a push out delay business has not been canceled. And then the related to a question, I know that was asked earlier, just want your clarification. So I think you gave us what pharma has baked in for Q3. Can you just let us know what assume pharma and food for Q3 and Q4 and just remind us, how big is your China food business? So on the on the guidance -- Dan, this is Bob. We\\'re assuming, as I mentioned before, for pharma mid single digit growth for the full year, and that\\'s consistent with where we are for Q3 as well on a global basis. So better than the 2% that we had in Q2. In food, we’re expecting for Q3 probably a slight decline as well. As I mentioned, hopefully that proves to be conservative but we\\'re assuming that overall for the full-year, food will be flat to slightly down. And I think historically, Bob, it\\'s run about 15% to 18% of our China business has been in food. Obviously, with the decline is probably close to that 15% number. And then if I can ask one more since that seems to be the trend here, just on the cap deployment, obviously, more towards the buyback in Q3. But how are you thinking about M&A? Obviously, you have a lot of balance sheet optionality. Just wondering what the pipeline looks at and how we think about over the next say six to 12 months? Thanks. In fact, the pipeline looks very robust. And as I signaled I believe in the last call, we\\'re very active right now and don’t have anything announce, but we want to deploy the capital. We want to leverage the strength on the balance sheet. Bob is very explicit to how we\\'re going to use one aspect of that relative to the buy back side, but we have plenty of firepower to execute on targets. And as you can see based on my earlier comments and some of the numbers we’re putting up with the companies we have acquired, we\\'re increasingly confident in our ability to deliver on SOVs, if you will, for our shareholders when we deploy that capital. And that concludes today\\'s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dhingra for closing remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies third quarter earnings conference call. . And now I\\'d like to introduce you to the host for today\\'s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s third quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent\\'s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob\\'s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of Agilent\\'s CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today\\'s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of July 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations. The Agilent team delivered total revenues of $1.27 billion, up 6% on a core basis. Our EPS of $0.76 is up 13%. Both our top line revenue and EPS are above the high end of our guidance range. This marks our 18th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. In July, we also announced the pending acquisition of BioTek, which would be our largest acquisition since the 2015 launch of the new Agilent. We continue to invest for growth even amid market uncertainty. At the same time, our Agile Agilent business system continues to drive operational improvements. Our excellent overall company growth is being driven by two factors. First, strength in the global pharma market in both small molecule and biopharma. Secondly, geographic strength in the U.S. across most end market segments. China growth was generally in line with expectations. Business unit performance is led by double-digit growth in our Agilent CrossLab and Diagnostic and Genomics Group. Let\\'s take a closer look at the performance of all 3 of our business groups. I will start with ACG, our Agilent CrossLab Group. The ACG business continues its trajectory of consistently strong results with 11% core growth. This growth was broad based across all market segments and regions. Our service business grew at a double-digit rate as we continue to see higher demand for our expanding portfolio, both from current and new customers. We see a continued secular trend of customers seeking to drive increased productivity and to outsource non-core services in the lab. Our services offering puts us in a leadership position to benefit from that trend. Our consumables business also grew double-digit. We continue to introduce highly differentiated consumables and address important customer challenges and a significantly improved user experience, especially in high-growth markets like biopharma. I\\'m very pleased with the continuing positive impact on total company results from the Agilent\\'s CrossLab strategy. Our consistent results speak to the strong execution from the Agilent team and the value we bring to our customers. We\\'re meeting the ever-increasing demand from our customers, and we see the attach rates to our installed base of instruments consistently improving. Now turning to DGG, our Diagnostics and Genomics Group business. DGG\\'s growth momentum continues with strong 13% core growth. The growth is broad based across pathology, genomics, and our NASD businesses. Let me share a few additional comments on our NASD business. NASD turned in a very strong third quarter as we continued to see increasing demand from our customers\\' clinical trials. As a reminder, in June, we opened our second production facility located in Frederick, Colorado. We remain on track to start commercial shipments this quarter. We also announced that we purchased our previously leased site in Boulder, Colorado. These 2 facilities enable Agilent to meet the growing demand for development of RNA-based therapeutics and continue to be a partner of choice to both pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  Now moving on to our LSAG, our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group business. LSAG\\'s revenue is flat year-over-year on a core basis and in line with our expectations. Strength in the pharma, environmental, and forensics markets was offset by chemical energy declining against a very tough 12% compare and expected weakness in the China food market. As you know, in Q2, we discussed 3 areas that impacted LSAG\\'s growth rates. Let me give you an update.  First, starting with the 4+7 initiative in China. We saw a sequential improvement in demand from generics manufacturers. This is driven by business coming from the winners of the first 4+7 pilot, resulting in growth in our instruments business. We have deep relationships and history with these customers. While the program is expected to expand over the rest of the calendar year, we see incremental regulatory clarity ultimately drive increased production volumes in a favorable long-term investment environment. Second, the China food market conditions remain the same as last quarter and in line with our expectations, with revenues flat to Q2. The business from government-owned labs remains muted, while commercial testing labs activity is increasing. We are expecting similar overall market conditions this coming quarter as well.  Finally, the global small molecule pharma business outside of China saw improvement in demand relative to Q2. We saw budgets free up and LC replacements taking place in some of our large accounts as well as the addition of new customers. While macroeconomic and political conditions are creating market uncertainty for capital investments, I am quite confident in our ability to take market share in whatever market environment we encounter. We have an industry-leading portfolio and are not sitting still. We continue to invest in new offerings and markets. One of these new market investments is the pending acquisition of BioTek. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire BioTek, a global leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of innovative cell analysis instrumentation. I\\'m very excited by the significant step forward in strengthening our leadership position in the fast-growing cell analysis space. Our strategic focuses there began with the purchase of Seahorse Bioscience in 2015 and was followed by the acquisitions of Luxcel Biosciences and ACEA Biosciences in 2018. By combining BioTek\\'s offering with Agilent, we will create a business with revenues greater than $250 million per year, up from zero four years ago, this business is growing double digits today. Looking ahead, we will now be able to deliver a breadth of differentiated workflows, enabling customers to obtain deeper, more reliable insights across a variety of cell analysis applications. This is yet another example of how we\\'re investing in new, high-growth markets where we can leverage core Agilent capabilities in our One Agilent culture. The culture and portfolio fit with BioTek are extremely well aligned. We share the same core values and have very similar cultures with a genuine focus on our customers and teams. I look forward to welcoming the BioTek team into the Agilent family. We expect the acquisition to close later this fiscal quarter. We also continue to bring new and innovative offerings to the market across all of our businesses. These new offerings are consistently drawing very strong interest from both new and existing customers. For example, earlier this year, we launched major updates to our gas chromatography, spectroscopy, and genomics portfolio.  In addition, in Q3, we had an excellent showing at the ASMS Conference highlighted by the launch of a new Agilent Infinity Lab LC/MSD iQ system. This new system incorporates designed-in smart features, software, and hardware, developed specifically for chemists and chromatographers. Our new LC/MSD iQ system is a single-quad mass spec, built on the revolutionary Ultivo LC Triple Quad core technology platform. We also launched a brand-new Agilent 6546 LC/Q-TOF system that provides analyst ability to simultaneously acquire high-resolute data across unprecedented dynamic range. In addition, during the quarter, we introduced a new Agilent 6495 C Triple Quad LC/MS system that provides industry-leading precision in complex major Cs. And finally, we introduced a new Agilent Bravo sample prep system for metabolic analysis of human plasma samples. This new offering further strengthens our leading position in metabolomics. We also brought to market the first outcome of our joint development work with a newly combined Agilent and ACEA teams. At the CYTO 2019 conference, we introduced the NovoCyte Advanteon flow cytometer. This new offering addresses today\\'s high end and increasingly sophisticated multi-color flow cytometry assays. It provides unsurpassed sensitivity, resolution, detection speed, and the flexibility of resin channel. In addition, the number of indications from our PD-L1 diagnostic assay continue to expand. In Q3, we received FDA approval for 2 new indications. Our PD-L1 diagnostic may now be used as an aid in identifying patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA in a total of 6 cancer types. While making all these investments and launching new products, we continued our trajectory of margin expansion by 90 basis points versus last year. Our Agile Agilent system of continuous process improvement and disciplined cost management keeps the team focused on finding and executing on new opportunities. A few closing comments on our Q3 results and company transformation that has been underway for several years. Looking ahead, we continue to see uncertainty in a challenging market environment in some end markets for capital instrument purchases. This quarter\\'s results again demonstrate Agilent\\'s ongoing transformation towards higher growth markets in an increasingly resilient business model with a higher mix of recurring revenue streams. Given our Q3 results and outlook, we\\'re raising our full year guidance for earnings as well as revenue growth at the midpoint of guidance, and Bob will describe this in more detail.  Before I turn it over to Bob, I\\'d like to leave you with a few -- a couple of thoughts here. At the close of our Q2 call, I commented that great companies do not just react to market conditions, they see market opportunity. At Agilent, we will continue to invest for growth and take market share in whatever market conditions we encounter. We\\'re continuing to drive productivity and we\\'re doubling down our efforts to be a more agile company. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to invest in the business and return capital to our shareholders. I\\'m quite confident that our company has never been stronger and that we\\'re well positioned to drive continued growth and earnings expansion in an increasingly uncertain global economy.  Thanks for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions. I\\'ll now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\\'ll provide some additional detail in revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and to discuss our capital deployment during the quarter. I\\'ll then finish up with our updated guidance for Q4 and full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike said, our third quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across a number of fronts. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, with core revenue growth of 6.2%. Reported growth was 5.8%, with currency negatively impacting revenue by 1.9 points and acquisitions adding 1.5 points to growth.  In terms of end markets, pharma, diagnostics and clinical, and environmental and forensics, led the way for us in the third quarter. Pharma, our largest market, grew 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments, services and consumables as well as NASD, our biopharma business continues to grow at double-digit rates, and we saw good growth in the small molecule business as well, both in instruments and recurring revenues.  Our Environmental and forensics business grew 15% on a core basis in the third quarter, albeit on an easier compare. As with the second quarter, our forensic strength is tied to demand for expanded lab capabilities. This is a result of the ongoing global opioid crisis, which is driving increased sample testing and broader screening requirements. Our environmental business grew high single digits. Again, driven by the ongoing expansion of testing in China. Diagnostics and clinical, core revenue grew 7% during the quarter, driven by strength of our pathology and genomics businesses. Chemical and energy revenue grew 1% against a very tough compare of 12% growth from Q3 of last year. Results were driven by continued strength in services and consumables.  Academia and government declined 5%, largely due to order timing and rounding out the discussion of end markets, food revenue declined 3%, driven by China coming in as we expected, and as Mike discussed.  On a geographic basis, we again saw growth in all regions, led by the U.S., growing at double-digit rates, with strength across all 3 businesses. China grew 1%, generally in line with our expectations, primarily due to the weakness in food. If you exclude food, growth in China was 6%; Asia, outside of China, also grew at a double-digit rate, driven by growth in Japan and South Korea. Europe grew 3%, in line with our expectations as the market environment remains subdued. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, essentially flat year-over-year, with tariffs impacting gross margin adversely by 30 basis points. We\\'ve been able to mitigate the impact to tariffs through discipline and cost management, and the ongoing focus on efficiency. Our operating margin was 22.8%, up 90 basis points as revenue growth outpaced growth in operating expenses. Year-to-date, our margins continue to expand as our teams have executed strong expense discipline.  And as a result, non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.76, $0.03 higher than the top end of our guidance and representing 13% growth. In addition to our operating performance, we were very active in deploying capital during the quarter. In Q3, we returned $600 million to shareholders. We bought back shares worth $549 million, totaling 8 million shares, and paid $51 million in dividends. As Mike mentioned, we also signed a definitive agreement to acquire BioTek Instruments and expect the deal to close by the end of our current fiscal fourth quarter.  So year-to-date, including BioTek, we\\'ve committed to deploying over $2.2 billion in capital this year. Of that, $1.4 billion was spent in growth acquisitions with ACEA and BioTek, expanding our cell analysis franchise. We have also returned over $800 million through dividends and share buybacks. Our balance sheet today remains healthy and we continue to look for opportunities to add growth assets to our portfolio.  Now turning to the cash flow. We generated $242 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter in an effectively cash neutral position. Now let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the year -- fiscal year. As Mike mentioned, with the strong results in Q3 and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Please note that our guidance does not include any impact from the expected BioTek acquisition. For the full year revenue guidance, we\\'re increasing the lower end of our range. Thereby, increasing the midpoint, resulting in a new range of $5.105 billion to $5.125 billion, representing 3.9% to 4.3% reported growth. Currency is expected to be a headwind of roughly 200 basis points, partially offset by M&A contributing 150 basis points. As a result, we\\'re now expecting core revenue growth in the range of 4.4% to 4.8% for the full year. With the strong execution we\\'ve seen in terms of our business strategies, we\\'re raising our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.07 to $3.09. This represents growth of 10% to 10.8% for the year. And now turning to the fourth quarter. We\\'re expecting revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion, representing reported growth of 1.2% to 2.8% and core growth of 1.5% to 3%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of roughly 100 basis points partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 70 to 80 basis points of growth. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86 per share, which is 3.7% to 6.2% reported growth versus a year ago. Also of note, the newly announced tariffs on the additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China is not expected to be material for us. And the share count for Q4 is expected to be 313 million shares. Now before opening up the call for questions, I\\'d like to conclude by saying that Agilent\\'s resilient business model is built for the long term. We believe we are focused on the right strategies that will continue to serve us well and ensure solid shareholder value long into the future. Mike and team, can you talk a little bit more, obviously, the China number, the 4+7 tailwind -- hit, seemed to be a little less in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more? You mentioned spending. And I guess, it\\'s like how are you sort of thinking about spending patterns now that the second wave kicks in. Just a little bit more color in what you\\'re seeing there. And then, as a correlated question, there\\'s obviously a lot of changes going on in the drug manufacturing space right now with some consolidation going on. Obviously, some M&A into the ones that\\'s like -- how are you sort of thinking about some of the changes going on in terms of the bigger generic players, some of the consolidation in the space? And I guess, how are you positioned in those markets? Yes. Sure. Let me -- I\\'ll take the first one, and Jacob, he can pass the second one to you. So, first of all, as we talked in the last call, we had seen a pause in our second quarter as it related to the rollout of the 4+7 initiative. But at the time, we said, listen, we\\'ve actually did a good thing, a long term and eventually will lead to increased divestments once we start to sort out who the winners are. So -- and that actually is how the quarter developed for us where we actually saw the winners starting to invest. And we think that level investment relative to Wave 1 will continue through our fiscal year.  As it relates to the core of your question, which is how about Round 2? Our view is that they\\'re going through a process of doing the bidding and sorting out the winners over the latter part of this year, and the impact on the business is more an FY \\'20 kind of impact in terms of what we\\'re going to see in China. But again, I\\'d just point to -- we think these are good long-term developments for our business here because of the strength of our relationships and their real emphasis on productivity and compliance. And Jacob, your thoughts around the -- questions about the industry consolidations and generics? Yes. I think that\\'s a really relevant question. And clearly, with some of the winners coming out now in China, I think we will see some consolidation. I think Agilent will be in a very good position in this space, both in China and in general as we have very strong relationship with many of the larger end winners in the generic space. So, when this happens, which is part of the normal pharma cycle, we are ready to support them and make them successful. And Derik, I just meant to put a period of this one, which is whether the generic consolidations are happening in China or in other parts of the world, we think overall, the productivity message and real value we can deliver to this segment of market really, really resonates with them. I guess maybe just digging in a bit on DGG, Rob. I think the performance there was kind of notably strong, and so you called out a couple things, including an NASD , which seems like it\\'s starting to ramp, but also a bit on opioids, and then on the sort of array side. But academic was weak. Just give us a little bit of a picture kind of the magnitude, maybe, of some of the outperformance in some of these pieces. And then, sort of how to think about that cadence maybe in the context of sort of the fourth quarter guide. Sure, Ross. I\\'ll make some initial comments here, then Sam, you can jump in and correct me if I\\'m off target here. But one of the messages that we were trying to convey in our earnings call, which is while the NASD growth was very strong in the quarter, that wasn\\'t the only bright spot in DGG. It really was across the board whether it be in our pathology business, and we think we\\'re putting up numbers that are growing faster than the market whether it be because of the increased acceptance for automation platform with the Omnis, the continued utilization and expansion of the PD-L1 assay on the genomics side. We saw good growth in our NGS related business, Sam. I think that was probably double-digit for us for the quarter... And then lead for the NASD strength, which we think is here to stay. Looking into the fourth quarter, we\\'re kind of thinking something like high-single digits, I think, for this business. And Sam, anything else you want to add there? Because the only message I want to get across was broad-based strength. Now I think, Mike, you really outlined where the business is. And pathology, it\\'s a business that\\'s built over time, right? It\\'s not just about a single quarter, but it is the combination of the assays that we have, the increasing number of indications, PD-L1 related that we announced 2 of them, approval from the FDA, but it\\'s also the ongoing growth in our installed base, be it of Omnis, be it of other platforms. And our Companion Diagnostic business, which a lot of it feeds into that, is also -- it\\'s performing in a really healthy way. The genomics business, also, as you said, it performed well, but that\\'s broad-based around the world. So, we\\'re pleased to see that both in terms of genomics-related instruments like the platforms that we have for TapeStation, Bioanalyzer, the AATI product category. So, we feel good about the performance in the coming quarter or two. And then, maybe, just on the C&E side, I mean, obviously, you called out a tough comp, but a lot of macro volatility in the last few weeks, a lot of things happening on the trade side. I guess, how are you trying to interpret sort of all the key leads in that subsegment as you\\'ve had some good underlying product cycle. But obviously, there\\'s some instability just broadly. And so, how do you feel like, aside from sort of competing well in whatever market there is about sort of what that actual end market environment is going to look like for the next quarter or 2? Yes. Great question, Ross. It\\'s something we\\'ve spent a lot of time here inside the company talking about. And kind of entering into this year, we had some concerns about the chemical energy market just in terms of -- there\\'s macro noise even coming into our physical year. So I think we got it, like kind of low singles coming into the year. But as you may recall, in our first guide, after we raised the guidance, hey, this could be a source of upside.  Well, clearly, that is not happening. So we\\'re still assuming kind of low single digits, but probably negative growth in instruments because even though the product cycles are really strong, I think we\\'re well positioned to win when money\\'s there. But we\\'re still going to assume for the -- at least the rest of this fiscal year that there will be growth in chemical energy. But overall, that will be driven by the strength of our ACG business, and we expect the demand to be pretty, pretty muted, if you will, in the C&E. And Bob, maybe you can take a quick look at this -- deep look at this, and maybe have some quick comments. Yes. I think that\\'s right, Mike. And Ross, thanks for the question. If you look at our Q4, I think we\\'re trying to be prudent in our forecast certainly with continued strength in our ACG and DGG businesses. But yes, LSAG or the capital business is continuing to have slow growth and capital in the C&E areas, one of those markets that we\\'re looking at. And certainly with PMIs, the way that they are and as you say, the uncertainty in the market certainly isn\\'t helping. And so we think we\\'ve tried to take that into account for our fourth quarter.  The new products that Mike mentioned didn\\'t have a material impact on the quarter. But the ones that we\\'ve launched, the gas chromatographs and so forth, continued to have very positive uptake. But it\\'s -- the market is slower, kind of as -- and it\\'s kind of playing out the way we expected at the very beginning of the year. I guess if there\\'s one silver lining in terms of -- which is the, again, back to this productivity message and the fact that we now have a fleet of really great new products and there\\'s a real productivity benefit to the customer, they\\'re in a stronger position to go to their management and get support for their investment because it does really help their P&L. Mike, can you talk a little bit about the global pharma picture? You said it delays last quarter. Now you\\'re saying kind of budget\\'s freed up. So how much of the 13% growth you saw was just kind of catch up from last quarter? And how you\\'re feeling about sustainability of that going forward? So I\\'ll let Bob do a little math on the catch-up. But let me make some macro comments while you\\'re doing your mental math. But as we pointed out in Q2, we said, hey, in Q2, biopharma really is quite strong. By the way, it was strong and even stronger this quarter. But we said, hey, we saw a pause in the small molecule side outside of China and we talked a lot already about the 4+7 but it really was kind of curious or something, what was going on with our large accounts in U.S. and Europe. And I think they were just being prudent in their budgeting process, and we saw a release of funds in the -- in our third quarter. And we\\'re expecting that to continue.  So we don\\'t see that as being a one-quarter phenomena, albeit that that\\'s why we try to use the words in some end markets we\\'re expecting some pretty challenging market conditions. So pharma, actually, we think is continuing to be a source of growth on the LSAG instrument side, while we expect some markets to actually be down year-over-year. And Bob, I don\\'t know how we can parse out the catch-up? Yes. I think, Tycho, the way I would talk about it is, as I mentioned, the pharma business grew 13% in the quarter. And if you look at small molecule, it was mid-single digits. So there was probably some catch-up, but I wouldn\\'t say it was material that, that mid single-digits is kind of where it has been historically over the last several quarters. So I think it -- what we have said and kind of the hypothesis has been that\\'s primarily a replacement cycle. They can hold off for a number of quarters but they can\\'t do that forever if they want to keep their manufacturing processes in place. And so we think we are in that. It wasn\\'t a snapback. So there wasn\\'t more in Q3 than what we saw. But I think it was now they\\'re getting further in the fiscal year and they\\'re actually spending that money. Yes. I think that\\'s correct. But we do see that the larger accounts are still very conservative in the procurement, while some smaller pharma actually is investing these days. So that\\'s where we actually see some of the growth coming from also. And we are taking good share there. Yes. Thanks for the build there because in my narrative, I talked about the business coming not only from existing customers, but new customers. And we\\'ve been very aggressive in that regards as well. Bob, I\\'m not sure we have much more insight. And that business tends to be lumpy for us, right? And... Yes. As you know, it\\'s a relatively -- it\\'s the smallest piece of our business and it goes up and down. And so we\\'re not going to call out any one particular order or orders across the business. But we feel good about our position there going forward. And we\\'re expecting that to return to growth in the fourth quarter. I will also say, back on the pharma business, when we look at our ability, I think one of the things that speaks well to our value proposition with our customers is when you look year-over-year, our pricing actually has held up pretty well. Our pricing is roughly -- it\\'s slightly above on the LSAG business. So I think that speaks to the value that we are able to bring from a productivity standpoint to customers. Hey, Bob, back on academia and government, maybe just to share a discussion we were having inside the company, which was we\\'re not a little bit concerned about this because we still see the funding environment. It\\'s actually being quite strong and stable. So it\\'s just a timing issue. So we don\\'t see anything happening materially different in the marketplace. Okay. If I could ask one last clarification before hopping off. On China, 4+7, do you expect the impact to be the same magnitude next year as it is this year, given that it\\'s different rules for Round 2? I wasn\\'t sure from your comments earlier if you... So Tycho, I\\'m going to resist the temptation to do an FY \\'20 guide. But I would say, directionally, it\\'s going to be an increase. Mike, just starting with the China food business. Can you just sort of give us an update on where you stand as far as building out some of your commercial teams to go after that private lab channel in China? Sort of your general visibility now today relative to maybe where you were three months ago. Yes. Happy to do so. So we\\'re fully built out. So we\\'ve been working this probably well over 1-year, 15 months. Because I think the first time I started talking about this was Q2 \\'18 call. So from a channel reach, channel perspective, we\\'re there both in terms of our direct reach, but also through some of our digital enablement of customers. So we feel really good about our channel reach and relationships with the commercial accounts. And we\\'re seeing it in the numbers. So we\\'re seeing really -- it\\'s really a tale of two cities. And Jacob, I\\'ll have you jumping on this one as well in a second, because I know you\\'ve been digging into this, but sort of tale of two cities. We\\'re getting good growth on the commercial. There\\'s just no real new investment happening on the government lab side of things. So... Yes. That\\'s true, Mike. And we do see double-digit growth on the contract labs these days, but coming from a smaller base. And while -- so we have our very large market share in the government account. So clearly, when the catch up is happening, I actually believe we will see a very strong growth in this business again. Yes. If there\\'s any silver lining, it would be as Q3 was as we expected. So we weren\\'t surprised by the number, albeit down. Yes. And as we\\'re thinking about Q4, we\\'re expecting Q4 to be -- kind of play out the way Q2 and Q3 did in terms of roughly flat at that $40-ish million revenue run rate. Right. Which, looking at our -- I think we clocked a 16% growth overall in China Q4 last year. So I would say up against a tough compare. And then, maybe one more for Mark Doak. The gross margins in the CrossLab business are pretty substantially year-over-year. I think the new high at 52%. Sort of speak to the drivers of that gross margin improvement and sort of what you see is the midterm runway, midterm opportunity for gross margins. Sure. I\\'ll be glad to. And if you pull us back, it\\'s several things contributing to it. Over time, mix has been a play in terms of our consumables business being from a margin perspective, north of the company average. But also, a lot of work we\\'re doing is relative to some of the Agile Agilent programs, but specifically looking at delivery efficiencies and our services team. We\\'ve been able to add a lot more revenue without a lot of proportional cost to that. And that comes to really what we\\'re seeing increasing as a big factor in our margin expansion is scale. And we\\'re in that position now where we can invest. Mike had talked about some of our digital capabilities, both in the channel, but also in the back office areas. And it starts to fuel these efficiencies. We can reinvest some of those profits to build even more strength in the area. So it\\'s really eating off itself as you will. And when you pull it all together, between portfolio mix, continued move towards scale, and driving efficiencies through these digital capabilities. So those probably the big drivers behind it. So first one on the cell analysis market. I mean with your recent acquisition of BioTek, and obviously, you\\'ve added Seahorse and ACEA before, do you think you have enough pieces here to sort of ultimately serve this growing and expected to be even further growing cell therapy developed in the market? And -- or do see more room for further capital deployment here? And I should say that this did increase your biologics exposure in some ways and it\\'s likely to increase that. So just wanted to get a sense of what you have currently, and should we expect more here? Yes. So let me start this off, and then, Jacob, feel free to chime in as well. So we think now at $250 million, we have a business with scale. And I think that\\'s really important to say. We think we really compete. And really, we are really bullish on this space. And I think our investments dreams started several years ago. So whilst we are still in the process of digesting what we\\'ve just recently acquired, and then we have to bring the Agilent -- into the Agilent family, the new BioTek team. So we think we have a lot of really good scale once we close with the BioTek acquisition. But that being said, I think we have further aspirations to continue to build-out in that space as well. Yes. And building on that, I think, first of all, we clearly have scale today. But what is very important here is that the strategy we started out some years ago, 4 years ago now, was not just to build scale in the cell analysis business, but build differentiated components that could build together into workflows that would really do differentiate -- really provide differentiating information for our customers. So not only have flow -- up against flow and some plate with  against paid, we will combine them together with a particularly important immuno-oncology space, and especially here in the CAR-T space. We\\'ve seen that already happening. So before actually the acquisition of BioTek, we used the Seahorse and the BioTek and collaborated between the two companies to provide a workflow that combine those two technologies together in the same software and the same micro type of plate, and we saw that, that actually grew the market opportunity significantly. So now combining the Seahorse, ACEA, the BioTek and Luxcel together, I think we have a really, really strong differentiated position, but it also allows us to add more workflows into that space going forward. But our main priority right now is to integrate and be successful with BioTek. And Puneet, I\\'d just say, that with revenue synergies often theoretical, when you do an acquisition, we\\'ve actually have real proof points already with customers and markets that we can do this, and there\\'s real value to customers. Okay. Great. And if I could touch on the NASD business. Just wanted to get a sense of if you could quantify how much was that and sort of in the quarter. And the current run rate that you have in sort of what -- what\\'s your expectation longer term here? Has that changed from the sort of the earlier expectation in the comments that you gave around customers demanding the RNAi product and the overall long-term view of the business? Yes. Much like avoiding the temptation of talking about FY \\'20 guide, I\\'ll also avoid the temptation to talk about specific details on a product line level. But what I can do is give you a directional number. So I think we\\'ve been talking about this business hitting probably $100 million or so this year. And then, as we look into FY \\'20, we\\'ve added at least that much in terms of capacity. So we hope to be up to a larger number in the -- by the end of next year at the sort of a run rate level, at a higher number. We\\'re not ready to kind of commit to what the number actually is, but it\\'s going to be a pretty -- a nice step up for us. And Bob, I know you\\'ve been doing some modeling in this area as well already. Yes. I think Puneet, I mean, nothing has changed. We had a very good quarter. We\\'re expecting another very good quarter next year -- or next quarter, excuse me, largely in the back of our existing capacity. And the team has just done a fantastic job. As Mike said, we\\'re on pace to delivering that $100 million consistent with what we said, really, since the beginning of the year. And we\\'re excited about the new facility coming online. And as Mike mentioned, it\\'s bringing on manufacturing capacity right now and look forward to \\'20 and beyond serving our customers And by the way, don\\'t interpret my comments as being any less bullish in this space. We just know that as we bring on the new facility, you have to time when you actually can start the batches up, but a lot of that is being driven by customers timing when they\\'re doing the clinical trials. So we\\'re much more specific when we do our FY \\'20 guide because we\\'ll have a much better handle on the timing when these new customers will be coming into our new facility. I can tell you we\\'ve sold a good percentage of that capacity already. One thing that we\\'ve already stated is the basis of this as the number of clinical trials and work being done here. We see the supplier opportunity for us going from $0.5 billion market to over $750 million over the next several years. So we\\'re going to grow with that. And it is a fact, too, that we are doubling our overall capacity for manufacturing. But I just want to reemphasize what both Mike and Bob said that there is a ramp up process over a number of years. So just because we\\'re doubling our capacity, doesn\\'t mean we\\'re going to be double our revenue there. Just to be explicit about that again. But we\\'ll be very... First, I was just wondering, can you go into a bit more detail on your strong results in environmental and forensics? I think this is the fourth quarter in a row of high single-digit or double-digit growth there. So I\\'d just be curious to hear more details on the drivers in that end market. Yes. And again, it speaks to the portfolio we build up here over the past years on really robust reliable instrumentation that allow us to really go into -- of course, opioid is a big crisis here in U.S. So we have actually quite a large growth in that area. We also seen soil and water. Here in U.S, which have actually driven a lot of business. And the same token, China has actually continued to have strong growth in both those areas, specifically the environmental, which is heavily regulated. So we are doing very well in regulated spaces, and this has driven also the momentum and forensic this quarter. I was just going to say, if I could add to that too, in concert with Jacob, we\\'ve been working a lot on the environmental side in terms of the end market workflows and complementary consumables and services to go along with it. So that\\'s clearly another driver of this end market for us. Okay. And then, we heard one of your peers talk about starting to see a bias against U.S. companies in some China tenders. Are you seeing signs of that dynamic as well? Catherine, thanks for asking that question. Not at all. So that\\'s always been the risk of the heightened tensions between U.S. and China as it relates to trade. We have not at all seen that in our business. I only have one question, but it has three or four parts. So I know -- I don\\'t want to disappoint. So I know you\\'re up against a tough comp in Q4, and I\\'m guessing there\\'s some desire to be a bit more conservative in the current environment. That said, given the strength of really, ACG and DGG in Q3 and really the past few quarters, we would have expected Q4 revenue growth guidance to be a bit higher. So one, were there any timing dynamics that benefited Q3 at the expense of Q4? Two, did you see any end market conditions weaken over the course of Q3? And if so, are you baking in an assumption into guidance that this continues in the fourth quarter? Three, are you assuming that LSAG growth is lower in Q4 versus the flat performance in Q3? Because it seems like you\\'d have to unless you\\'re expecting ACG and/or DGG to moderate. And four, kind of building up on the last one, I\\'m just wondering if NASD is not expected to be as strong in Q4 as Q3, maybe just because things have to pause a little bit as you bring new capacity on. Yes. So Doug, we\\'ve been waiting for these questions. So thanks for putting it out there. And I\\'ll start off, and then have Bob share some of our guide velocity. So I really want to be really clear on this. We saw nothing unusual relative to pulling in from the fourth quarter. So our book-to-bill is solid. And so there\\'s nothing unusual we have in terms of changing the seasonality business by pulling in from Q4 into Q3. When we look at our LSAG business, we actually expected a decline in Q4 off that tough compare. I think you\\'re off 9% last year. And now there\\'s two other parts. I only got two of the four parts. Yes. I wrote some of them down. So Doug, I\\'ll try to tag team with Mike. As Mike said, we didn\\'t see any pull forward or any dynamic that took orders out of Q4 into Q3. And as you said, our backlog actually did not deteriorate. But that being said, you\\'re seeing it. We saw it today, right, in the market. There\\'s a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The trade resolution is nowhere -- it\\'s no closer now than it was when we had our call back in Q2. And so we\\'re de-risking Q4 a little bit relative to where we were. It is a tough comp. And there is a little more uncertainty in the marketplace today than it was even 3 months ago, and we\\'re trying to be prudent there. That being said, we raised the full year on the top line and certainly on the bottom line, and feel good about that.  To your question about NASD, we are expecting that growth to moderate. It had a very strong Q4 of last year. But when you look at the run rate, we still feel very good about the run rate. So it\\'s less about level loading and manufacturing and it\\'s more about just comparables there. And we are expecting continued performance in both ACG and DGG, not necessarily at the double-digit rate. That would be good, but that\\'s not built into our guide. And as Mike said, we are expecting a flattish to slightly down in LSAG just given the strong 9% compare that we had in Q4 of last year. Maybe one on ACG for you, Mike, and I\\'m sure Mark can chime in. It was right in there with the best growth you guys have ever put up in that segment, even while facing a high single-digit comp. So how are you guys continuing to drive that segment to these levels of growth? I mean, it\\'s been years since you had that initial refocus. How are we still seeing follow through? What\\'s really driving the reacceleration demand? Yes. So I\\'ll take the congratulations on behalf of Mark, but then pass it on to Mark. But you\\'re exactly right. I can remember the early days. We were getting questions about when was this going to stop? And we said why would it stop? Because there\\'s a number of things doing and there\\'s also an expanding market underway. And as Mark pointed out, the strength was broad based across consumer services.  I mean, we really think we\\'re playing into -- and I tried to highlight this into my script, that really playing into some real changing customer needs. They really want something that\\'s going to help drive their productivity and they are also looking for at times vendors to take on some of the work they\\'ve been doing inside. And then, on the consumables front, they really want these integrated workflows. But I can\\'t do the strategy justice. So Mark, why don\\'t you fill in the pieces that I\\'ve missed. Thanks, Mike. And Patrick, I guess, maybe it\\'s a little bit of the past, but also the future, and we\\'re still very bullish about our potential to grow. But some of the drivers made really significant investments in the expansion of our portfolios. And from services, we\\'ve got breadth to now in more of our value-added services. And the enterprise capabilities that will not only have a rollout over the continuation this year and in the consumables business, it\\'s an intentional drive to drive for more complete workflows for targeted end markets. And we called out biopharma in particular, a high-growth market, where we\\'ve really been focused around grabbing that. So portfolio is a big driver. We\\'re really getting some great results from expanding our reach and our ability to wallet share growth inside of our current accounts to reach and lease subscriptions, still a lot of opportunity there. We still have a significant opportunity to improve our attachment rates to the Agilent instruments. But I always like to come back and remind everyone, we view our market not only as the Agilent installed base, but also the competitions. And that adds a significant size and scale to the market opportunity. And not only we can take market share from our competitions on a multi-vendor perspective, we are.  So to kind to sum it up. A lot of work that\\'s been done over the past, build a lot of capabilities from the standpoint of portfolio, digital, working on some fundamental basics around what we can do in the attachment rate from the sales channel and our big market opportunity out there. So hope that gives you a sense of where we\\'ve been, a little bit of where we\\'re going too. Yes. That\\'s helpful color. And then maybe just a quick one for Bob, on the share repurchase front. It was encouraging to see you guys step in and be opportunistic with the $550 million this quarter. How should we think about it going forward. Obviously, the market has pulled back a decent amount, your stock along with it. So maybe just provide some perspective on that front. Yes. Thanks, Patrick, and appreciate you acknowledging that. And we\\'ll continue to evaluate the market. Obviously, our focus is first on growth, and we\\'ll be closing the BioTek acquisition this quarter. And our M&A funnel continues to be strong, and we will be looking at that, but not afraid to go into the market if the price is right, so to speak. So I think the way that we are looking at that is first on M&A, and then looking to continue to deploy capital, where as I mentioned before, cash neutral right now with the acquisition of the BioTek, we\\'ll probably be at net debt of roughly onetime. And so we still have plenty of capacity there. Most of my questions have been asked. Just 2 things, for you, I guess. First, Mike, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more and provide any more color on some of the new products you recently launched and how they\\'re being accepted into the market, particularly the new GCs as well as the new iQ system. And then, I guess, secondly, for Bob or Mike if you want to take it, are you able to quantify how much you\\'re expecting in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter from the new NASD facility you\\'re starting up here? Yes. So if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll make some summary comments, then Jacob, you can just fill in some of the details. But last number, that\\'s our view on our new GC family launch was actually ahead of where we thought we\\'d be. And I think we\\'re doing well on the iQ as well. But -- and maybe you can kind of fill in some details there. Yes. Certainly, I think we are -- despite some challenging market conditions, we\\'re actually doing extremely well with the 88 series and in front of our -- on our own ramped volume. So I think that is working very well, and it\\'s really the combination of what we call the smart instrument combined with our already proven -- well proven technology, GC technology. And that really resonates with our customers. The same can actually be said with our iQ, which of course, a little -- only was introduced a few weeks ago out at the ASMS and we start to ship here very soon. We have received the first orders. But what I can say there is that it has been very well received where we have been out introducing it and presenting it to customers. I think they very much like the ease-of-use intuitiveness of the detector itself. And also, all the self awareness that it have. So it really helps the customer to be successful, not only successful, but also allow them to be -- you have much more uptime in a laboratory. And this really addresses the QA QC labs, where it\\'s all about being uptime and of course, get things with the laboratory. So it\\'s been really well-received, but it\\'s still early days for the iQ. So we have received orders, but we are shipping in this quarter here. Steve, just on NASD, it\\'s going to be, as we\\'ve said earlier in the year, it\\'s not going to be material to the overall numbers. So it\\'s going to be low single millions. Congrats on the quarter guys. I was hoping to ask a question back to China. Can you just provide some color on, like, what the actual generic business did in the quarter, like what the level of revenues was year-over-year? And then, while I appreciate, I think, to Tycho\\'s question you don\\'t want to give a specific number for 2020. But just given, I think, the investors in ourselves who are just trying to get some frame of reference, like directionally. Is there any help you can provide? Just as we go to 2020, I know you made a comment to Tycho, but just a little more help, if you could, directionally, on the food and the China generic side, how to think about that? Yes. So happy to, let me take the second part of that question first, which is when you think about the outlook for \\'20 again, well you know I\\'m going to stay way from percentage changes in growth rates. But I think we have a lot more confidence around where the generic side of that marketplace is going because we only have some proof points.  We\\'ve already seen, which is -- the thesis was in the second quarter, hey, we think this is going to lead to, ultimately, more business. But there was a pause in business. We actually saw that play out in the third quarter. And we think it will play out in the fourth quarter, where the winners are going to be buying the equipment. We think the same thing is going to happen in Q2 -- I mean, excuse me, FY \\'20. It will be more an FY \\'20 event in terms of what impacts the P&L because we know what the process, we know what\\'s going to happen. We know the winners who we have deep relationships with are going to invest. So I think we have a level of confidence about where that market is going. I don\\'t think the same thing can be said about the food market because that\\'s why I used the word foreseeable future. What we do now is the commercial side of that segment will continue to grow. That will continue to grow. It\\'s unclear right now what\\'s going to be happening relative to China\\'s desire to invest in the government labs. As you heard from Jacob earlier, right now, they\\'re prioritizing, for example, investments in environmental, and that\\'s why we\\'re seeing strong environmental growth. And Bob, maybe it\\'s worth just kind of parsing out. I was just thinking how our business is in -- I can\\'t give a specific number relative to generics. But just in terms of size of our pharma business in China, and then roughly how much of it is in the non-biopharma side. Yes. So our -- maybe just to comment on the food, Dan, on the -- on Q4, as I said earlier, we\\'re expecting it to be roughly that $40 million, which will be down year-on-year, pretty consistent with how we -- our results in Q2 and Q3. And the question is, over time, we do think that, that business will come back, not at the levels that had been in the past, just given the different dynamics. But the question is when and we\\'re not ready to call that yet. On the pharma side, the business actually did better in Q3 than it did in Q2. And of roughly China is roughly 20% of the overall business and pharma is about 30% of that -- 20%. So it\\'s about 6% overall. And it\\'s roughly 50-50 in terms of consumables and instruments. So it\\'s roughly 2% to 3% of our overall company. And in Q3, it grew. As Mike mentioned, really on the back of the winners of the 4+7 and just kind of clarity on what this pilot meant going forward. So that\\'s probably as much detail as we\\'re going to get into relative to this. And we\\'ll have another quarter under our belt for Q4 and then be better prepared to talk about it as things unfold for the fiscal year next, in November. Great. And if I could, since it is the last question. Just one more. Mike, obviously, a very strong quarter. You mentioned kind of similar to what you\\'ve been talking about. Obviously, we could see what\\'s going on, with continued uncertainty out in the marketplace, especially for, I think, for cap equipment. And Bob, you talked about PMIs, but you also talked about good book-to-bills and you had a good quarter. So any way to help us think about, like, as we try to tease out all the noise that\\'s out there in the marketplace, kind of what it means for Agilent on a go-forward basis, like PMIs, do we want that? Do we pay a lot to influence that? Or just any more color about the customer conversations you\\'re having, and kind of how it relates back to these comments. Sure. Yes. Happy to do so. So first thing I would do is I would set aside 60% of the business of Agilent, which is in the recurring revenue side of the business. And we talked a lot about the DGG business, the ACG business, and our view that we\\'re going to have continued strength there. And then, what we\\'ve been trying to do is position the business. Hey, listen, there is this 40% of the business, which is instruments. And that does -- it\\'s predicted by PMI. I think you may recall you and I have our conversation, but I think still some of the models still hold, which is the PMI trends do drive, to some extent, what\\'s going to happen ultimately in the capital goods side. I think we\\'ve already seen it. PMI started dropping earlier this year. Albeit there are some areas of Jacob\\'s business, which are still somewhat independent of that whether it will be the 4+7 initiatives, some policy changes, some of the things that happen in environmental, forensics. So I think its sort of a -- it\\'s a mixed model. So -- the first thing I\\'d do is start off by just saying, let\\'s set aside 60% of the business over here, and then start talking about the 40%, and then parse out the cell analysis piece, which is by itself is a high growing business driven by certain dynamics there. And then parse out some of the policy driven stuff, then you\\'re left with, primarily, chemical energy exposure. Bob how would you think about that? No. Maybe I\\'d just leave it here. I mean, I think we feel very good about our portfolio. Obviously, we can\\'t time the markets from the standpoint of market growth. But we think that we\\'re able to gain share in any market, and I think this quarter proves that. Our portfolio is strong. We continued to invest in areas that are faster growing than the overall company, things like cell analysis and then also our biopharma businesses across all three business groups. So I think Mike mentioned it in the prepared remarks that the business is a lot different than it was five years ago. And I think we continue to invest in fast-growing areas, continuing to transform it and make it a much more resilient model. And I think we feel good about that certainly for not only Q4, but going forward. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there’ll be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. And now, I’d like to introduce you to the host for today’s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent’s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent’s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob’s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent’s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent’s CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today’s discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today’s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of October 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. When I became CEO, I knew we had the opportunity to become a growth company. We would do this by investing in fast-growing markets with a building and buying approach. We also set out to create a more resilient company business model, capable of delivering strong earnings in a variety of market conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a roader base of growth and a more flexible and efficient cost structure. As you know, transforming a decades-old company is not an easy task, but I believed in the strength and determination of the Agilent team. The fourth quarter and full-year results I will share today are a testament to the commitment of the Agilent team and their ability to step up to meet this challenge. We strongly closed our fiscal 2019, with fourth quarter results exceeding our expectations. Agilent’s Q4 revenue of $1.37 billion is up 4% on a core basis against a 9% compare. And we have momentum going into 2020 as orders outpaced revenue. EPS of $0.89 is up 10% for the quarter. Both our top line revenue and EPS are above the high-end of our fourth quarter guidance. Operating margin of 25.1% is up 50 basis points over last year. Q4 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by the Agilent team. Our higher than expected top line is led by 10% core growth from our Agilent CrossLab Group. Business is also strong for our Diagnostics and Genomics Group, delivering 7% core growth. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets revenues are in line with expectations, down 2% against a 9% growth compare. The pharma, diagnostics and clinical, and the environmental and forensics markets continue to lead our growth. High single-digit U.S. growth is stronger than forecasted with other regions coming in as expected. Growth in China declined low single digits as expected. Agilent’s growth strategy of building and buying in fast-growing markets is on full display in Q4. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of BioTek. This is our largest acquisition since the launch of the new Agilent in 2015. BioTek brings a superb team and an excellent high-growth, highly profitable business to Agilent. The acquisition of BioTek complements our earlier acquisition this year of ACEA BioSciences. Both acquisitions are part of our growing cell analysis business serving biopharma and academic research customers. Agilent’s cell analysis business is now generating more than $250 million in annual revenue, about 5% of company revenues, and is growing at a double-digit rate. We are also continuing to invest internally to drive new organic growth. In Q4, we recognized the first revenue from our new oligo API manufacturing site in Frederick, Colorado. The high-quality, GMP grade oligos produced at this site are key to a new class of drugs being developed by our biopharma customers. Investing in this facility is part of our overall strategy to build a larger biopharma business. We are expecting continued strong growth in this business as we ramp volume throughout the coming year. Finally, in October, I traveled to the UK to open a new state-of-the-art facility at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. The site will be a major R&D hub for laser spectroscopy and will also incorporate Agilent’s Raman spectroscopy business. Our recent acquisitions and these capital investments in Colorado and the UK are very visible examples of our continued and relentless focus on investing for growth. Hey, let’s now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2019 results. We had a very solid year, generating $5.2 billion in revenue, representing 5% core growth. Strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics, and environmental and forensics markets led the way. Regionally, the U.S. set the pace, growing in the high single digits. The U.S. was followed by mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. Europe and China grew at low single digits for the year. Full-year earnings per share grew 11% to $3.11. The result is another year of double-digit earnings per share growth. The full-year operating margin of 23.3% is up 80 basis points over 2018, despite a full-year of tariff related duties. Our investments in ACG continue to yield dividends. ACG grew a stellar 10% for the year. We are helping customers transform their analytical lab operations by anticipating and meeting their evolving needs. DGG is also delivering very strong results, with 9% core growth for the year. We’re capturing market share in our pathology business, expanding our presence in next-gen sequencing and further building our oligo API business. During the year, DGG crossed the billion-dollar revenue threshold and now represents approximately 20% of Agilent’s business. LSAG revenues declined 1% on a core basis as we faced some market headwinds. We remain committed to investing for future LSAG growth and market share gains. Our new product development pipeline remains full. During the year, we introduced a number of innovative new products, including the launch of a new family of groundbreaking gas chromatographs and molecular spectroscopy instruments. At this year’s ASMS Conference, we introduced several new differentiated LC/MS offerings, including the 6546 LC-QTOF and 6495C LC triple-quad systems. As we head in 2020, our LSAG product portfolio and go-to-customer field team have never been stronger. Agilent continues to operate from a position of strength. We are well-positioned to capture market share. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model: deliver above market growth, while expanding operating margins, along with a balanced deployment of capital with a priority on investing for growth. The result, delivery of superior earnings per share growth. In driving value creation, we’ve built a broader base of growth and a more resilient business model. We were tested this year with economic and political uncertainties leading to subdued demand for new instrument purchases. Yet, we delivered 5% core growth, operating margins improved 80 basis points and delivered another year of double-digit EPS growth. We deployed more than $1.5 billion in M&A and growth-focused capital investments. On the M&A front, we’re very pleased with the performance to date of BioTek and ACEA BioSciences. We remain on the hunt for similar types of growth opportunities. I’m increasingly confident in the Agilent team’s ability to pursue larger-scale acquisitions and deliver on value creation synergies. We continue to review potential acquisitions as part of our building and buying growth strategy. Now more than ever, I’m convinced we’re in an exceptionally strong position for the future. This is particularly relevant as we move into 2020, a milestone for us at Agilent as we celebrate 20 years as an independent company. While uncertainties persist in some end-markets as we start fiscal year 2020, we’re operating from a position of strength. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, working as a One Agilent on behalf of our customers and shareholders. I’m very proud of the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. I know you’ve heard me say this before, but I truly believe the best is yet to come for Agilent, our customers and our investors. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. I mean, that was a Freudian  slip. I’ll now hand the call off to Bob. We don’t have a new CEO – CFO. Bob, you want to take it from here? Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I’ll provide some additional revenue detail and take you through the fourth quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I’ll then finish up with our guidance for 2020 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike indicated, our fourth quarter results were very good with strong execution throughout the P&L. For the quarter, revenue was $1.37 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 4%. Reported growth was stronger at 6%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by roughly 2 points, while acquisitions added 4 points to overall revenue, reflecting the impact of a partial quarter of revenue from the BioTek acquisition in addition to earlier acquisitions. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, had 7% core growth in the quarter, especially impressive off of a tough 14% comparison from last year. Our large molecule biopharma business and CrossLab strength continue to drive strong results. Geographically, all regions grew with the strongest growth in Americas and China. In speaking of China, despite the debate regarding the pharma market and the 4+7 program, our pharma business in China grew double digits for the year. Continuing revenue in the environmental and forensics market grew 9% in the quarter. This is against a very tough compare of 17% growth last year. Growth was balanced between LSAG and ACG and continues to be driven by evolving regulations, especially concerning opioids. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 7% during Q4, led by strength in our pathology and companion diagnostics businesses. Within pathology, continued expansion of our PD-L1 business was a key highlight. Revenue from the chemical and energy end market came in as expected, with 1% growth. Decline in instruments were offset by strength in the CrossLab’s business. Academia and government declined 4% against the tough compare of 10% growth last year. We still see the funding environments in academia and government remaining stable though. And finally, consistent with expectations, food revenue declines about 5% due to the China food market. Despite the year-over-year declines, we were encouraged that for the third quarter in a row, the run rate in China continues to be stable. On a geographic basis, the Americas came in stronger than expected with 9% growth during the quarter, led by strong results in the pharma, diagnostics and environmental markets. Europe modestly exceeded our expectations, delivering a 4% growth rate with balance strength across most markets and groups. China came in as expected, declining in the low single digits against a very strong compare of 16% growth last year. Excluding food, China was up slightly. In wrapping up, Asia ex-China declined low single digits. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 56.5%. This was down 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by product mix in LSAG, the start-up costs at our Frederick, Colorado site and a higher revenue mix from ACG. It’s reporting to remember that, while ACG’s gross margin is lower than the company average due to the services component, the ACG business has done a fantastic job of driving strong operating margin leverage. In fact, ACG’s operating margin led the company for the quarter and the year. So ACG is not only helping drive our recurring revenues, it’s doing so at a very accretive pace. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 25.1%, up 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage and strong expense management. The quarter also capped off full-year operating margin of 23.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.89, up 10% versus last year and $0.03 higher than the top-end of our guidance. And as Mike mentioned, our full-year earnings per share of $3.11 increased 11% versus last year. Now turning to some other financial metrics. For the quarter, we generated $314 million in operating cash flow. We acquired BioTek for $1.165 billion and returned $100 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Lastly in the quarter, we took advantage of market conditions and refinanced $500 million of senior notes early, producing our future interest costs. All in all, a very active quarter. Now before moving to next year’s guidance, I want to recap how we have deployed capital this year. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we plan to focus our capital deployment towards growth-oriented assets and driving returns to our shareholders. To that end, we’ve deployed over $2.3 billion this year: $1.4 billion in M&A for BioTek and ACEA and more than $900 million in share repurchases and dividends. And we ended the year with a very healthy balance sheet, allowing plenty of capacity for further capital deployment. Now let’s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the 2020 fiscal year, beginning with the full-year guidance. For the full-year, we’re expecting revenue to range from $5.50 billion to $5.55 billion, representing core growth of 4% to 5% and reported growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Currency is estimated to negatively impact growth by 0.3 percentage points with M&A contributing roughly 2.7 to 2.9 percentage points of growth for the full-year. From a group perspective, we expect ACG to sustain the momentum and deliver high single-digit growth, driven by broad-based strength. The DGG business is expected to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate with our NASD Frederick facility ramping throughout the year, and we anticipate a modest recovery for LSAG roughly flat on a core basis. Now moving down the P&L, we expect modest operating leverage. And also embedded in our forecast is we expect the other income and expense line to be roughly $40 million to $45 million in net expense, with year-over-year change driven largely by the interest expense as we enter the year in a net debt position. We expect our tax rate to improve by 50 basis points to slightly above 16% and our full-year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $312 million, essentially flat to Q4 of this year and reflecting only anti-dilutive share repurchases throughout the year. All this translates to non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $3.38 and $3.43 per share, resulting in 9% to 10% growth on a reported basis. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $775 million to $800 million. This includes a one-time tax outflow of roughly $230 million in the first quarter to transfer certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions. This tax will reduce our U.S. transition tax dollar-for-dollar and will provide us with operational and tax benefits in the future. We’ve also announced raising our dividend by 10%, continuing a streak of double-digit increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now turning into Q1 guidance. For Q1, we’re expecting revenue to range from $1.34 billion to $1.355 billion, representing reported growth of 4.3% to 5.5% and core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. The lower organic growth in Q1 reflects the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year, which this year falls into our fiscal first quarter. We anticipate this adversely affecting the growth rate in the first quarter by roughly 1 point. In addition, the growth rate takes into account the Frederick site ramp that will occur over the year. First Quarter 2020 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.81 per share, representing reported growth of 5% to 7%. EPS growth in Q1 is lower than the full-year based on the revenue growth, the Frederick start-up costs and certain share-based compensation costs that are expensed in the first quarter. Now before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are very pleased with the results our Agilent team was able to achieve this past year, while continuing to take focus on taking full advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We are positioning our business towards stronger secular growth markets and driving higher recurring revenue streams. We clearly saw the results of this in 2019 and we entered 2020 with a strong portfolio and with momentum. …and thank you for taking my questions. So maybe first with just a cleanup question. Did fiscal 2019 NASD revenue come in around $100 million as expected? And can you give us more detail on what you’re assuming for NASD revenue in 2020? I know you said you expect it to ramp over the course of the year. But if you actually gave a number, I might have missed that. Thanks, Doug. Yes, it came in generally in line a little better than that and we’re expecting very significant growth in FY 2020. Okay. So recognizing it, we don’t have a specific number, but just talking about it qualitatively and maybe taking everything up a level. You set the low-end of 2020 core revenue growth guidance at 4%. And this would be the – I think, the lowest core growth rate since at least 2011. And whatever that tailwind is from NASD, it makes the setting guidance at those levels even more notable. Based on what you guys just did in the quarter and the way you sound, that – it seems like you’re really just setting the bar at a level that embed some pretty conservative assumptions on the low-end. So I guess, specifically, would you guys be willing to talk about what conditions would need to exist for this scenario to become reality? Things like – at 4%, what are you assuming for China food? What are you assuming for 4+7 in terms of the downside risk there? And is there something you’re factoring in that would suggest there’s a scenario where things actually get worse in terms of overall global capital equipment demand? Yes. Thanks, Doug. Let me start and then Bob will jump in on this. So I think we don’t want to overthink this one. So this is our initial guide for the year. And you’re right, it would represent, if, in fact, that was an actual growth number – our loss growth rate in a number of years. But it’s just an initial guide, as you heard earlier, you heard a lot of words as expected with upside. So, we’re going to position our initial guide with the room for upside on the plan for the year. And… Yes, I would say, Doug, to build on what Mike was saying. I think we were taking a kind of a prudent approach to guidance. Obviously, if we were at that level, we’d be disappointed and something would happen in the macro economic environment that we’re not expecting. We’re not seeing anything right now that would suggest that the market conditions are getting any worse. This – that would suggest that market conditions probably would get worse and LSAG would not come back and it would continue to decline. But we’re, again, we’re at the beginning of the year there. Our – I think, we’re prudent here, but we like to believe that there’s a lot of opportunities for growth going forward. …hey, good afternoon. I’m wondering if you could talk on small molecule performance in the quarter. I know earlier in the year, you talked about a slowing global pharma business. Just curious how you’re thinking about the replacement cycle and was any of the instruments slowdown on the pharma side? In fact, Tycho, I think you’re – hey, Tycho, happy to jump in on this one and feel free Jacob to add your comments as well. But in Q2, we called out what seemed to be a slowing replacement cycle – replacement level in the generic side or small molecule side of the Pharma segment. We really haven’t seen any evidence of that in the third and fourth quarter. And as Bob mentioned in the script, we had double-digit growth in pharma, 4+7 initiative, which is heavily focused on small molecule is not impacting our business. We put a really solid numbers. And I think we’re seeing the growth in small molecule fairly healthy, along with higher levels in the biopharma side. But really the pressure on the instrument side really on a growth rate perspective has really come in the food segment, primarily in China as well as the global chemical energy market. And, Jacob, I don’t know if you have anything else you’d like to add there? Mike, I think you have covered a lot of it. The only thing to add there is that, we, as you mentioned, but – that we do see the growth in the QA/QC environment, maybe less in the discovery from small molecules. But we continue to expect that volume will be there and continue to increase in the small molecules going forward also. Okay. And then, Mike, for your commentary on C&E, for instruments, are you assuming any recovery next year on the instrument side? No. That’s basically flat, kind of basically flat conditions. So – and back to the question, Doug, you asked earlier, if we would see some improvement in the chemical energy that would really represent upside to our our initial guide. So we’re assuming kind of continued conditions. They’ve been challenged this year. So we’re assuming they continue into FY 2020, no change there. But if it would change the positive that would be upside to our current plan. And I think the resilience of our model really showed in this past quarter and the full-year, which is, while chemical industry is down on the instrument side, we actually had some modest growth there when – with the aftermarket side of our business. Okay. And then one quick one for Bob, just to close on the M&A comments. Can you just remind us your framework? Are you still assuming $1 billion-ish type deal would be the ceiling where we’re obviously getting the question a lot as other analysts? No, no, let me take that one. If it wasn’t clear in the script, I actually explicitly said that we’re increasingly confident on our ability to take on larger-scale acquisitions and deliver on value creation and synergies. I would not put a ceiling like that on our appetite for deals. Yes. Yes, we are still committed to being investment grade. Obviously, being ending the year at roughly a little less than one-time net debt levered. That gives us a lot of opportunity to – if the right deal were there to kind of lever up with the commitment to kind of paying back down. Now, again, we’re going to be remained financially disciplined and focused on returns, but we do have a fair amount of room there. Mike or Bob, could you give us any color in terms of what you’ve penciled in for China for fiscal 2020? And to sort of speak to your level of visibility in the food business and perhaps some early traction that you might be getting with some of those private labs? Yes. Yes, I’ll start and then Mike, or perhaps, Jake, if you wanted to add anything. We are expecting a modest recovery in China next year. We ended this year at roughly 1%, a large part of that being the headwinds that we’re seeing in food. We’re expecting that China to become kind of low single digits to mid high, or mid single digits, depending on kind of that food recovery. We have some – the good news is, over the last three quarters, we’ve been roughly averaging this $40 million per quarter that we talked about. So we’re on this trajectory of – in China being $160 million kind of run rate. And our expectation is that, we’ll continue to – we’re not going to speculate growth there, but be at that level next year, which will help the rest of the business grow. So we will – because we won’t have that headwind. Yes, I think it’s really important that we define what do we mean by recovery, which mainly means continue at the flat level it’s been running for the last three quarters, about $40 million a quarter. And just to put a number on this, I believe, Bob, about 4 points of our growth in China this year was impacted by the food market. So we fast forward, you could do the math and said, okay, it would just stays flat with what we’ve seen for the last three quarters. You’d expect that we would grow above what we’ve grown this year in China. And then to your question about the contract testing side, Jacob, I think it’s high single-digit growth there. So… Yes. We – I was actually recently here in China. And clearly, the private labs are doing quite well. We see strong growth now from a different base than where we are on the government labs. But even with the government labs and certain types are – there are certain some investments going in, but not to the level that we’ve seen before. So that’s why we don’t see a lot of movements right now. We won’t. Thanks. And a follow-up for Bob. Could you just elaborate a little more color on the tax hit, the one-time tax hit on the cash full on you expect in the first quarter? And kind of the mechanics of what it relates to in terms of the intangibles, reclassification, and any implications it might have for the tax rate beyond next year? Thanks. Yes. So it is a one-time opportunity that we have afforded ourselves. We’re moving some intangible property out of one of our acquisitions into our tax model. It’s going to require us to pay the $230 million upfront in taxes, but that’s going to be creditable to our already existing liability for our U.S. transition tax. And so it’s effectively a one-for-one kind of credit there. So it’s not an incremental cost to us over time. And what it allows us to do by putting this – it’s related to the Dako acquisition. It allows us to streamline our operational activities, as well as overtime, generate some tax benefits. That will likely happen in 2021 and beyond, so it’s part of our kind of multi-year tax planning initiatives that we’ve been talking about. …Mike, maybe a big picture question. I just – if I think about where PMIs are, I think, PMIs are bottoming out. But from your commentary, I guess, what you’re saying is, you’re still expecting whatever trends we saw for 2019 as a base case, you’re assuming those trends continue into next year. I’m just curious PMIs are bottoming out, why is that a reasonable assumption going forward? I want to see the orders first. So – and back – getting back to the earlier question about guide, that’s why we went into level we did, which was, if you go back and look at Agilent’s overall results for 2019, they really were quite strong. But the growth came from different parts of the businesses than we expected. And we’re sitting in Q2 and Q1 last year, PMIs started dropping, and you see – saw a level of conservatism in our customer-buying behavior. So we said, okay, there’s reason to believe to your point that it could actually be a different environment in 2020. Let’s not guide assuming that. Let’s just – let’s see it happen and then we’ll take up the guide appropriately and take the orders of business. Yes. I think, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Mike is saying. I mean, what we’re trying to do like everyone else is kind of read the tea leaves. And our best view is that, until we start seeing something different that it’s going to remain the same as it is today. And if it does rebound, that would be good. We would like that. Yes. That – that’s helpful, guys. And then, Bob, one quick question on operating leverage. It looks like the guide is contemplating modest operating leverage, maybe 30, 35 basis points for next year. I’m just – I mean, that Q4 performance, this is really impressive what you guys did on the OpEx side. Any thoughts on why maybe leverage for next year, Rob, moderates a little bit? Is that maybe a little bit more spend to – on the growth initiatives you guys have? Yes, some of it is that and we have a full-year of the Frederick costs that are going to be built into the results in 2020 that we didn’t have. We really just had that in Q4. And obviously, Q4 is one of our strongest years of – our strongest quarter. So we get a lot of leverage there. But we feel pretty good about that. And I think we’ve demonstrated this year an ability to manage our operating expenses to continue to drive double-digit growth on the earnings side and continue to drive operating margin leverage. So I think, you should feel confident that we’ll continue to do that going forward. Hi, Mike, thanks for the time here, again. A few things I’d like to tie up. I mean, Mike, I wonder if first, you might elaborate a little bit on a point that you made in your prepared remarks. When you said that orders in the quarter actually grew, I believe faster than revenue. I wonder if you could talk about where you’re seeing acceleration? And to what extent, if any particular region, maybe Japan was a driver there knowing there are some tax incentives in Japan? Thanks. Thanks for doing that. We thought it was really important to give the audience a view of the order activity in the quarter. We typically don’t like to plan – we typically don’t comment on that. But given the Q1 guide and some of the nuances around Lunar New Year and such, I want to let you – let the audience know that we ended the year in a strong backlog position, but the orders really exceeding the amount of revenue for the quarter. And I’d say, the quarter in orders was very similar to the quarter in terms of the revenues that you saw, which was strength in the Americas, strengthen in pharma from an end market, very strong results in ACG, DGG, cell analysis. So – and then the environmental side continues to put up really great numbers off of double-digit compares. So I think the Q4 order book was very similar in terms of pattern and areas of strength that we saw on the revenue side that I commented in my script. Yes. Steve, to more specifically to your question on Japan, we did not see any one-time build there, that was at the end of the fiscal year. Our fiscal quarter actually was across that, that timeframe. So we saw normal growth in Japan, which actually speaks to kind of the broad-based strength that Mike was just talking about. Okay, great. Very helpful. And then just, let’s say, two very quick points to tie up with the model. I guess one on NASD. I know you don’t want to give a specific number as it relates to what the contribution on revenues might be for fiscal 2020. But could you spend a minute just on how close you are to getting capacity there booked up? And when you think it – whether it’s 2021 or 2022, we might see the Frederick location running closer to that incremental capacity and then actually, I’ll tie it up right there? Thanks, again, for all the help. …from the question earlier, in the Q&A, we felt very good about kind of where we ended up the year. We had very strong growth. And we ended up, as I mentioned, slightly above the $100 million. And as we had talked about before, there was $100 million of capacity that would be ramping up over the course of the year. Many folks have modeled kind of a $50 million number and that’s in the ballpark. And in the ramp is really dependent upon how the clinical trials go and so forth. And so, maybe I’ll turn it over to Sam, to talk about kind of some of the dynamics, but obviously, some very positive things that have happened in the market just recently. Yes, Bob, I think you you’ve already laid the groundwork. Steve, how are you? We continue to be excited about the NASD business. And Boulder, just to remind you, is an ongoing important part of our NASD capacity capability there. And there have been some announcements recently, you might have seen that they just really reaffirmed what’s in our plan, the ability to grow and support the growing demand in the market for our customers. So Bob, really, I don’t have a lot to add to what you already said. We expect by the time we exit the year and you’re running… So, Mike, maybe just on China, if you don’t mind. China, you said pharma grew double digits in the quarter in China. But could you just spike out the generic issue there? And kind of how did generics specifically do in the quarter? And maybe kind of what’s assumed in 2020 versus what you achieved in 2019 with generics there? Yes. How about if I used the word 4+7 in that whole segment, excuse me, that whole segment of small molecule, I think it was up double-digit for us. Yes. I mean, as Mike mentioned, we after the first 4+7 around and the winners were announced, we certainly also see we are market leader in that space and that by we have access to many of those customers out there. So we, of course, in demand from those customers also. That would be more 4+7 or more activities in that space. But generally, speaking, we feel that we have a quite good predictability in that market now. Yes. Dan, I think that actually played out the way we had thought during the year. Once the initial announcements were done and tendering process started, the whole market pause for us to release a good quarter. And then as we had thought would happen is the – once the winners were announced and we were actually over-indexed in those accounts, so we had already preexisting strong relationship with those customers. Then we would see this return to growth we saw it in Q3 and we saw it in Q4, and we think the – that momentum is with us as we move into 2020. Yes. I think Dan, this is Bob. Just to build on what Mike and Jake were saying. I think what we’ve seen is kind of the notion of the higher quality, higher volumes and our ability to provide not only instrumentation, but the consumables and the software associated with that to keep up time in the lab is really resonating with our customers. And so I think the combination of both the LSAG business and the ACG business is a true, what we think is a competitive differentiator across this, and this is a proof point for us. Great. Thank you for that. And then maybe back on C&E, I know, I think the Tycho’s question, Bob – Mike, excuse me, I think, you discussed instruments, maybe flat is the way to think about the outlook from here conservatively? Can you just maybe speak to kind of what the interest level is like from the Intuvo and then the two larger instrument platforms today? And kind of what are the guideposts towards when maybe we could see that instrument demand pickup? Because I assume there has to be some good latent demand for the new instruments. Yes. In fact, we’re already seeing that. So it’s actually when you dig into the details on the order book and the revenue results, in fact, we just had a review last week with Jacob on his ramp to volume. And he knew, the new 8890 and 8860 GCs are actually – it’s – on the dashboard, it shows green being head of our internal ramp to volume forecast. So we think that it’s already happening. And then other parts of the instrument portfolio, so the chemical energy aren’t seeing the same type of demand. But this shows you when you come out with a new set of offerings, the marketplaces have a clear value proposition to customers that drives productivity even in a market environment, where capital is a little bit tighter, you can get the order. And, Jacob, I know you’ve been out with some customers recently, but if you could anything else you’d like to add to that? Yes, absolutely. I think the 88 series really resonate with the customer base. And even though, it is a muted environment, we do see that there is interest and we do see, as you know, that we have a really strong ramp to volume. But the customer really like about it is that, we continue with the highest quality and highest performance in the market, but now also with a lot of what we call smart performance in the instruments – a lot of intelligence. So with instrument actually knows what it’s doing and it can put predictive maintenance in. In fact, we put out something that’s called smart alerts now that customers are really excited about that they can get an overview over their labs and get access to what’s actually happening instruments, so they can be predictive in their expectations. Hey. So actually, I wanted to follow on with that question thinking about the GC cycle and the upgrade. How much – can you estimate about how much the installed base was upgraded over the last few years. Now you’ve got a very big GC platform installed globally. Just curious in terms of where we are in the cycles once it picks up again? Yes. We have – generally speaking, when we look into our refresh cycle, we do see that the market is looking at approximately 10% per year of refresh. So that also means that our instruments is out there for quite a long time. We are actively looking into that. We we do see – we actually believe that we are in the middle of a refresh cycle. It has been challenged with the overall market conditions. So we do believe actually when the market is coming back to when the PMI are starting to turn that that we would see an acceleration in that refresh cycle. I think it’s fair to say to Jacob, there’s always, if you will, a replacement going on. Just – how much has actually been replaced. And I think we continue to see fairly high levels of aging in the installed base, which would point to perhaps somewhat of an acceleration of the replacement rate, assuming the market environment would improve. Yes. Yes. Hey, Derik, one other thing that I think is probably pertinent here, it’s still early days. But when – if you recall, the launch is both at the high-end and the mid range. And what we really excited about was the potential to have a really compelling offering at the mid range, where we had not as much penetration as we did at the high-end. And while Mike was talking about our ramp to volume, Mike and Jake were talking about a ramp to volume being green for the business if you kind of parse them out. I would say the mid price or the mid value range is dark green. And so, once the China food business starts to snap back or come to pick up, again, I guess, can you – how should we think about that business? I mean, is there going to be a V-shaped curve since rebound is the latent demand there or is it going to be – is that market going to be a little bit less than we had grown in the past just given some new organizations in that market? Yes. I think we won’t see the type of double-digit declines we saw this year. As Jacob mentioned on the actual volume side, the number of samples being run is up double-digit. The money has been down sharply at the central government level. We don’t expect that’s going to be the long-term situation. So right now for 2020, again, we’re just saying it’s going to be flat with the level we’ve seen for the last three quarters. That being said, our internal view is that this is kind of a mid single-digit kind of grower. It’s going to – I mean, the China market itself is going to be least 6% to 8% growth rate and this is probably about where this business could be. It won’t be at the toward double-digit growth that is seen for the past decade. That being said, you won’t see these double-digit declines that we experienced in 2019. That’s why when we talk about a modest recovery in China really is, we’re just talking about lapping the compare on the food – from the food business. One final question. I mean, you’ve done a lot of acquisitions in the cell biology space recently. And admittedly, I’m a molecular biologist by training, I’m a cell biologist. So can you help me understand what you’re offering that’s novel in terms of how you put all these pieces together? And just sort of what are you bringing to market to customers that hasn’t been brought there before? I’m just trying to get a better understanding of sort of like the opportunity here. And along those lines, like do you need a broader molecular biology portfolio to continue to drive into that market? Thank you. Yes, happy to do that, Derik. So I want to make some initial comments and Jacob is knee deep into this business, and he can share with you some of the things that really differentiate ourselves here. So, I think we first got started down this journey with the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. We really felt that was a really good first point with a differentiated offering with novel, unique technology that nobody had. But we also felt that we needed to have some more scale to be much more formal in the space. After the recent acquisition of ACEA Biosciences and the acquisition of BioTek, the $250 million-plus, we think we’ve got the scale. And we’re also very selective in terms of the types of companies we look at, the teams, the profile of the portfolio, so I think we’ve got something really especially that it differentiated. And Jacob, why don’t you talk about what we’re doing about the workflows and some other things? Yes, absolutely. So I’m certainly excited about our opportunity in the cell analysis space. And what I think is that two dynamics going on. First of all, with the recent rise of immune-oncology that we first play out in  now in the cell analysis also. And then, of course, generally speaking, immunology, that there’s a lot of interest in that space right now. And it really requires technologies that allow for life cell analysis, both from an imaging perspective, but also measuring the activity in the life cells. And those are the technologies that we’re providing between the BioTek, the Seahorse, the ACEA and the lots of technologies. So where we really differentiate is, first of all, the seahorse and ACEA Technologies are very differentiated understanding on their own, while BioTek have a very broad portfolio, including some very excited imaging technologies. But we have not bring them together in workflow settings, where you can use basically the multi techniques to look at cell from many different angles and provide much deeper insight based on one informatics platform that nobody else can do in the market. So that I think that’s really where we differentiate versus competition. And one of the things, Derik, we looked at was, we had already been working, for example, between the BioTek team and the CRS team actually have been working together prior to the acquisition. And we had proof points based on incremental business we had, which was customers really didn’t want to have independent instrumentation and data systems that really haven’t integrated software, integrating these workflows and really was – really had a differentiated value to customers, and they saw that was very important to them and they were willing to give us the business as a result. First question is Mike and Bob, you guys have touched on China several times already. But maybe we can talk a little bit about assumptions concerning other geographies in 2020? Are they any different than what you’re currently seeing in terms of both current business, as well as wall to your order book? Thanks. Yes, yes. No, that’s a great question, Bill. So let me kind of walk you through kind of how we’re thinking about the various markets. So we would expect that the Americas would continue to kind of lead the pace with kind of high single-digit growth. Europe, probably low single-digit growth going forward, pretty consistent with kind of how we’ve seen this year kind of play out. And the rest of Asia, excluding China being in kind of in that low to mid single-digit growth. And so that’s kind of how we’re thinking about China. And China would be low to mid, yes. Got it. And then, Mike, to elaborate on an earlier comment that you made about tighter capital, can you just talk about how broadly you’re seeing that? Oh, I think that comment was related to conditions we saw in 2019, that – and my comment really was, even when there’s tighter capital, which is what we saw with lower PMIs throughout this year, customers are still willing to invest when you have a solution that helps them with their bottom line, their productivity, as well as their scientific results. So what I’m saying is, there’s a path forward to getting more business, even when capital is tight. Okay. So you’re not suggesting obviously then that there’s some sort of lack of availability, it really has to do with, if you have the right product, you can find it? …the – your position in biopharma, specifically a large molecule is what portion do you think of the business today? And where would you like that to be, I guess, would be a good color? Thank you. Yes, happy to do so, Paul. And as Bob mentioned, we’ve been having – we have strong pharma results, again, this quarter. This has been kind of consistent story for Agilent over the last several years. During that period of time, we’ve been consistently growing our biopharma portion, our large molecule portion of that business double-digit. I think, a couple years ago was probably maybe about 15% of our pharma business. Now it’s up to probably north of 20% and we think that rate will continue. It’s not because the other side has been shrinking, it’s because we think we’ve been obviously investing very heavily, either through new instrument platforms, marked on some acquisitions in this area. So while we don’t have a specific percentage in mind, I would expect every time I start talking you through the coming years, you’re going to see a higher part of the – of our business in biopharma. In fact, when we come out to – at the conference again this year, we’ll probably talk more specifically about the entirety of our biopharma business. I dropped a lot of comments today about NASD and some cell analysis. So a lot of stuff ultimately comes in into a lot of us into the biopharma end market. We often think about biopharma business just being associated with LC and LCMS, but there’s a lot more to the story. Okay. And on the academic side, it was soft. What was specifically did do you see going on in the U.S. market in the quarter? We dug into this, honestly, it’s probably worth calling. And as best we can see really was just about the strength of the business we had last year, I think it was about over 10% growth last year. So nothing really is really changing in that environment and continue to see very solid and stable funding environment. Sometimes there’s seasonality a bit with that business, but I think that’s really all we could really saw them. That’s right. I mean, that business is one of our smaller businesses, and it can be kind of lumpy and so forth and had a very strong Q4. So this appears to be another quarter of growth in CrossLab. So wondering what continues to be the strength there. What’s your confidence there longer-term? And it’s consistently about 8% growth for the – I mean, now, last three years. And so should we expect similar expectation here going forward into – and despite LSAG instruments being flat for the year, as you pointed out in your remarks, should we expect CrossLab’s longer-term to continue to do well, knowing that some of the instrumentation is being flat and with the consumables and service contracts will continue to grow? I’m happy to comment on this. This is a real success story, I think of the new ads and we architect this strategy a couple of years ago. And we – I can recall, getting this question almost every year when we had an 8% or 9% print, hey, when’s it going to end? And we would say, it’s not going to end. We think that what’s going on here is really you have changing customer needs and you need to anticipate what’s going to happen and provide a new set of services and capabilities. really help them with the economics on the lab in addition to the scientific results. So today, I think this – and I hope it came through in the call script, which was we said, we really have demonstrated this new business model this year, where we can have strong growth in ACG, irrespective of whether or not the business in our new instrument side is as strong as we’d like it to be. So, as Bob said, the guide for next year, we’re quite confident in our ability to continue this high single-digit kind of growth. The services proposition we have and what we offer is really what we’re resonating with customers. You heard, Jacob commenting a little bit on some of the work that goes on between Mark’s team and Jacob’s team to develop new capabilities around our instrument platforms, which leads into a set of new revenue streams on our services side. And on the consumer side, it’s been both a story of organic growth, but also continuing to add more to the portfolio through acquisitions. So I think we’re really quite confident about our ability to continue this high single-digit growth rate really tied in also to how we’re enabling business differently on a digital perspective. So I hope it’s coming through that we’re highly confident about our – what we build and where this business is going to go in the future. …just one other thing is, we’re talking about this. If you looked at just the attach rates, we’ve got a number of programs that are driving increased attach rates. We have – we think we have a lot of room to continue to grow there. And I think the one thing that we’ve seen this year is actually, as Mark and team have offered more services and more solutions, we’re actually seeing for the instruments that we are placing actually higher value… ...tied to the service offerings. So we’re actually being able to create more value on a per box basis, given the portfolio that we’ve been able to derive. So there’s a lot of opportunity there. Jacob talked about some of the smart alerts and so forth, but we’re building this intelligence in. But in addition, we’re actually creating more value when an instrument is sold and actually increasing the service component. Okay, thanks. And if I could check on Dako, could you elaborate the contribution there on the quarter? I don’t know if you provided that and what’s your expectation that you’re breaking there for 2020? Yes. I think we didn’t provide a specific number for me. But if you saw my comments, we talked about gaining market share in pathology and we’ve got a high single-digit growing business in DGG. And though a lot of today’s call has been focused on the growth rate from NASD. Pathology is the largest business in that group and it’s doing well. Okay. And if I could squeeze in the last question on, Mike. When we look at the last couple of years, pulling back a little bit higher level. In terms of instrument launches, you had Intuvo, Ultivo, 8800 series, a number of launches. And this would be about the time we would be seeing a benefit from those. So is the message here that those instruments continue to gain strong traction in the market? And it’s just the end markets that are sort of challenging you and the government dynamics in China, or is there any – anything more to that we should be looking into in terms of the instrumentation? And just give us, if you could take a moment and give us a sort of a view into the new instrument sort of outlook longer-term and how should we think about Agilent in that framework? Thank you. Thanks, Puneet. I couldn’t have said it better myself, which is our product portfolio has never been stronger. We have had a continuing cadence of products, whether it’d be liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, LCMS, GCMS, molecular spectroscopy, the story just continues. So if there has been any softness relative to expectations in LSAG results, it’s all been some of the market environment conditions that you’ve described. And the fact that we’ve been able to continue to invest. We have invested in our field team, as well as I know, some of my competitors are pulling back their reins a bit, where we think we’re capturing share, we think we’re well positioned for – when some of these end markets start to turn to back to back to growth. We’ve seen some of these cycles before in the past. So I think the – and then I made a comment in my script about the product pipeline being full, which is what that was an indication of it. We have other projects. So we’re not going to introduce a bunch of instruments and then disappear for half a decade, you’re going to have a continuing cadence of products, new products, upgrades. So we feel like our NPI process is really humming right now. Hey, so I can’t believe I got this far in the call. But I wanted to ask how is the early integration of the BioTek acquisition going? And maybe can you also elaborate on the pacing of the revenue contribution? When I look at the fourth quarter, the acquired growth was about a point better than I was looking for in terms of the incremental growth and the first quarter is about a point shy of what I was looking for, was there any movement there? I’ll take the last one and then I’ll turn it over to Jacob for the integration piece. So yes, we – in simple terms, we had talked about $20 million to $25 million worth of revenue. It was slightly better – it was better than that in the quarter. Going into Q1, the ACEA Biosciences acquisition moves into core. So that’s why it looks a little lower. It shows up as part of our core growth. In Q4, both ACEA and BioTek were in the M&A number. And as I mentioned in my script, we’re very pleased with how the – we are on the early days in BioTek and Jacob, maybe just want to add a few comments. We just – we’ve had a big meeting with the field team few weeks ago, so… Yes, exactly. I think the integration couldn’t have been better so far. I think we are really spending time on learning, of course, BioTek and they spend time learning us both from what processes we’re using, but also from a cultural perspective, we continue to be very excited about the team that we’re getting on board and how they fit well with the Agilent culture. So I’m very excited. Obviously, over the next year, we’re going to integrate them. But – and – but I’m continuing to see a lot of momentum in the combined cell analysis business. Okay, thank you. I was talking to myself for a second. Just follow-up I was hoping if you could give us a mark-to-market on Lasergen, I think you’re expecting first placements in the second-half of this year at the last Analyst Day. Just how is the progress going there? Yes. So technically, Sam, I think we’ve really been quite pleased with the progress and we’re not ready to call out intro date for the RUO unit yet? That’s right, Mike. We are making good technical progress in terms of the specifications that are pushing technology. And we are executing on our development roadmap and we’re not ready to share specifics on the launch date just yet. I would say, Jack, this is Bob. Our guidance doesn’t comprehend any revenue there. And even back in the original guidance, there was no material revenue in 2020. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Agilent Technologies Q3 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.

Thank you for joining us on today’s call. I will start with a summary of our Q3 performance. Then I’ll move to an update and outlook on operating margin expansion and capital deployment plans. Finally, I will close with our full-year guidance. I am very pleased to report our Q3 results, with the Agilent team delivering revenue at the high-end of our guidance and earnings above our guidance range. Agilent’s Q3 revenue of $1.01 billion grew 1% over a year ago, up 9% on a core basis. Orders of $953 million, while down 6% compared to a year ago, were up 3% on a core basis. Our strong revenue growth was driven by continued strength in the pharma, diagnostics, environmental and forensics markets, and across all geographies. We saw strong customer acceptance of our new instrument product introductions, and strength in our CrossLab services and consumables, diagnostics and genomics offerings. We also resolved previous start-up issues in our Americas Logistics Center, which delayed $15 million of shipments last quarter. A few additional comments on the order front, our 3% core growth was against a tough compare of 9% growth in Q3 ’14. We also experienced some U.S. and state government big deal delays into Q4, and customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in like a weak -- in light of weak commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economies. Adjusted operating margin, including the adjustment for Keysight billings, was 19.9%, expanding 110 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.44. This marks another quarter of significant year-over-year margin improvements, driven by our intense focus on growing our operating margin, as we seek to achieve 22% margins by fiscal 2017. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent’s analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth of 9% was driven by strong performance in Pharma, environmental and forensics markets. Core orders were down 1%. LSAG operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. The previously announced exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. We expect our LSAG sales funnels to continue to strengthen, given a number of recent significant new product introductions. At June’s HPLC 2015 Conference in Geneva, we further enhanced our new Infinity II LC line with the new 1290 Infinity II Vial-Sampler. This product significantly lowers the entry price to the top-line product range, offering analytical laboratories a cost-effective way to experience the advantages of ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography. We released the 6470 LC/MS Triple-Quad at ASMS in June. This newly engineered core platform provides attogram-level sensitivity, and accurate quantitation with up to six orders of linear dynamic range. The new product delivers significant improvements to the best-selling core LC/MS Triple-Quad, the 6460. It offers improved performance, precision, speed and robustness; and features a small footprint to preserve bench space in the lab. And in spectroscopy, the 7800 quadrupole ICP-MS, which we launched in Q2, is the latest addition to Agilent’s industry-leading ICP-MS portfolio. This new product raises the standard for routine elemental analysis. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables businesses under a new Agilent brand. Core revenues were up 8%, while core orders grew 6% in the quarter. Operating margin was 22.6%. Last quarter, we launched the Agilent CrossLab Brand Promise program. This program is focused on delivering a new and integrated approach that offers actionable insights to help customers. New service solutions include laboratory business intelligence reporting, RFID inventory management services, and laboratory asset utilization services. And in consumables, we expanded our AdvanceBio portfolio of solutions, which enables scientists to speed research and lower costs. Finally, turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions: the former Dako business, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions. DGG’s results were driven by excellent performance across all three divisions, pathology and companion diagnostics, genomics and nucleic acid businesses. DGG’s core revenue grew 10% versus a year ago. Orders grew 8% on a core basis. Operating margin of 16.8% was up 330 basis points over Q3 of fiscal year 2014. In the third quarter, DGG completed its acquisition of Cartagenia, a leading provider of software for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. We launched updated Gene Expression Microarray tools for researchers to better investigate expression patterns on a highly accessible platform. Adding to products for next generation sequencing, we released new Target-Enrichment Solutions for disease research, which will address current limitations in exome sequencing. Now, let’s take a brief look at Agilent’s revenue by end market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continued to see strength in pharma, a recovery with strong demand in the diagnostics and clinical market, and moderate growth in academia and government. Applied end-market performance was led by continued spending in environmental and forensics, and moderate growth in food. Chemical and energy was flat, due to reduced investments in oil exploration. We also saw cautious spending in downstream refining and chemical segments, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty concerns. Geographically, we saw healthy core revenue growth across all regions, particularly in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, with strong growth in China. Major pharma spending was brisk, with large firms upgrading to the new Infinity LC platform. Turning from the report out of Agilent’s revenue and order results, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q3 capital deployment actions and outlook. Thanks to those of you on the call who joined us at our May Analyst and Investor Meeting. As a reminder, I highlighted three focus areas where we are working as a team to drive shareholder value: deliver above-market revenue growth, expand operating margins to historic highs and return 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. I’ve just discussed our revenue growth. Now here’s an update on our operating margin and capital deployment. Our multi-year “Agile Agilent” program is re-engineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. As of the third fiscal quarter, we have delivered $35 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We are committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY ‘17, a three point improvement over FY ‘14, while continuing to invest for long-term revenue growth. With the margin improvement results over the past two quarters, we are very confident in our ability to deliver on our margin expansion goals. Now turning to capital deployment. As previously guided, we are on track to return $500 million this year to shareholders in the form of dividends and buy backs. In Q3, we repurchased $99 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $267 million. With respect to guidance, we are reaffirming our previous FY 2015 EPS guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, as the operating model of the new Agilent continues to drive profitable growth and margin expansion. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional details on our guidance and financial results. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures were respectively 3% and 9%. This quarter, currency subtracted 6.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. And as Mike stated, start-up issues with the transfer of U.S. distribution center were resolved in Q3, which resulted in about $15 million of additional revenue. Finally, adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, 160 basis points higher than our guidance and 110 basis points higher than last year on just 0.5% higher nominal revenues. Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Agilent/Keysight split, operating margin grew 210 basis points. I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.49. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.7% on a core basis and our 20.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 40 basis points sequentially. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program with planned purchases of $98 million in Q4. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.6% on a core basis, again, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures. Fiscal year \\'15 revenue guidance is $37 million lower than previous guidance, of which $15 million is due to currency. Our EPS guidance of $1.70 at midpoint is unchanged from previous guidance, due to additional Agile Agilent savings that compensated for slightly lower revenues. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 19.2% or 40 basis points higher than last year. Excluding the impact of the $40 million cost dis-synergies related to the Agilent/Keysight split, our operating margin will be 140 basis points over previous year, on flat reported revenue growth. Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your book-to-bill. I think I’m calculating a 0.94, which is the lowest you’ve had in years. So I wonder if there\\'s any additional color to be offered there. Yes. I’m looking at Didier in the conference room here. I think that number is correct. And we had very, very strong Q3 revenue. And as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to have our growth rate pick up as we have -- are expecting a number of areas of strength in the marketplace, such as pharma, the diagnostics, the environmental forensic space that I talked about earlier continue to be quite strong. And we\\'ve had a lot of new product introductions. Our sales funnels are building. And we’ve seen really strong win loss ratios of that new business. And sometimes orders can be a little bit lumpy. So we do see some big deals moving between quarters, which we saw here in the third quarter on the state and federal level in United States. And I would just also point out we had a tough compare when we look at kind of the results for the third quarter. No absolutely, not. I think we have a lot of reasons to be positive about the outlook. And other thing I did not mention, Dan, was that, we got off to a slow start in the third quarter in incoming orders after finishing so strong in Q2. But throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration of incoming orders throughout the quarter and finished the quarter strong. Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, would be interested in getting some more granularity on just how China performed in the period, how the book-to-bill ended there? And what you perceive the implications of the currency revaluation are to your profitability there? And just remind us whether you price in local currency or in USD? Yes. Sure. I mean, great question. I figure we\\'d probably spend some time today talking about China, given some of the recent news. But in terms of our performance in China in the third quarter, we have very strong revenue growth with low-double digits. And we’re tracking through the first three quarters right on the plans. We\\'ve talked about with all of you at the analyst meeting the high-single digit level of growth in China. In terms of the areas of strength, we’re continuing to see strength in pharma, life science, research, the diagnostics, food, environmental. And the business really continues to develop as we had expected, albeit some of the recent changes, which in terms of how that affects our profitability in China, it\\'s really neutral. We’re naturally hedged in China in terms of both the amount of revenues that we bring in, in China. Even though it is our second largest country in terms of revenue, we also have a very large footprint there, including local manufacturing. So we are naturally hedged in China. And in terms of your question around the mix of RMB versus dollars, about 20% of our business is in RMB and about 80% is in dollars. And in terms of the overall business, just maybe one final comment here on China, we can dig into other areas of China if you like. But when we look at the devaluation, we’re not really expecting to have that significant of an impact on the business in China itself. And then it depends also how you view to actually be successful and drive some more growth there. I think the better question is, what could it mean to the economies and currency in some of the emerging markets? But hopefully I answered your question. If not, come back with another one. Yes. That’s helpful. And then just one question on the chemical and energy markets. Could you give us any color around what the order trends are like there and whether you’re seeing any signs of stability I guess in the sort of energy-related end market if at all? Yes. Great question. So we have seen stability, although it’s not where we hope to see coming into this year. So we’re now three quarters in a row of basically flat business in chemical and energy. And I think it\\'s no surprise that the exploration side of that business is down fairly significantly. And we had anticipated that. And just to remind you of an exploration side, our business account for about 15% of this total segment. We are seeing growth in the downstream, chemical and refining process but not to degree that we had hoped to see early this year. So basically we get -- it’s grown enough to offset the downward pressure on the exploration side. Again that segment of the market is very profitable, but they seem to be still cautious on their spending. As you may recall from the analyst meeting we talked to you about our view that this was a 2% to 4% market growth segment and we still see it that way, but we’re just being cautious in our Q4 outlook in this segment right now. We do think it’s stabilizing. We got three quarters in a row of basically flat business in this segment for us. So I guess I want to go back to Dan\\'s question. I mean, it was a pretty solid quarter, but again that book-to-bill of 0.94 was arguably notably light. And the revenue number while solid, it wasn\\'t Herculean feat. So it is helpful to hear the commentary on momentum building over the course of the quarter. That said, even recognizing the commentary in the slight reduction to guidance, the Q4 bar is still pretty high. You did lower guidance, albeit by only about $20 million, excluding FX. You could have chosen to cut more. Is it fair to say that if you saw any change in ordering patterns in the early part of this quarter, in particular those attributable -- now basically those customers that are more exposed to macroeconomic concerns that you probably would have cut guidance more? Yes, Doug. Thanks for the question. And if I may humbly disagree in terms of the comments that revenue actually were quite pleased with being able to put those types of revenue numbers. But I think you’re on the right path. And question here, which is 3% constant currency order growth, what kind of converse do we have going forward? Clearly, if we have seen some of those patterns, I mean we’re having that call here today. We would reflect it in our guidance. And we have reason to be positive about the outlook. If you look at the business by our three groups, our ACG and DGG business have momentum. It’s a recurring revenue business. That business is tracking very nicely. We talked to you about -- I am actually going to ask Patrick to jump in and provide his perspective and as well. I think the obvious question is what’s the outlook for LSAG? And I think we’re one of the few companies out in the space that reports orders. So I think sometimes they get caught in these stories of lumpiness between quarters. When we look at our business here, we respect pharma, biopharma, diagnostics, clinical diagnostics, environment space to remain strong. China is on a steady trajectory, no expected hiccups there. And we just had a number of new product introductions and we’re coming off with tough year, yearly compare and a really strong Q2. So Patrick, I don’t know if you have anything else you would like to add to my comments? Sure, Mike. Thanks. Yes, of course I kind of want to restate that you said here we had. In terms of your order pattern, order for LSAG, we had a slower start based on the very, very strong Q2. We had an also tough compare against last year where several of our big platforms have been 20% plus growth. Having said that, the pattern over Q3 was definitely accelerating through -- positively accelerating through Q3. And as you stated, the outlook for Q4 is positive. We see strong positive momentum in pharma where we have seen strong double-digit growth and we have no belief that momentum will slow down over the next couple of quarters. So given the confidence in our new platforms, which have been very well received, LCMS, and also latest introduction on the ICP-MS front, we are confident that we can deliver more plan for Q4. Okay. Thanks, Mike and Patrick. That’s all real helpful. And one quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this. The $30 million in revenue delayed from Q2 and the Q3 or at least that you talked about on the Q2 call, does that fully come through this quarter or will some of that potentially come through in Q4? Yes. Back in Q2, we talked about the $30 million of being two parts. One part is the $15 million that was a clear miss from the change in the logistic center and we recovered that fully into Q3. The second part is about more of the new normal. What it means is that we have orders coming in later in the quarter and shipment terms being slightly extended versus what we’re used to. And this is really the new normal. So there was no recovery of that second $15 million and we don’t expect it to either to -- I mean, we expect the new normal to be with us for quite sometime. Hey. Thanks. I understand the forward looking commentary here, but I just, think about the quarter on LSAG? Can you actually talk about what drove the 1% decline in core order growth? Where were you most surprise, I guess, relative to your own expectations? Thanks, Tycho. This is Mike. I am going to make a few comments and then, Patrick, I think, the question was the 1% order growth, where were the areas that we might have been surprise on. What I will do is, I will lead off and actually the order results for the quarter matched our own internal forecast. So we\\'re really weren’t surprised, business developed as we had anticipated. And I think, maybe just kind of emphasizing a few comments would be, we saw some deal push-outs on the U.S. and state governments side, saw some continued flat levels of growth in the Chemical and Energy space. But just few other comments you like to add there, Patrick? Sure, Mike. And the biggest surprise certainly for us was in the U.S. as you said, because we have seen the impact of both on the oil and chemistry side and a couple of delayed orders. On the positive side, Europe held up very nicely, as well as China was strong in growth. So in terms of platform to platform that have been affected most by the large delays, for example, LCMS, which had very tough compare compared to last year, where we had as we said plus 20% growth… And then, on DGG, 8% core growth is kind of at the high-end where you’ve talked about for market growth? Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of trends and whether there is a little bit of catch up effect here now around the  . Yeah. You are right, I mean, if you look into, I mean, that’s why we have seen a very nice quarter here also with great growth and now see orders coming in at 8%. I do believe that we are on a good traction right now. We are continued to see great performance from the DGG. But you\\'re also right that it did little bit above what I’ve guided in our Analyst Day and clearly, we are also moving through a few quarters here, where we last year had some back order issues in the pathology business there, somewhat is an easy compare, but underlying the momentum is definitely here. Good. On the DGG Group, are the CMS guidelines that were released late in the year, so you where, I guess, implying is it, are those new guidelines helping DGG business and is it kind of more momentum from that occurring right now within that group? Oh! I am sorry, on the center for Medicare or Medicaid services. They put out the new rules in October last year? Yeah. Thanks for that question. Actually, those rules are not really covering the -- our particularly business -- the pathology business and that sits outside the pathology business, so we don’t -- we didn\\'t see any change to that and overall the pathology market continues to be healthy. So we have not been impacted by those changes in guidelines and I don\\'t expect that we will see any changes in our performance due to those guidelines going forward either. Yes. I mean, we are -- we definitely continue to see that the on this momentum installation is improving. As I have also mentioned earlier, there is sales cycle that are more than few months or maybe even few quarters. So we are still building momentum, but we continue seeing and also an improvement in taking back market share and win competitive accounts. So I am pretty optimistic around that the future also in pathology business. And then lastly, Mike, on the NMR closure, are you now in the peak of cost savings there or is it part of the reason you\\'re seeing improving margins going forward? Yeah. We are well above our run rate of cost savings, I would say, we say that initially we were actually for $50 million per year now it’s a $20 million and we are getting to pretty much our run rate there. The one thing I will signal is that, we are -- next year we still we will have about $11 million of revenue that will show on the RPD front and for the first three quarters as we make the last installations and then recognize revenue, so that will be about $50 million reduction from this year and but we will continue showing our orders and revenue on a core basis, excluding NMR so that we are comparing apple-to-apple. Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just want to circle back to an earlier topic in the Q&A, specifically regarding the impact of new products this year in the business? Could you maybe offer like a full-year expectation for contribution from new products to topline? How if I pass it over to Patrick and talk about some of the new offerings in the instruments side and Jacob and Mark you comment on your groups and then I will close with answer to your question, Isaac. Definitely last few years, so this is Patrick speaking. So when you look at our new product offering this year and there is a series new products we launched, let me start with the LC business where the, actually, end of last year, startup of the Infinity II LC launch and we added this year actually at the HPLC Meeting another set of products to it that is driving definitely a lot of market share gains for us so far this year. In Q3 we had growth in orders and in revenues. We had double-digit growth on this platform driven by strong acceptance in many markets, mainly in the pharmaceutical markets where we see larger enterprises, as well as more companies making replacement and buy some new instruments, because this has -- platform has such a strong offering. Then on LC/MS we just launched the new 6470 Triple Quad system which will overtime replace our very solid performing 6460 Quad platform, again very strong interest after ASMS introduction and there is more to come during the year. So the contribution for product we don’t disclose the actual percentage, but it drives a lot of new business for us and a lot of attention in the market. Yes. Yeah. I will just give you an example from the spectroscopy, thanks Mike. So we launched the ICP-MS solution 7800 and on the OES side as we introduced a year ago the IC -- 5100 ICP-OES system that just an example of how we kept about 7 points in market share over 15 months based on this highly differentiated platform. So it’s really one of the means for us to capture market share and drive growth. It will make significant contribution. I think, Mark, I made a few comments in the call script about some of the recent offerings, but maybe just a few highlights for Isaac on the ACG side. On the ACG side, as Mike alluded to you in his earlier comments, obviously, it’s a key driver of our ongoing growth too. So specifically for this quarter on the enterprise side a trio of services that are largely around our asset management area and also include in the advanced bio area. So it’s hard to put an exact percentage on it, but obviously, we are putting a lot of effort behind growing what we see the differentiated side of our portfolio in consumables and services and putting R&D and marketing budgets behind that. I would also add based on the Patrick\\'s comments, when you introduce new platform it is also a great opportunity to introduce new services and consumables around that and to that end we, obviously, have chance to augment introduction whether it’s consulting services or consumables that put a whole platform. So when you tie all together there is some nice synergies between what goes on from the LSAG side, the DGG side, and obviously, our ACG team. All right. Thanks and thanks Isaac for asking the question, I am -- as you can hear, we can definitely talk long time about all the new exciting products. But I will just remind you that that we have a few different dynamics going on in my business. First of all, with the pathology and diagnostics businesses and we are in partnership. This is not about bring out new product everyday, but they have -- you want to install your new instrument into the account and then get the contract and then run the rate and the new products we actually bring out there is new assay that goes on top of that. So you, of course, have a different lifecycle of the products that we have in chemical market compared to maybe in the genomics research market where we come up with some existing products also, the HaloPlex HS which actually address very low concentration of sequencing information, the  exome improvement also and Gene Expression arrays. Those have shorter lifetime and we see a higher percentage of our sales from this year and into next year from those products. And why they made us put a bow on this discussion, but we talk a lot about the portfolio, but I would be remiss that to remind you of the channel change you made this year. So, we’re also -- we simplified our cell structure and it’s going to allow us to invest in buildout coverage. So I think you’re going to see our growth being fueled going forward not only on the strength of the new portfolio but also the expanded channel reach and specialization, we’ve been investing in. And this is a note through the first three quarters. I think our quarter revenues were over 6% and we’re on track for our strongest revenue growth in several years. I think probably a point greater than any other growth rates we’ve put up in the last three years. But again if I could just leave that with you on the combination of both the new product offerings but also our change in channel strategy as well. All right. Hey guys, I really appreciate all the detail. I don’t want to sound too ungrateful but on that 6% number year-to-date, how much of it was on those new products? We don\\'t know. We don’t -- we don\\'t have that number that we\\'ve shared externally but it’s been a contributor. All I can say is significant contributor. I think everyone is obviously trying to get a handle on what’s going on in the economy there. It seems to me maybe a simple way to break it up will be to delineate the percentage of your business in China that is maybe funded by sort of federal and in government sort of associated entities versus products that might be tied more to discretionary CapEx. Do you have a way to maybe break it down between those two buckets within, just sort of, I think, within China 17% of sales, maybe between those two end markets, how would you split it? No. Not at the company level, I mean, information, it’s probably tracked by some of our people. But I’m not collecting it and aggregating it. What I can share with you is because we’ve been kind of nosing around on this question ourselves internally. And the areas of strength particularly the Pharma area is a lot of private sector money. So traditionally this market has been heavily dominated by the direct investment by the government. We’re seeing a move. I think it’s still the majority but we are seeing a lot more business coming from private funded enterprises, particularly as the Chinese government also is moving a lot of its testing outside of government testing labs, for example, the food area where there\\'s now whole new set of private testing labs that are -- they are coming online in the country. Yeah. The other complexity we are even trying to attract that is for the companies that fewer Chinese companies that in their exporters versus the local -- I mean companies that can go after the local market, the exporters will benefit from the weakening yen. So it’s going to be that several layers of complexity, would we want to try to focus the overall impact of the weakening of the yen or the weakening of the Chinese GDP. Mike just -- hi Mike. Just following up on the China discussion, what\\'s your take at this point on where we are with the anti-corruption investigations? Is it your sense that we kind of fully turned the corner there or is it still little early to signal all clear on that? Yeah, Dan. Great question. I think it\\'s a new normal. I think this is -- the effort is here to stay. I think in terms of the changes where we talked about before of slowing deal velocity and a lot more conservatism in terms of the overall approval process. I think that sort of baked out now. So we’re no longer pointing to longer deal cycles in China as a result of anti-corruption. But I think the longer deal cycles are here to stay and now are now in this kind of this rhythm of really cautious approvals by the government authorities. And that\\'s why I mentioned earlier that a lot of the areas of growth particularly in the private sector where you’ve not seen the same bureaucratic approach to approvals of deals. I think this is the new normal. Got it. Okay. That\\'s helpful. And then maybe just on LSAG, can you maybe comment on pricing in chromatography as we just sort of thinking about the new product introductions and then just the strong overall results across the space. Curious maybe to just get an updated view on how ASPs are trending relative to ….? Happy to take this one. So as you can imagine, every new product introduction gives the opportunity to also improve your gross margins and ASPs which we actually have seen. And there is actually for us, that’s one of the reasons why we’re also confident on delivering to the bottomline over the year. So we will continue to launch these new products because they are highly differentiated and give you an opportunity to drive ASP and we will keep ASP up which otherwise would erode overtime. I think it is fair to say Patrick particular to -- specific to the Japan business, it’s not a new phenomenon. But our competitors there who don’t have the same currency challenges that we do are using that to be very aggressive at times on pricing but we have the gross margin structure to be able to compete. Good afternoon guys. So Mike, obviously as you sort of embarked to CEO of the new Agilent, you put forth a lot of programs to sustain sort of the superior growth and improve the margin and the cash flow generation. If you think about the various things highlighted in the call, where do you feel like you sort of outperformed kind of timing expectations and you’ve seen maybe similarly signs of the benefits in the organization and where do you feel like you need to make the most progress? Thanks Ross. Appreciate the recognition of the kind comments. I think the area that I’m mostly done is the ability to get the margin improvements. I mean, we’re basically six months into the journey since I transitioned to the role from Bill. And I can see the momentum and our ability to get our margin structure to different place. I think you’ve heard reference in the number of times in our call today. And if you were inside the company, I think everybody knows the goal that we’re trying -- we\\'re shooting for. So I think that’s the area that I’m really -- obviously the growth, pleased with their ability to grow. And we always want more growth but we’re looking for -- we\\'re on pace to have our highest growth year since 2011. So -- and then I think there\\'s been a solid reaction to how we modified our approach to couple of deployment as well. Great. And again there seems to be just a little confusion sort of the order versus revenue pacing. Last quarter, obviously at the short fall, you build the backlog. It looked like $30 million you called out looked about right versus the last few years. In this quarter, it looked like you flushed around $60 million of backlog based on the differential versus orders. And then as we think about and again I realized most players in the industry don’t give a book to bill. It seems like your commentary is suggestive of your orders around track, which I guess would more imply we did see that backlog flush this quarter. And so I’m just trying to reconcile that versus Didier’s comment because I thought implied we didn’t get full all of the 30 back in some. I’m trying to reconcile the delta between what the backlog is showing and kind of what you actually saw in the business because in my mind you did about 1.01 book to bill over the two quarters. And again this is the CapEx business. So looking over a longer period is usually better. Yeah. Thanks for that clarifying question, Ross. I think what Didier was trying to point out, I think we talked about $15 million of business coming in. We couldn’t ship it to the Q3. So obviously that came through this quarter. But the view is we’ve probably got another 15 in which we’ll ship and which we didn’t ship this quarter. Did that answer the question, Ross? Yeah. But I guess, on the order rate side, the other point, it seems like that\\'s more of a function of timing and revenue recognition, any sort of underlying change in the tone of the business? No. I understand your question now, so -- and again, I think we saw a good quarter momentum through the quarter. And you’ll see some new movements between quarters lot of times which we saw between Q2, Q3 and Q4. But the overall …. I guess, when you look at your business, I think year-to-date, you guys are probably the fastest-growing life science company at least that we look at in terms of traditional analytical equipment. As you try to figure out in -- it\\'s tough comparing different companies, given different product and geographic exposure but where do you feel like you\\'re doing the best and is it really maybe -- how much of it sort of leveraged to biopharma which seems to be healthiest end market, which you guys have obviously done well in versus may be technology share or other elements, some of the other sub-sectors. We’re just -- it is just of perception here that maybe you guys are growing on average to me, I’m curious if it is to you. Looks like you’re actually probably the fastest growing. So, I’m just trying to bridge that gap. Our internal map would match your numbers or your view. Obviously, pharma, biopharma has been a key part of the growth story but it’s not the only part of the growth story. And I think it speaks to the breadth of our portfolio and businesses we are in so. As you know from -- you may recall from the analyst meeting, we talked at great length about our view of CrossLab services, consumable, informatics, how that was going to be an area of future growth outside of just the technology areas. And then you heard the DGG story already from Jacob and that’s a business that will continue to get momentum as we continue to put more and more of the   out there. You start to close deals on the slides and then that starts to show up in revenue in the coming quarters. And then we haven’t talked about it today but Companion Diagnostics, we’ve been winning some deals there. So, I think it’s not only a story of end market strength in certain segments like pharma but also where we are playing in our view of lab-wide services and the momentum we have in our DDG business. And then finally, I think from a technology platform, it is very clear we are doing quite well in spectroscopy in the liquid phase and spectrometry areas. Quick question here. Just about the revenue guidance reductions, heard just about that. Just trying to understand, Didier, if I heard you correctly, of the $37 million reduction in the sales line, $15 million is FX. What is the remainder of the reduction, where is it coming from? The $22 million remainder is basically a reassessment of our view on the chemical and energy markets where we are seeing now that the downstream refining and chemical markets are not picking up as fast as we expected the benefits of the low cheaper feedstock. So probably considering the fact that there is some little bit of stickiness about the world economy, we are not seeing the pickup in those downstream markets that will offset the drop in our revenues in the exploration production. So, we were hoping for again a pickup there and it’s not happening. And our business overall is about flat. Okay. Excellent. And separately, let me ask you, the $15 million of revenue, the help that you had from the revolution of your logistics center issues, was there any impact on margin on the operating margin expansion there? Great question. So, Didier, correct me if I’ve got my math wrong here. But in terms of the topline, we got everything through. The shipments are back to normal. The customers experience is just fine. But we have seen cost overruns relative to our expectations as we work through the operational issues and I think it\\'s probably been to the tune of about $0.01 on Q3 on reported EPS. But besides that from the $15 million, it’s about kind of average, vouching for that piece although there is probably a little bit more of consumable for the little bit better operating margin at the average. But still that in itself, we had the operating leverage not much else. And then, this point that Mike was making that as we worked addressing the issues that we were facing logistics centers, we incurred close to $0.01 of additional cost in Q3. Yes. I just want to ask about some of commentary in the deck about the U.S. and state government deals getting pushed into 4Q. I was curios if you could give a little bit more commentary around that. And then just whether you thought any of the momentum in the academic and the market around and Congress around some improved funding, maybe that with impacting out there? I can take this one, yes. Thanks Mike. So what we have seen in the first half, you’ve heard all the comments, we actually had a pretty healthy business in this market segment. In Q3, we saw kind of a pause where we have seen several of our larger accounts, actually took a pause and reassessed the budget for the remainder of the year and just delayed several deals. So, we don’t see these deals lost and we really anticipate that we will see in academic, government section, especially in U.S. that picking up again in Q4 this year. Got it. Understood. And then, just one question on the gross margins in the CrossLab business. Just curious if you had any thoughts around the pricing dynamic there just given that the consumable piece of the business was doing quite well, I thought we might see a little bit more pull through on the gross margin line? Sure. And Jack, in terms of the year-to-year comparable, once again it’s apples to oranges on the CrossLab business. And next year, you will be in a great position to ask me because it will be an apples-to-apples compare between the two. But the vast majority of the synergies are the spin and we did invest money to obviously take care of some logistics issues. So as Mike talked about some of the impacted earnings per share, a lot of that came through on our business. So overall though, I don\\'t think we\\'ve seen near but frankly, we haven’t seen that much pressure on the ASPs at this point in time. Mike, I don’t know if you want to add any comments? Yeah. I think the ASPs, a really solid year and mainly and if you look at our prior year comparisons, it really been a story of the synergies and market picking up the load of the logistics center, cost overruns. And as you saw in our cost script, we are really investing heavily to bring out new chemistry products, which have some very nice margin structure associated with them. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I\\'ll start with one, a bit of a retrospective for Mike. It has to do with sales force strategy. Mike, your several number months now into this area where you have consolidated sales forces. When you make a decision to consolidate the sales force, introduces a number of different possibilities. One is that you can be more nimble going after opportunities. Number two is of course, there can be disruptions. Can you reflect on that process, what you\\'ve seen and to the extent if you can, can you share any progress on metrics around that process? Yeah. Great, great question. And in terms of the sales force changes as you pointed out, that was one of the first major changes we’ve made in the new Agilent. And I really think it\\'s allowed us to streamline our executive structure and we had a lot of well meaning managers but we spend a lot of time discussing things internally. And this allow us to actually move a lot faster as we really entered two business, the analytical lab marketplace across a number of end markets and then in the regulated diagnostics space in Jacob\\'s business. I\\'m very, very pleased with how the overall plan has gone. We have been very -- in terms of how we look at internally, we are ahead of our cost reduction goals. I think more importantly, we\\'re getting the growth and we\\'re getting the coverage. They want it to be able to invest to cover, make sure we can cover all the markets and invest in specialization where we needed. Now this is a multiyear program. So, I think this really I would say is the foundation year. And I think as you go into FY ‘16 and ’17, you start to get the full benefit of our ability to have really close account relationships backed up by very, very competent sales personnel. Thanks Mike. And then one for Jacob. I’m not sure if you gave it earlier but if you didn’t, would you mind giving us a growth rate for the Dako business? And it would be really helpful if you could comment on where you think we are in terms of the process of Dako, what inning if you will sort of using American sports analogy? Are we in with Dako in terms of getting back to full scale and our ability to grow the business quickly? And then sorry to keep piling on here. But if you wouldn\\'t mind, it sounds like just based on your tone and comments really that that business really is picking up. If you wouldn\\'t give us a bit of insight into the nuts and bolts of where it is you\\'re seeing the business pickup, is it equipment refreshes in the replacement cycle, is it more about competitor share gains, is it more about the instrumentation and the consumables that get run through the instruments? Any color there would be really helpful. Thanks again. All right, Steve. So, I will give you a little bit color without getting all the information about our underlying businesses here. But overall, the Dako businesses consist of few businesses. Two prime parts we have talked about is the pathology business and then our Companion Diagnostic business where the companion diagnostic is our partnering business with the pharma companies on developing new Companion Diagnostic within IHC and the FISH-based. And by the way, this is going very, very well and we will soon see the first significant launch of new Companion Diagnostic within a PLD-1 drug space. However, your questions around the pathology business and how we see that, I mean overall, we definitely see a good momentum. I will not say we are completely back in full scale yet. We did see some challenges last year on some back orders. We also have improved our performance on the Omnis over the last quarters, so we see actually all cylinders kick now. But it actually takes a few quarters to win deals in this space here. So, I would actually see continuous improvement over next few quarters. What we do see is that when we win deals, we of course win back. We win the deals that we -- in refresh of technology but we definitely also see a pickup in competitive deals as the Omnis solution is very competitive. And when you do that, when you put a new placement in, you will also get all the ranges running through that platform. So you place an instrument and then it takes another, maybe another quarter to get full loading of your consumables in there. So, I expect actually that we are in a good trajectory here. But the best remains to be seen also. Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So can we just kind of clarify some of the commentary that’s been given so far on the organic growth expectations? Given from what you’ve said on the past, the previous questions, it seems like the weaker book-to-bill in the third quarter could have been, due to some of the weakness in the energy and chemical markets and that kind of flows through into the fourth quarter, or is it a function of something else? I guess when it comes down to, it doesn’t make -- it isn\\'t completely apparent in terms of how the delayed orders would necessarily adversely affect the book-to-bill, but then there would be an ultimate catch-up to that? So, I guess, could you just kind of help us walk through, are the expectations purely oil and gas or is there something else in there that we need to think about for the fourth quarter specifically? Sure. Dane, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some of the earlier comments. I think the relative to what we reporting to in our U.S. government side of the business, that a situation where normally we face on last year’s deal activity, we had Q3 business last year and what we saw was, as Patrick mentioned, that business is going to go from Q3 to Q4. So that’s one of the reasons why you had a drop in the book-to-bill. I think as we mentioned earlier too, we started off slow in the third quarter coming off a very strong close to Q2. We start off flow in May. We saw the pace of orders we just didn’t chance to close all the business in the third quarter. I really wouldn’t point to the chemical and energy beyond the fact that its just a continuation of what we have been seeing, which is basically no growth, three quarters in a row and I’m not going to call a recovery like I done earlier this year. So we’re just remained cautious on the implied industrial market both, the chemical and energy, as well as mining sector of our business. And then, if you -- one more question on China, I know you guys have answered a lot of them color. Generally, at the end of these five-year plans there is somewhat of a spending flush. Is that -- it doesn\\'t seem like many people contemplated that. Is that something guys have thought about or given the state of things over there? It would be too aggressive to hope for something to occur like that? Yeah. I think great question again. We’ve taken a fairly conservative view on that, if it happens great, but we’re not counting on that, because there is lot of changes recently under the new leadership in terms of how they conduct their business. So, again, if it would happen, wonderful news for the industry, but we\\'re not counting on them in our go-forward forecast. Okay. Great. And one last one for me on the gross margin line, the current guidance does seem like we get above that 54% in the fourth quarter? Is that something that you guys feel confident, we’ll see given where the FX rates and the composition of the product mix that we would expect there or should we kind of alter expectations where the operating margin uptick comes from? Yeah. We don’t usually provide guidance on the gross margin level. But yes, we\\'re expecting a slight improvement in gross margin sequentially between Q3 and Q4. That’s typically where we that kind of pattern we see historically as particularly in the services side as we finish out the year. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. Sorry about that. I was on mute. Couple of question. So is your fourth quarter guidance dependent upon any large changed orders in the government? Great. So I think there is some concern the commodity prices need to fall, there is some concern the commodity prices may continue to fall. So if you do have -- if we given it like 5% to 10% decline in current level commodity price, how does that impact  I think we’ve been carrying this free fall of commodity prices for some time. So our view is that if we continue to see downward pressure, I think it would push out your return to growth in this segment but the business is pretty subdued there already. Patrick, I don’t know if you have anything, you’d add to that. Yeah. I mean what we discussed beginning of this year was that we actually could see some upside, which flow of feedstock prices, which didn’t kick in so far but which would be a fundamental underlying economical drive if the feedstock price could go further down. So I would say we are on the exploration side. We’re definitely not further exposed than we are already today. Yeah. On one hand we’re losing, on the other hand we saw economies with larger importers of commodities whether its oil or others, it’s a big plus, China, India, Japan so. Great. And just one final question, can you sort of remind us on your manufacturing footprint what you do in China versus Malaysia? And I guess the question -- on the basis of that question, I think there is some concerns that there could be some currency devaluation on some of the other countries and I think people were -- I\\'m getting some questions from investors about company exposure. Yeah. Great question. So if you look at what we call strategic manufacturing side, so we’re fairly diversified globally but we have two major sites in Asia. One is in China for our gas chromatography, which is a major product line for us. And then in Penang, Malaysia, we have all of our spectroscopy atomic and molecular spectroscopy, as well as some of our vacuum products and some of the DGG products. So they are two major sites for us. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Okay. I think our European outside of the currency offset, I mean the business there has been a really nice story for us this year and I point to Patrick. But I think we\\'re seeing no real significant changes there. The one part of the European business that we’re keeping a close eye on is really some of the emerging economies in Africa and the Middle East, how that could play out, but Western Europe has been pretty good for us. It has been very good. In terms of end markets, pharma has been definitely very strong story. We have seen flat to healthy business in the range of life science research overall. There is actually some upside potential there with we noticed to spending of the   that should also materialize in research over time. So for us the European market although has held up very nicely and we have been positively surprised over several quarters now by the local currency growth we have seen in Europe. And it hasn’t been just a story on the instrumentation side, we’ve really -- the customers really have responded to this CrossLab promise that the Mark’s team has put together. There is a lot of big wins on the service side in particular and then you heard already what’s been going on in the Dako and DDG business. All right. Thank you. And one more question from me. I guess probably for Mike, how do you feel about the overall visibility in the business? You may be ignoring backlog metrics specifically and how has that changed over the past 6 to 12 months? All right. Great. You broke up a bit. I think what we\\'ve seen is the visibility is pretty good out a quarter or so and this is a reminder. We book orders. We don’t book any orders unless they can be delivered in six months. So I think our visibility of a three to six kind of months\\' timeframe is pretty solid because we got the funnel. And course we have deal funnels that we track that have longer deal cycles. So we have a pretty confident view three to six months out and a kind of a longer-term view beyond that through our sales funnel metrics. I would say though that and this is the point that Didier made earlier that we are seeing more and more of the business come late in the quarter. And rather than hoping for a change in historical and to this pattern, we now made this our new normal in terms of how we think and plan for business on the revenue side. Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, Abigail. And thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us call on IR. And on behalf of all the management team, I’d like to wish you a good day. Thanks.

Before turning the call over to Mike, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its annual analyst and investor meeting in New York City on May 28. Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent investor website. Thanks, Alicia. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q2 call, my first as CEO of the new Agilent. I will start with a summary of our Q2 operating financial performance. Next, I will cover our progress on operating margin expansion and stock repurchases. Finally, I will close an update on our current guidance. I\\'m pleased to report that Agilent delivered solid earnings within guidance. I\\'m even more pleased to share the story of our top line order growth. This growth is being driven by a continued strong market acceptance of our new offerings and the effectiveness of our new sales structure. Let me start with four major operational highlights. First, our Agile Agilent program launched last quarter. This program is successfully removing costs from the business and allowing us to aggressively build a more nimble and streamlined company. Second, we addressed manufacturing-driven backlog issues in our nucleic acid businesses. As a result, we have returned DGG to double-digit profitability. A third operational highlight is some very good news. After a lot of hard work and significant investment, our FDA warning letter was lifted six months earlier than expected. Finally, we strengthened Agilent\\'s portfolio by divesting our XRD business. Now let me review Agilent\\'s financials for the second fiscal quarter. Our Q2 revenue was down 3% and grew 4% on a core or currency-adjusted basis to $963 million. Reported orders grew 1% and were up 8% on a core basis to $1.04 billion. Excluding the divested businesses of NMR and XRD, core revenue growth was 5% and core order growth was 10%. Book-to-bill increased 1.08, as we were unable to convert all this order strength into revenue within the quarter. Let me provide some additional detail. First, we had a lot of orders come in later in the quarter. Second, shipping challenges at our new Americas logistics center delayed some customer shipments until Q3. The shipping issue was a start-up issue and is being addressed; however, the order timing and shipping challenges accounted for approximately $30 million of revenue that was pushed from Q2 to Q3. The strengthening dollar also had an impact, reducing reported revenue by $6 million versus our guidance. Despite the revenue recognition delay, we are quite pleased with our bottom line performance. Operating margin, adjusted for Keysight billings, was 18.3%, up 140 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.38 with both the operating margin and EPS results matching guidance. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences Applied Markets Group, or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent\\'s analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth was 1%, or 2% excluding NMR. Growth was led by LC, microfluidics, mass spec, ICP-OES, and software. Orders were strong across the group, up 6% on a core basis and up 10% excluding NMR. As an aside, the previously communicated exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.8%. We saw excellent growth in LC systems in the second quarter. The new 1290 Infinity II system, which we launched in Q4, continues to be well received by the market. This system sets new benchmarks in analytical efficiency, quality, ease of use, and integration. We expect the 1290 Infinity II product portfolio to deliver double-digit growth through fiscal year 2015. We ship the new 6545 LCMS Q-TOF with a formal launch scheduled for the ASMS Conference at the beginning of June. The 6545 addresses a core Q-TOF market with better performance, increased uptime and robustness, and improved ease of use for small molecule applications. We released OpenLAB ELN 5.0. The new electronic lab notebook adds several core feature enhancements, including an iPad mobile client. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business under a new Agilent brand. ACG delivered outstanding results. Core revenues were up 7%, while core orders grew 12% in the quarter. Operating margin was 21.5%. In consumables, we expanded the Poroshell 120 family to include a new 4-micron particle size. Sales of this family have exceeded expectations and are contributing to continued growth in the Poroshell family. We released the AdvanceBIO sample prep kit, which adds to our separation and manual sample prep technologies. Our recently introduced A-Line supply portfolio is ramping well above expectations. And customers have responded very favorably to our new FRID   inventory management service solution. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, or DGG, is comprised of three divisions: the former Dako business, genomics, and nucleic acid solutions. DGG recovered nicely in Q2, as previously guided, delivering strong core revenue growth of 10% versus a year ago. Dako and the nucleic acid businesses led DGG\\'s results. Orders grew 5% on a core basis. DGG returned to double-digit operating margins, delivering 15% in Q2. In April, we announced that the U.S. FDA lifted its warning letter on Agilent\\'s Dako, Denmark subsidiary earlier than expected. We\\'re on track for the remaining remediation efforts to be completed by Q3. And our companion diagnostics engagement with Merck continues to make progress. In April, Merck submitted a biologics license application to the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer. Omnis Instruments continued to gain customer traction, setting a new quarterly record for instrument placements. And SureFISH again saw strong growth, driven by sales through the pathology channel. This is just one example of the synergy that we\\'re able to leverage across the new Agilent. Our expertise and experience in analytical labs continues to drive further penetration into adjacent clinical and diagnostics laboratories. We expect these types of synergies to be characteristic of the new Agilent. In keeping with our strategy of executing bolt-on acquisitions of complementary growth businesses, earlier this month, we announced our acquisition of Cartagenia for €60 million. Cartagenia is a leading provider of software and services for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. Now, let\\'s take a brief look at Agilent\\'s end-market performance on a core basis. Pharmaceutical revenue grew strongly with broad-based results across customers and products. We also saw excellent demand in clinical and diagnostics, with revenue growing solidly during the quarter. Growth in food and environmental revenue was more modest, led by demand from China. Academia and government revenue decreased slightly due to some delayed budgets and order backlog build. Chemical energy saw a similar decrease from lower oil prices, as expected. The decline in oil production and exploration was partially offset by refining and chemical demand. Geographically, we saw excellent core revenue growth in the Americas, with moderate growth in Europe and Asia excluding China and Japan. Greater China orders were strong, though not yet reflected in revenue. Similarly, Japan core revenue declined but saw single-digit core growth in orders. As you know, we completed the CEO transition at the March 18th shareholder meeting, and our new leadership team is fully in place. During our Q1 call, I highlighted three focus areas where we\\'re working as a team to drive shareholder value. As a reminder, they are: accelerate organic growth, expand operating margin, deploy capital for long-term shareholder value. Turning from the report out of the momentum in our core growth, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q2 capital deployment actions. We are executing our multi-year Agile Agilent program, reengineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. Our previously announced restructuring is underway. The new sales channel and divisional structure are fully implemented. We continue to look for opportunities to streamline and rethink our legacy business models. The recent closing of our U.S. Government Affairs office is just one example. We have already delivered $24 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We remain committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY 2017. As previously guided, this year we\\'re on track to return $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. In Q2, we repurchased $162 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $168 million. In our Q1 call, we raised our core growth guidance and commit to offset $0.05 of negative FX impact through cost controls and other actions. We are confirming this full year EPS guidance. Didier will provide further details in his remarks. As the new CEO, it gives me great pleasure to announce that Forbes has identified Agilent as one of America\\'s best employers in its first-ever ranking. We\\'re rated as a top employer in the healthcare equipment and services industry category. Part of my mission would make us even better. We look forward to seeing you at our May 28th analyst meeting in New York. We\\'ll take that opportunity to discuss Agilent\\'s businesses in more detail. I look forward to sharing more about the steps we are taking to reach the goals we have set to drive long-term shareholder value through accelerated growth, operating margin expansion, and optimal capital allocation. Thank you for joining our call today, and I\\'ll now turn it over to Didier, who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\\'s financial results and guidance. Didier? Thank you, Mike, and hello everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of closed and divested businesses, were respectively 10% and 5%. As Mike stated, about $30 million of revenues was carried over into Q3 due to late incoming orders and some startup issues with the transfer of our U.S. distribution center. Those issues have now been stabilized and they will be fixed this quarter. Although revenues ended up $32 million under the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, 10 basis points higher than guidance, and 140 basis points higher than last year on 2.5% lower nominal revenues. This quarter, currency subtracted about 6.8 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. Finally, we bought back $162 million of stock in Q2 and generated $183 million in operating cash flow. I\\'ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $995 million to $1.015 billion and EPS of $0.38 to $0.42. At midpoint, revenue will grow 7% on a core basis. Our 18.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be equal to this quarter\\'s operating margin. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program and reach the planned $365 million of repurchases by year-end. Now to the guidance for the fiscal year. Versus our previous guidance, currency is forecasted to have a $10 million negative impact on revenue. We are adjusting our revenue guidance for that impact, but we are not modifying our EPS guidance. We expect fiscal year 2015 revenues to range from $4.05 billion to $4.11 billion and fiscal year 2015 EPS to range from $1.67 to $1.73. Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. My first question is really on the guidance. So you slightly reduced full-year revenue growth expectations, but not by much. I believe your second half core growth would have to exceed about 7% to get to your full year guidance. When you combine these observations with the observation that you talked about strong backlog heading into the third quarter, but then you guided revenue expectations a bit below where consensus stood, it does seem like second half growth is not only expected to accelerate but also to be a bit more back-end loaded than most of us were expecting. Could you just talk about what gives you confidence in the implied Q4 growth acceleration expectations that you seemingly built into guidance? Yeah, Doug, this is Mike. Thanks for the great question. And let me offer some additional commentary on our thinking about the confidence we have in the top line momentum and also our thinking about how we guided for the second half. When we look – obviously, very pleased with the top line momentum that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And if you look at it, we\\'ve had two strong top line order quarters for the company. And what we\\'re seeing is strong market, end-market strength in pharma, clinical and diagnostics, a strong U.S. and recovering China market. And we believe we\\'re very well-positioned, which is reflected in the order numbers, to capture this growth with the strength with not only our portfolio but also our new sales structure. As I did mention in my remarks, though, we did have some startup issues with the logistics center. And also, we saw a late time in orders coming in the quarter. So we\\'re becoming increasingly mindful of what seemed to be a change of customer buying behavior as we look at our revenue projections for the third quarter. But with the backlog, the ongoing strength of the top line, we remain quite confident in our ability to deliver on the top line growth forecast. Didier, anything else that you would add? No, just to quantify. I mean, the $30 million that moved into Q3 is equivalent to 3 percentage points of revenue, if you would adjust the first half of that 3 percentage points, that really moved into the second half, then the growth between the first half to the second half is a lot more reasonable. Yeah, and Doug, it may also help you to hear directly from each of the group presidents how they look at their respective business just to give you a better feel for how we\\'re thinking about the business in the second half. And Mark, perhaps I can start with you? Thanks, Mike. And obviously this is another quarter where we\\'ve produced double-digit core order growth. So from the standpoint of the response we\\'ve got in the marketplace around our innovative products and services has been quite good. And I think it\\'s a validation of our CrossLab strategy and the value we have for the customers. And looking forward, the fundamentals, as you suggest, really don\\'t change much as we look at the end market strength in Americas and in China and some other places around the globe. And we continue to have strong demand from Europe. So long story short, it\\'s a continuation we see of the strong fundamentals we have right now. Yeah, thanks Mike. So for LSAG, we have seen continued strong performance in our core product lines like LCMS, ICP-OES throughout Q1 and Q2. There\\'s a lot of very strong momentum behind these new products that we recently introduced. And solutions like the Infinity II LCs that you mentioned or the ICP-OES and our high-end LCMS solutions. So for the second quarter, as you stated before, we had order growth on a core base of 10% excluding RPD. I think we have a very strong pipeline. We see a strong funnel, and therefore also are committed to the second half. Yes, certainly. As you have noticed, DGG had a strong Q2, definitely compensating for the challenges in Q1. And we see the improved momentum in all our divisions. Soon being out of the FDA activities and back to normal operationally, I do expect to see the pathology business continue to strengthen throughout the rest of the year together with the rest of the portfolio. So I also have very strong confidence in the second half year. Great. That\\'s really helpful, and given all the detail I will step away, get back in the queue, and let some other folks ask some questions. Thanks again. Hi, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just I guess another question in terms of the back half expectations. Clearly, the trend for the operating margin has been a bit down with some of the dissynergies coming from the spinout. But as we think about coming into the end of the year, can you help us with the pacing? I mean, it seems like the implied guidance would still have us down marginally in the back half of the year, but quite a substantial improvement versus the first half. So any thinking you can help us with on the operating expenses as they move into the back half of the year I think would be appreciated. Yeah, Dane, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. I\\'ll make some initial comments and then pass it over to Didier. So as you saw in my prepared remarks, we were quite pleased with the operating margin performance for the business, particularly in that revenue came in below our initial expectations, albeit we\\'ll pick it up in the second half. And you also saw that I went to some length to describe the costs that have been coming out of the structure already, and we\\'re about halfway through the $50 million commitment already. So I think as the final tail-off of our restructuring starts to hit and some of the other costs and some of our other aspects of our Agile Agilent program start to hit, you\\'ll see us continue to bring down the operating expenses in the coming quarters. And, Didier, I don\\'t know if you want to add to that? Yeah, I\\'ll just, and you know, as you have been able to calculate, I mean our guiding midpoint for an operating margin in Q3 of 18.3%, which is at the same level as we\\'ve had in Q2 with slightly lower gross margin. Q2 had some very favorable currency hedging gains and slightly higher OpEx, mostly because of currency and some slight increase in stock-based compensation. And then for Q4, the implied operating margin for the Q4 to get to the 19% for the whole year, which we are guiding to, would be 20.9%, which would be slightly higher than what we achieved last year of 20.4%, which means that we will see then the full impact of the Agile Agilent program as with an increase in operating margin, even though we are facing still the $40 million dissynergies that we\\'ve talked about at length. Okay. So yeah, I guess the overarching theme that Doug kicked off with was a pretty strong fourth quarter. Maybe you could just kind of elaborate on the comps that you have from the fourth quarter last year. Was there something particularly weak in terms of how the business is constituted last year that maybe you\\'d hit better overhead absorption, et cetera, in the fourth quarter this year along with some strong organic growth comps? I guess that\\'s probably what we\\'re kind of grasping at here is, where the confidence for the fourth quarter specifically is coming from. I think it\\'s twofold, right? One is we do have some level of easy compares, I would say that, particularly as Jacob mentioned in his earlier comments, we now see our DGG business back on track, but we were seeing a retraction in terms of our growth at this time last year. So I think there is an element of, if you will, easier compares in Q4. I think Q4 historically is always our strongest quarter, and we\\'ve got this very strong order momentum and backlog going into the back half. And I would say we\\'re trying to guide fairly conservatively for Q3 on the revenue as well. Yeah so, certainly to emphasize what Mike has said, last Q4 was 1 percentage point lower core revenue growth than the average of the year. So it was kind of, I would say, a weaker quarter in terms of revenue growth that we saw throughout the year. And then as I mentioned, we are guiding for an operating margin of 20.9, which is not that far away that we achieved in Q4 of last year of 20.4%. And obviously we are, as you have noted, expecting higher revenue on an easier compare. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First question for me was on China. It seems like for the most part this sector has seen a modest improvement, or at least stability, in that region this quarter. And there may be a couple outliers where we saw commentary that was perhaps more cautious. So, if you could talk a little bit about what you saw there across your end markets and what\\'s baked into your expectations. Sure, Isaac. Thanks again for joining the call. I just got back from a week or so in China in the early part of April, and I\\'ll share with you today in the call what I shared with our board at the time, which was I continue to see a gradually improving overall market environment in China. I think that there\\'s a level of pessimism about the China market, which I think is not called for. When you look at where the market is growing, and we put up high single digit market growth orders in our second quarter, you see a continued strong pharma, biopharma investments in life sciences, in human health. We see that much of the reorganization of the food ministries are behind us. In fact, I had an opportunity to represent Agilent at the BOA conference where we heard President Xi talk about his Silk Road policy, and there is also a major forum on food safety, which I participated in. And there\\'s no doubt that the food safety areas will be back on track in terms of investment. And then I think you\\'re seeing – you can count on really strong growth in the environmental segment for I think years to come. I think the one area which was a little bit more subdued in terms of overall growth would be the chemical and energy space, but that we expect still to grow in the low-single digits. So I think that the days of those double-digit market growth in China are behind us, but I think you can expect to see solid market growth in China throughout the rest of this year. Great. That\\'s helpful. And just dovetailing on your last comment there about chemical and energy, it\\'s obviously I think 25% of the business now, so perhaps maybe a little more important than we\\'ve previously appreciated. And it\\'s no surprise obviously that the commodity price there has hurt spending. But I\\'d be curious, in the past you\\'ve talked about how when the commodity prices come down, there\\'s actually a bit of an uptick that you see downstream in the markets you serve on the chemical side that are oil-price sensitive, so I\\'d be curious if you could talk a little bit about from a timing perspective. How we should think about that tailwind kind of helping to offset the CapEx pressure. Thanks, Isaac. You have a great memory on earlier conversations. So, in fact, what I think I\\'ll do is I\\'ll pass it over to Patrick. He can provide some insights on that end market. Yeah, thank you, Mike. And you\\'re right – it makes up about 25 – chemical and energy makes up about 25% of Agilent\\'s business, and – but as a reminder, the decline is mainly driven by the impact on the falling oil prices. And we have seen most of it on the customers on the exploration side. And actually that segment is only 15% of our chemical and energy segment overall. So I think actually there is some upside still on the chemical side based on the lower feedstock prices that has not yet materialized. I think these customers are still a little cautious to start more spending. So we will continue to carefully monitor the situation. But I don\\'t see any immediate changes or more dramatic reductions in the business overall. I think, again, there will be into 2016, probably you will see the shortfall on the exploration side, but it\\'s positive momentum what we can expect – positive momentum on the chemical side. Hey, thanks. Mike, can you just clarify how much of the $30 million delay was self-inflicted versus – the shipping center stuff versus the customer order side? And on the customer side, was that all academic? Tycho, you kind of broke up a bit in the call. I think you\\'re asking about the breakdown of the $30 million revenue? Oh, yeah. Got it. Got it. It\\'s roughly 50%-50%. So, about $15 million of it was through the start-up issues with our logistics network in the United States, and the other $15 million was from very late coming in orders that we couldn\\'t turn into revenue within the quarter. And then can you maybe touch on share dynamics? I\\'m sure we\\'re all going to get the question tomorrow, given that Waters have been up 15% organic. Can you maybe just talk about how much of what you\\'re seeing was – I mean the order book was up 6%, so that\\'s the silver lining. But can you just talk about your ability to hold share in this environment? And any color on pricing would be helpful too. We\\'re doing more than holding share, we\\'re taking share is our view because we had 10% core order growth in the marketplace, and with the one exception of Waters, I don\\'t think anybody\\'s putting up numbers like this in the space. And as you may be able to dig into some of the details and remarks, some of the areas where we compete directly with Waters in LC, LC-MS and pharma and biopharma, I think, Patrick, you might want to jump on this as well. We saw very, very strong growth. So, I think there is a different composition of our portfolio and end-market play than Waters, but where we compete we\\'re clearly holding our own. Absolutely. And I want to speak here only to the auto side because we had these issues on the revenue side. But both in LC as well as in MS, our orders have been up double-digit, so we see a strong momentum, as I said in the beginning, behind our new Infinity II series and also behind our – mainly behind our high-end LC-MS systems like the 6495 Tripe Quad. So I would say we are competing very effectively. Mike, just a question on the pharma market. I think this is the first time in a little while you\\'ve mentioned a large pharma group as being a source of strength in the period. Are you seeing a recovery from that customer base? And just kind of talk about the outlook I guess for the balance of the year in the pharma market. Yeah, good catch, because we\\'ve been talking before about the small and medium size in specialty pharma, so it\\'s a broad-based recovery, and we\\'re really starting to see the large pharma investing and really coming off their delayed technology refresh plan. So I think that\\'s why Patrick mentioned earlier the very strong growth we\\'re seeing in our LC and LC-MS product line. So, this is a much larger broad-based recovery across pharma than we have pointed to in the past. And then biopharma continues to be a strong segment in the industry as well. And one more for Didier. Given the Dako resolution came in about six months earlier than planned, curious why the incremental spend that\\'s baked into the outlook isn\\'t lower I guess relative to the prior view of about $15 million of incremental spend. Good question, Brandon. It is slightly lower. We are planning to spend about $15 million. There is a lot of work that needs to be done towards – until about June, and then we will stop seeing a serious pay down of the expenses. But don\\'t forget, I mean we are very, very serious on investing whatever we need to make sure that we comply with all the regulatory requirements. And Jacob, you probably want to add too. Yes. Surely, I mean first of all, we are obviously very pleased that we received the notice from FDA that the warning letter has been lifted, and as Didier\\'s also mentioning we will finalize the activities that we\\'ve committed to, to close out with FDA. Therefore, the spending is also a little bit lower than what we have guided earlier, but we will also continue to invest in a higher compliance level going forward. Good afternoon, guys. So I guess as we try to put tonight\\'s print in context, obviously, CapEx business or the backlog swings, we\\'ve seen these before. But it seems to happen here a little bit more than we\\'ve seen it at some of the other CapEx-focused players. So Mike, you\\'ve been spending a lot of time trying to reinvigorate sales and the sales organization, and obviously you\\'ve got your margin discipline you\\'re also trying to execute against. I mean as you think about all of the various moving parts here, do you feel like pushing the organization to degree that you are, this is sort of the result? Or do you think this is purely kind of just, hey, we just didn\\'t execute and things need to change? I\\'m just trying to figure out how to isolate – we heard the explanation before – kind of how to put in context all of the moving parts with kind of the outcome. Because obviously you sound excited, but I think the stock\\'s 5% now; the shareholders aren\\'t nearly as excited today. So I\\'m trying to figure out how to put that all together. Hey, Ross, thanks for the question and the acknowledgment of the efforts we have underway to really accelerate traction in a couple of key topics for us on a strategic nature. So, great question. So when I step back from them and look at this, which is, I went to great lengths to highlight the start-up issue we had with logistics center. But – and I think it\\'s an evidence of the new Agilent in terms of we\\'re going to make bold moves. We\\'re going to drive towards changing our cost structure. When we\\'re done here, we\\'ll have probably $3 million or so out of our cost structure, much improved customer experience. So – and then when I found out about my team and I learned about my team is when we have issues, such as the one we discovered once we went live in the later part of March, we got all over it. What I didn\\'t share with you was also the fact that we delivered 10% order growth in the midst of a major field reorganization. So I think that we\\'re not pushing the team too hard. We have the ability to execute and to drive the company forward aggressively. There will be – perhaps will be some times won\\'t go completely according to plan. But what this team will do is get all over it as a team and work very quickly to address it. So hopefully that gives you some insight in terms of how the company is running inside. We\\'re enthusiastic, we\\'re energized, and I don\\'t think anybody believes that they\\'re overly taxed yet. And maybe as a follow-up, so you bought a little bit more stock this quarter, but it\\'s still a pretty small amount relative to your overall share mix. So we just saw last week, one of your larger peers buy a separations chromotography asset for 19 times EBITDA. As you think about sort of the value of your asset, particularly relative to all of the things you\\'re doing to hopefully augment and fix and improve the profitability of it, as you think about sort of harnessing some of those returns for Agilent shareholders, and maybe you\\'ll cover it in more detail at the Analyst Day. But how are you guys thinking about the share buyback, just given sort of all the various data points out there in the market? Yes, thank you, Ross, for that question. So right now, what you heard today was that we\\'re doing what we said we would do, which is we would buy back $365 million of stock, and we are well on our way to doing that. However, as also I\\'ve said in prior calls, we continue to look at our overall capital allocation policy, how we\\'re deploying capital for return to shareholders. And perhaps as a teaser for the May Analyst Meeting next week, I\\'ll say more to come. CrossLab was a little lower growth in the current quarter than the 10% or so organically in January\\'s quarter. Was that due to this re-org you were talking about, Mike, or what was going on with CrossLab? Was it weather, et cetera? No, we\\'ve got a lot of our – and Mark you can jump in as well. We got a lot of our revenue hung up in the logistics center issue that I talked about earlier, because we have such a high velocity of consumables and support parts going through, not only the U.S. logistics center for U.S. customers, but also as a gateway into our global customer base as well. So you\\'ll note in our prepared remarks, I think we had 12% organic order growth. So it really was a story on the logistics center. But Mark, anything else you want to add? Well there\\'s the other nuance, Mike, which in services, obviously order growth doesn\\'t translate immediately to revenues. And this 12% growth, a lot of that came through services. And what you\\'ll see is that becomes an annuity stream going forward for the remaining quarters. So I would say we put some money in the bank for looking out into the next year. Yeah and then, Paul, that\\'s also why again there\\'s been a lot of questions about the second half revenue outlook, and this is one of the reasons why we\\'re confident in our outlook. Is CrossLab one of the major reasons you think you\\'re taking share, along with the obviously the instrument technology. But is it a reason? We think it\\'s a combination of both, right. So we\\'re driving really new innovative new solutions, so we\\'re putting more instruments into the marketplace and taking share. But we also embrace in a strategy which I think, and we\\'ll go through some level of detail next week, where we really believe there\\'s a broad-based play across the whole laboratory environment, not only for services and consumables for our instrumentation, but in the broader vendor base as well. And I think it\\'s very clear that we\\'re picking up very good business and services in consumables, and I\\'m guessing it\\'s above market. I certainly think it is, Mike, but I would say what our intent is, obviously to ensure we differentiate all of the solutions Agilent brings to the market. I feel confident a lot of the innovation we have is driving that share gain. It was negative on the revenue side and the positive on the order side, and revenue was kind of a negative low single digit. Yes, exactly. And perhaps low to mid single digits on the revenue side. And again, as Patrick said, it\\'s very difficult this quarter to talk about revenue considering the $30 million. And for example, a lot of that impacted China because although we kind of recovered some towards the end of the quarter, because of the shipment times, we were not able to recognize revenue, in particular in China. It was the region that was the most impacted by the $30 million revenue shortfall. The facility is in the U.S., but it ships all over on whatever is produced in the U.S. And including, for example, it ships GCMS into China, and because of a long transit time, China was positively impacted. Let\\'s just start by rounding out the geography. You called out Japan. So subsequent to the revenue commentary, you made a comment there, much like China, that the orders were very strong. It seems like while you\\'re certainly not the first to call out Japan as an area where there are a few moving parts, can you give us a sense for what it is that you\\'re seeing in Japan? Number one, is this an area where some of the shipment delays are having an impact? Number two, to the extent there is any softness there, where are you seeing it? And number three, how do you see it playing out over the balance of the year? Yes sure. thanks, Steve, for the opportunity to talk, provide some insight into Japan. Different story from my perspective than China. Though we were pleased to see the order growth that we saw in Q2, we have to keep in mind that it was off a relatively easy compare in 2014. And I think we know the history there with the Japanese implementation, the VAT tax, and how it really changed the seasonality of orders for everybody in the early part of last year. What we\\'re seeing going forward is a environment where we\\'re expecting continued weakness in the academia and government segment. The quantitative easing budget money doesn\\'t seem to be really flowing into our space. The flip side of that is, we\\'re actually seeing improvements in the private sector. Now it\\'s a very fragile environment right now, but we think that if it\\'s holding together, we expect it to be subdued. It won\\'t be the same level of growth as you\\'re going to see in China, but we\\'re also not seeing any kind of significant downturn. And Didier, I don\\'t know if you have any other observations on Japan. No, I mean what we are seeing and what we\\'ve started seeing in April certainly seems to tie also with the general projections from the economies that are seeing that after Q1 with a negative GDP growth, Q2, Q3 growth will accelerate and will clearly be positive during those two quarters. So we are hoping that they are right for the one. Okay, very helpful. And then, just one housekeeping question for Didier. With Cartagenia now in the books and the XRD transaction, can you give us a sense for how much incremental we should expect on the top line from these transactions over the balance of the year and hopefully for next fiscal year? Thanks so much. Yes, let\\'s say that for the immediate future, it\\'s not going to move the needle, and I probably would leave it at there. Jacob, do you want to add any color? No, I agree, Didier. I mean first of all, most impact of Cartagenia is going to be minimal in the short-term future in the whole Agilent picture. But I do believe that Cartagenia is a very important pillar in our strategy going forward, where we want to really develop the workflows into pathology labs and focusing on – and on genetic disorder labs also. I certainly couldn\\'t agree more, but just to put a finer point on it, between XRD and Cartagenia, can you give us any sense for what the run rate in terms of dollars was on revenue for those businesses? Thanks so much. Didier, I\\'ll just jump in. On the XRD, it was a little less than $15 million or so of revenue, and then we had about 88 employees associated with that business mainly in Poland that now have joined Rigaku. Anything else you want to add, Didier? Afternoon, guys. Thanks. Mike, does the outlook for the rest of the year pretty much assume that demand from the energy customers stays where it is? Or are you assuming you maybe start to get a little bit of relief. You\\'ve gotten a slight rebound in crude prices over the last month or so. I\\'m not sure that\\'s meaningful to your thinking at all. No, great question, Dan. Thanks for the opportunity to comment. No, we\\'re not expecting any kind of rebound, just staying the status quo. If – I think Patrick pointed to more of a 2016 kind of up rebound on the chemical side of that. So it happened before, that would represent upside to our thinking, but we\\'re not currently forecasting that. Okay, thanks. And then Didier, on the Agile Agilent savings, should we look for what\\'s left on the $50 million for the year to be recognized pretty evenly in the back half? Or might that be weighted towards one quarter than the other? No, I mean it\\'s slightly obviously a little bit more in Q4, but Q3 is going to be fairly significant. So, perhaps 45/55 in the second half between Q3 and Q4. Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Mike, do you think the customer order patterns have changed permanently, or was there something unique to the quarter that you called out? And then secondly, I guess, have you seen any change in the order cancellation rate? Yes, Jeff, great question. So in fact, we\\'ve really been asking ourselves all the same question, which is, we saw a different seasonality in this Q2 than last year. So all we kept coming back to was we really can\\'t control the customer buying behavior. So I really don\\'t have a good solid answer for you. But what we are going to do, and I think I hinted at it earlier, we\\'re going to be adjusting our revenue forecasting models, sort of increasingly mindful of what seemed to be a changed timing of order flow within the quarter, so does seem to be customer-driven. I can\\'t really put a logical explanation behind it. So what we want to do is we want to evolve in our forecasting models from a revenue standpoint. And in terms of order cancellation, it\\'s not at all on our radar screen as a topic of concern. Got it, okay that\\'s great. And just a follow-up, Didier, can you give us a segment break down for the $30 million of I guess of orders that got slipped out of the quarter? It was mostly around LSAG. I mean clearly, DGG had no impact; ACG a little bit, but relatively minimum. It was mostly LSAG instruments. Mostly instruments. Hey, so sticking with Jeff\\'s question, changes in ordering patterns, but was there any sort of pricing competition at the end of the quarter, any unusual changes from your competitors? Or is it just customers just behaving differently? Yeah, as I look around the conference room here, everybody is shaking their head no. No really significant changes from competitors or pricing behaviors. Okay and on – you\\'ve gotten rid of NMR, XRD. Is there anything else within that old Varian business? For example, the old vacuum pump business that is no longer core to the organization? Yeah, no, thanks for the great question. So I think that you see, Derik, that we\\'re continuing to look at our portfolio and we\\'re quite happy with the status of the portfolio right now. And in fact, on the vacuum side, we\\'re seeing – I\\'ve got a profitable business that we actually see has a fair amount of synergies in Agilent, particularly as we think about designing and developing next-generation of mass spectrometry and kind of being able to integrate the pumps in a different manner, in terms of our new systems, albeit, also the fact that we\\'ve integrated them on a sales-force perspective to also take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the analytical lab. We see it as an enabler for our CrossLab business. So, I\\'ve got a business that\\'s making money, and I can see the synergies with the rest of the company. So it\\'s solid right now within Agilent. Great and just one final question. So you said XRD was about $15 million, and remind me what the NMR hit was to this year? Yes, on the year-over-year basis, it was relatively minimum. I\\'ll give you the numbers. But it had a much bigger impact on orders, obviously, because we stopped taking orders. So last year, we had about $50 million of orders for the whole year on NMR, and this year, is even slightly negative because we canceled a few of the orders in the backlog. And in terms of revenue last year, we had about $80 million in revenue. This year, we\\'ll have about $65 million, and we\\'ll have some revenue even next year as we recognize revenue on the last OEM magnet that we stopped taking orders on back two years ago, but we are still shipping. Yes, good afternoon guys. Let me start with a question on the sales-force reorganization. Perhaps remind us how exactly you reorganized, other than the divisional changes that you made. Perhaps a little bit more on the things that we cannot see from the outside: incentives, territories, compensation. It sounds like you didn\\'t think this impacted your ability to close orders. But give us a sense as to when you might see perhaps, a positive impact from the reorganization? Yes, thank you, Miro. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So I think we\\'re already – I\\'ll go in a second on the details of the reorganization, but we\\'re already seeing the impact, which is again, I think phenomenal order results in the second quarter, building on a strong Q1. And what we\\'ve done is we\\'ve gone from five sales forces to two. We have one sales force that\\'s focused on the diagnostic and genomics area, which is really our regulated marketplace. And then we now have one sales force that covers the entire analytical lab from pharma, chemical, environmental, food, forensics, life science research, and as I mentioned earlier, also inclusive of the vacuum. Those organizations previously were three separate organizations, and it led to a lot of extra cost. But even – perhaps even more importantly, it led to a lot of unnecessary internal interaction about accounts assigned, the territory assignments, was this a life science account or a chemical analysis account? That dialogue is completely gone now. We\\'ve integrated under one global leader, and now all of our energy is focused on optimal territory assignments, taking care of the customers, and taking share from the competitors. So I couldn\\'t be more delighted in terms of how the integration and reorganization of our sales force has gone. And again, I think it\\'s going to allow us to put more energy, more resources, more focus on front-line channel expansion, as opposed to internal dialogue and cost structure. Patrick, do you want to add anything? Yes, I just want to add in terms of what you probably don\\'t see from the outside is in terms of the divisional changes we made is we made a significant change in our MS business. We basically brought together the TCM LCMS business and 50% of all the labs organization into one new strong mass spectrometer group. And I think the result of that will basically we see more in the future, as we have now much more horsepower on the R&D side to develop new product for what we see as the fastest growing market segment for us. Yeah. Thanks for that, Patrick. And we talk internally and here we talk next week about One Agilent, we really are trying to leverage the full power of this company by organizing ourselves to get the maximum leverage out of the capability we have with the company Okay. Thank you very much for this color. And on the FDA warning resolution, congrats on getting this ahead of time. You already commented a little bit on the cost side. But do you have – does this allow you to launch new products? Do you have anything in the pipeline that you could start launching now post-remediation? Yeah, absolutely, and you\\'re right on, of course having to deal with an FDA warning letter, you have a lot of operational focus on dealing with that warning letter and taking some of our focus away from new product development. Fortunately, we have more sites. We have had strong development activities on other sites like the Carpinteria side and also our genomics side. We, in particular, within our companion diagnostic, we are looking into some very, very exciting launches coming up over the next quarters. I think you heard already Mike alluding to Merck & Co. has communicated their ambitions within the PDL1 assay – PDL1 drug target, and we are together with them on coming out with a PDL1 assay. And we definitely look into over next quarters at least one launch in that area maybe even two. And on the genomics side, we have had quite a lot of exciting launches this quarter also that I could talk a long time about, but I don\\'t think we have time for it right here. In the diagnostics business, just going through the slides, the delayed Q1 shipments, is there a way to quantify what that helped in the quarter? And then as you look into the back half, just being able to press some of the better growth now that you\\'re past the warning letter and the manufacturing issues there? Yes, thanks, Jack, for the question. I\\'ll pass it over to Jacob or perhaps, Didier, you want to weigh in on this as well? Well, you are definitely right that our performance this quarter is a bit skewed by these orders that return to revenue into Q2. But we have an underlying business improvement, both in the pathology business with the rest of the portfolio that will start now to drive the underlying business growth. So I expect to see an improvement in our performance on all elements, especially particularly in the pathology business. We once again saw record placements of Omnis, and this is a great indicator that we will start to see strong traction in the pathology business. So I\\'m very comfortable – confident that we received the growth coming from the business going forward. And then, yeah, just the last one, Didier. You mentioned the hedging cadence in the quarter. Can you just remind us how that works, and then is there a way to quantify on the earnings side what the total FX impact was? Yes, absolutely. So we have, in addition to our structural hedging program, we hedge both our balance sheet and our cash flow, and the accounting treatment is different. The balance sheet hedging gains and losses show up in other income and expense below the line, whereas the cash flow hedges, the financial impact of the cash flow hedges shows up in cost of sales. And as there was the fairly dramatic, as you have noticed disconnection of changes in currency rates in the last two or three quarters, I mean we have had fairly significant currency hedging gains. In Q1 they were about $3 million to $4 million. In Q2, they were about $7 million, so this Q2. And because we settled the hedging programs always at the beginning of the quarter, we already know what our currency hedging gains will be in Q3. And they will be about $3 million. So there\\'s a $4 million reduction in hedging gains, and that reduction shows in the cost of sales of gross margin. So that\\'s why I was mentioning everything else being the same, gross margin would be impacted to the tune of 0.4 percentage points sequentially. Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\\'ll turn the call back over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us a call, and we\\'d like to wish you all a good day. Thanks again. Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

Today Agilent reported first quarter revenues of $1.03 billion, an increase of 2% versus last year. Orders of $995 million were up 2% over year ago, operating margin was 17.2%, earnings per share were $0.41. Mike and Didier will provide further details about Agilent’s Q1 performance, but before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to take a moment to thank the investor community for your ongoing support of Agilent. As most of you know, this will be my last earnings call as Agilent\\'s CEO. I am very proud of the accomplishments the team has made over the last 10 years. In 2005 we launched a strategic initiative to focus on our core expertise of measurement science and direct investments into the life science markets. We divested our semiconductor related businesses, SPG now Avago, our semiconductor test business Verigy, now part of Advantest in our solid state illumination joint venture, Lumileds with Philips. With the Electronic Measurement business is the foundation of a Company, we embarked on a journey to turn a hardcore electronics company into a life science and diagnostics company. As a result of the enormous effort of the team, excellent organic growth and several key acquisitions, we have grown our analytical instrumentations, genomics and diagnostic business from $1.4 billion to $4 billion per year-on-year revenue gaining the number two position in the marketplace. This success led to our recently completed split of the company and the creation of Keysight Technologies. The ability of the company transform itself while spinning off or divesting businesses is a testament to the skills and dedication of its employees. Of course the work of the new Agilent is not done. We need to manage through the added cost of the separation to synergy and drive our operating margins higher. We will continue our commitment to be a leader in our market and we must capture the returns from the investment we have made in the clinical and diagnostic markets. Mike and his team are well prepared to lead the Company forward. Mike has a proven track record of building very profitable, market leading businesses. Mike\\'s new team has all the expertise, skills and drive to move Agilent forward. I believe our investors, customers and employees are in excellent hands. And now I’ll turn it over to Mike. Thanks, Bill. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible job that Bill has done leading this Company for the past 10 years. He not only transformed Agilent into an industry leader in life sciences, but is leaving us in a very strong position for our journey ahead. And on a personal note I could not ask for better partner during the CEO transition. Thanks Bill. Now I would like to share some additional insights on the transition and the quarterly results. The transition with Agilent is full swing. At the start of Q1 we announced the most expansive reorganization in our Company’s history. Three new business groups were formed to drive expansion in the core Analytical Lab and leverage its leading position to further penetrate the connected clinical research and diagnostics markets. We launched an Agile Agilent program to streamline and create a more nimble customer focused and faster moving company. In Q1 we delivered a strong start to the year, driven by the strength of our core Analytical Lab business. We delivered 2% reported growth or 6% core growth. We have strong profitability despite currency headwinds and challenges in our diagnostics and genomics business. Our Analytical Lab business, which represents 86% of the total Company is comprised of two recently reported business segments, the Life Sciences and Applied markets group and the Agilent CrossLab group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group LSAG brings together Agilent’s Analytical Laboratory instrumentation and informatics. LSAG’s revenues grew 2% reported growth or 5% on a core basis. Growth was broad based across most product lines and end markets. Operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%. Our growth continues to be driven by innovative new offerings. The Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC System which we launched in Q4 has been extremely well received by the market. This system sets a new benchmark in analytical instrument and laboratory efficiency. New spectroscopy products such as recently released FTIR, imaging hardware and software enhancements are accelerating research through improved workflows and opening up imaging to a wider range of non-spectroscopy customers. The new Agilent CrossLab Group, ACG which combines our Analytical Lab services and consumables business under a new Agilent brand delivered outstanding results. ACG revenues grew 5%, up 10% on a core basis. Growth was strong across consumable supplies, columns, sample prep and services. This reflects the innovative products we are bringing to market and the customer value proposition of our CrossLab strategy. We saw exceptional growth and demand for our QuEChERS sample prep kits. The introduction of RFID Inventory Management services were also well received by the market and customers. Operating margin for ACG was 20.7%. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions. First, former Dako Company’s focus on pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnerships. Second, the genomics division includes our arrays, NGS Target Enrichment and our other genomic solutions. Third, the Nucleic Acid solution division manufactured synthetic RNA to be potentially used an active pharmaceutical ingredients. DGG’s first quarter revenues declined 6% year-over-year down 1% on a core basis. We enjoyed record placements of Omnis Instruments, strong companion diagnostic business and strong SureSelect NGS Target Enrichment business. However, both of our Nucleic Acid businesses were significantly impacted by manufacturing issues that were resolved late in the quarter. Operating margin was 0.5%, impacted by the lower revenues and the remediation expenses to last year’s FDA warning letter. Those remediation efforts are going well on track with our expectation to be completed by Q4. We continue to strengthen our portfolio. In January DGG launched a new generic sure pre-screen kit. This kit provides an innovative test for abnormal number of chromosomes. At the same time DGG launched a new release of its cytogenetic software, which enables rapid analysis of samples processed with a pre-screen kit. Together this solution provides a faster turnaround on the market. Also in January we announced a strategic partnership with Cell Signaling Technology to supply antibodies for use with Dako-branded diagnostics products. We expect to return DGG to low double digit operating margins in Q2, driven by a recently announced restructuring initiative, and a return to normal manufacturing operations at our California and Colorado sites. Now let’s take a look at Agilent’s total Company performance by end markets on a reported basis. Pharma revenues were 6%. We saw strength in technology refresh deals, helping demand in mid to small sized pharma and sustaining growth in the aftermarket. We continue to see improving conditions in life science research or Academia & Government of 1% with increased funding from Europe and China. Demand for high end LCMS as well as GC, GC-MS, informatics and consumables drove results. Our Food Testing business grew 5%. We had solid growth worldwide as governments and major food manufacturers managed the challenges of a complex global food supply and public food safety demands. Environmental markets grew 4%, driven by China and the continuous focus on creating a cleaner environment. In addition to increasing enforcement of its existing environmental regulations, China is developing new monitoring methods and legislation driving growth in this space. Chemical Energy revenues were flat year-over-year as the industry responds to a greater than expected drop in oil prices. We saw a slight decline in Forensics down 2% as some U.S state and federal U.S agencies have delayed their capital purchases due to some budget uncertainty.  Turning to Clinical and Diagnostics, revenues declined 4% over a year ago. Their primary driver is manufacturing capacity constraints addressed late in the quarter. Geographically Americas grew 3%, Europe 2% and Asia 1%. China revenue, including Hong Kong was a source of strength, up by double-digits on demand from Food and Environmental customers and a relatively easy compare. On the other hand revenues in Japan were down 19%. This was primarily currency related due to the weakening yen, along with a difficult year-over-year compare. Moving to the year ahead in our last call I highlighted three focus areas to drive shareholder value. One, grow organically at the high end of the market; two, aggressively expand operating margins; three, deploy capital for long-term shareholders value. Moving from our update on the strong Q1 core growth, a few highlights on our operating margin improvement initiatives and capital deployment. The exit of the NMR hardware business announced in October is proceeding as planned. In Q1 we completed the closure and sale of our Lake Forest, California chemistry manufacturing site and consolidation of production volume into an existing Ashland site. We have initiated a restructuring program as part of the Company\\'s reorganization. We have also launched a multiyear Agile Agilent program, reengineering our Company to be a more nimble, efficient and customer focused. We expect gross savings of a minimum of $50 million in 2015 from all these actions. We will also continue to tax effectively deploy capital for a long-term shareholders value. This year as previously stated, we intend to return $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We will complete the CEO transition at the March 18th Shareholders Meeting with my new leadership team fully in place. My new team and I look forward to our May 28 Analyst Meeting in New York. At this meeting I will outline my strategic vision for the Company, our plans to outpace the market, drive EPS growth and achievement of our long-term operating model. It\\'s a full core press within Agilent to stay in our core growth trajectory, mitigate currency headwinds and drive earnings. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\\'s financial results and guidance. Didier? Thank you Mike and hello everyone. To summarize Q1 results, we delivered on our revenue and EPS midpoint guidance, even as currency impacted our revenue by $12 million and our EPS by $0.01. Also, adjusting for the $11 million reimbursements from key sites for Agilent IT and site services, our operating margin was 18.2%, 1 percentage point higher than the reported operating margin. Regarding our Q1 negative operating margin cash flow of $20 million, it was impacted by three factors. First, separation related expenses amounted to $33 million; second; transformation and  expenses amounted to $14 million; and third, we paid $42 million in taxes related to the spin. In addition we paid in December as usual the variable compensation related to the previous six months. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2015. The strengthening of the U.S dollar since our last guidance has a negative impact of $130 million on our revenue, $30 million on operating profit and $0.08 on our EPS. However thanks to the strength of our business and the initiatives underway that Mike mentioned, we anticipate offsetting about $0.05 of the currency impact. We are therefore only slightly modifying our previous guidance. We expect fiscal year \\'15 revenue of $4.06 billion to $4.12 billion. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth will be 1% on a reported basis but 6.9% on a core basis, the difference due to currency. Our core growth is driven by strong order funnel, expected recovery in our DGG business, the impact of a significant number of new products and continued improvement and demand from China. We project fiscal year ’15 EPS to range from a $1.67 to $1.73 with a midpoint of a $1.70. Please note that our EPS guidance assumes 338 million shares and that our annual operating cash flow is projected at $550 million. Finally moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we expect Q2 revenues of $985 million to a $1,005 million and EPS of $0.37 to $0.41. At midpoint revenue will grow 0.7% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7.5% on a core basis, the difference again as a result of currency. At midpoint, Q2\\'s adjusted operating margin of 18.2% will be 130 basis points higher than last year’s. Thank you.  And our first question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead. I have a question on your sales to Chemical and Energy companies. Is flat performance you reported in the quarter -- is that a reasonable reflection for how you expect sales in these end markets to trend with current oil prices or is there downside to this result? This is Mike. I think I want to pass it over to one of the newcomers on the call, Patrick Kaltenbach, who manages our Life Science and Applied Markets Group for his commentary on the impact of oil prices in that segment. Thank you, Mike. And we have reported our growth in the Chemical Energy segment actually have been flat this quarter. The negative impact of the oil price will most likely be seen, more of our customers who are on the exploration side and they make up about 15% of our total Chemical and Energy segment. The stronger part of the segment is actually on the Chemical side, which actually could see some nice tailwind moving forward with lower feedstock prices.  Well, as I would say, it\\'s the current version we see. Moving forward again I think both sides probably haven’t fully appreciated the oil price yet. You might see a little down turn on the exploration side, but on the other side, there might be also an upside, moving forward on the chemical side using the lower feedstock prices. And just to close off on Patrick’s comments, as he\\'s mentioned, only about 15% of this segment is actually impacted directly by the downward trend in terms of the less capital expenditure on the exploration side of the business, and we expect a continued re-pleasant  market in this with stability in this market segment. And then my follow-up, could you elaborate on the performance in China and whether you\\'re seeing confirmation of the improved trends that you’ve baked into your guidance? Yes, as we’ve talked in the prior calls we’ve been fairly transparent in China about some of the operational issues we had historically and also our commentary has been that we were projecting a gradually improving market environment in China and I would say that in the first quarter we saw it actually come to fruition. So under the backdrop of gradually improving market environment, we’ve seen a return for example of some food deals. Our operational issues are behind us and we believe we’re growing above market in China. It will be a source of strength for us in 2015. Hey Bill, thanks for being a straight shooter for 10 years and congratulations. I guess my question would be you’ve had pretty exceptional growth in Europe as well. How do you explain that dynamic win has obviously been a risk area? Paul, I’ll go ahead and take call, Bill is saying, hey Mike it\\'s now your turn to feel the calls after 10 years of very transparent dialogue and you will find me to also be a straight shooter Paul, on these calls and our dialogues as well. I think it really comes back to the core of the strength of Agilent, which is the innovation, our go-to-market strategy. So we believe that in Europe, like other parts of world, we have been bringing to market some very innovative new offering to the customer and have a unique strategy focused on the CrossLab, both the services and consumer aspect and informatics of the laboratory. So we think the combination of our go-to-market strategy, the innovations that we’ve had in terms of the new product introductions, as well as our clear intent to go after not only the technology aspect of the lab, but the services that our consumables and informatics side of the lab has allowed us to, to outpace the market, in particular Europe performance has been really strong relative to the competition. Mike, it looks like your growth rate in analytical was above market. Do you think you are taking share and one of you been – from your experience in Wilmington, what’s happening the right way for you to be doing this kind of share gain? Yes, Paul thanks for the question. And when we looked at the performance for the first quarter, we had 6% core growth and if you actually stripped out the NMR, its 7% growth for us in the first quarter. I think it’s always -- I\\'ll leave the are we gaining market share question to my competitors. But we think that this recipe of new product innovation and really making sure our operational challenges are behind us and picking the right leaders I would add are really driving this strong growth and the growth across our portfolio is really broad based and in fact I’ll ask Patrick to make some few comments here as well. One other thing I forgot to mention Paul around our results in Europe, we had a very strong European regional manager who now is running our global sales operations and the new analytical lab sales force. So quite confident that the  will bring his talent to the globalization and you\\'ve seen his success already in Europe. And Patrick, maybe a little bit more comment on what you saw in the lab site for the instruments and then Mark, you can jump in on the CrossLab. Sure, thanks Mike. We definitely seen a lot of momentum based on our new regionally introduced portfolio and solutions like the Infinity II series LC that we launched in Q4, the ICP OES, the FTIR and high end MS solutions. Those products have been really well received by our customers and we actually have a very strong funnel behind these products. And that’s also why we are looking forward also to very successful Q2. Thanks Patrick and Mark, if could make a few comments on the CrossLab where the growth was really quite exceptional as we close off this question. Thanks Mike and obviously with the 10% core growth rate, we had strength in a lot of areas, but I would call out we had exceptional strength in the Americas with both the LC columns and in China our small molecules in general are growing and certainly -- so on the services side we continue to see in Europe in particular, growth from our enterprise services as well as our instrument services side. Mike can you just talk on multi-progression for the quarter? Just trying of get a sense of how January faired versus December and the strength of the order book exiting the quarter? Thanks for that question Tycho. So we saw solid order strength through the quarter. I would say we always get little bit of bump at the end of December as lot of our customers close off their budgets and then -- but with the quarterly quota setting process in the Company, there is always incentive for the sales people to close in June and January. So really no changes from a historical seasonality patterns of business through the quarter. And as we noted in the DGG side of our business, we actually built backlog during the quarter. And to that point when do you think Darko can get back to something resembling a market growth rate? Is that a ’16 event? How do we think about the earliest you could be back to kind of a mid-single digit growth rate potentially for that business? I’ll make some initial comments here, then introduce Jacob Thaysen, our Group President for our Diagnostics and Genomics business. So as you saw on our call notes, we think we’ll be back to low double digit profitability in the second quarter. Your question really is in terms of the overall top line return to market growth and above market growth and I think it’s -- what you’ll hear from Jacob is some really aggressive plans to continue to push the growth rate and many encouraging signs, particularly with the Omnis side of things but why don’t I not steal Jacob\\'s thunder and induce you to the community here in this call. Thank you, Mike and thanks Tycho for the question. I do believe that we have an exciting opportunity also in Darko to come back and we had a record number of shipments of Omnis in this quarter. And this is actually a very good indicator for an improved position in the market. And overall the market continues to be very attractive. We -- actually I do believe we have the right solutions to regain market share. For example also on the IQ HER2 FISH site, which is a very important component in diagnosing breast cancer, we have also launched a very good product that has been able to take the turnaround time form 24 hours down to be done within the same day. And this will actually allow the laboratory to perform analysis that was not possible to do before within the same day. And we see substantial market improvement also on that. So I do believe at this point of time we have the right products, we have the right team. And we will see momentum during ’15 and into ’16 also to regain into market. Last one just on the operational initiatives you highlighted Mike, I mean I think someone argued multiple and stocks kind of given you benefit for that, maybe some M&A expectation as well. But can you just talk about what you see as kind of the path to additional value creation from what you’ve laid out here? In other words why the reluctance to buyback more stock beyond the $365 million that you talked about and the reluctance to maybe cut a little deeper bit to try to get something north of a 22% operating margin by ’17? So I think I’ll make some initial comments here and then invite Didier into the dialog as well. As I outlined in the prior call and reemphasized today, we think that the way to drive additional appreciation of our share price is to aggressively go after improvements of our operating margin. We’ve outlined I think a fairly progressive plan, 400 basis points and we consider the synergies we\\'re starting off with as a Company. I outlined in my call today some very quick and expansive far reaching changes in how the Company is operating. The story is an organic growth and cost reduction story to drive our margins up. So that\\'s how we\\'re going to do it, by working the income statement and we have fully committed this year to high use of our available cash to repurchase stock. So again, $500 million of share repurchases and dividends is a plan for 2015. And Didier, I know you\\'ve done some analysis working with external folks as well in terms of how we\\'ve modelled aspects of leverage as it relates to stock repurchases. Yes clearly the leverage and buyback programs and dividend programs are ongoing topics of discussions with the Board. And the Board is assisted by a banker in making sure that we are making the right decisions to optimize shareholders value. So it is -- right now we are authorized to distribute $500 million which basically will put us in a zero cash position in the U.S towards end of the year. So we\\'re utilizing 100% of the cash that we have available. And again the Board is always looking at ways to optimize shareholder value.  Yes this quarter we bought back just a little bit. We continued buying back little bit after the end of the quarter. We have a 10b51 filing but it was minimum, yes. But we are still planning to buy back $365 million from now to the end of the year on an opportunistic basis. And Didier, if I would just add one additional comment here, when we look at our leverage versus our peers, we\\'re right at our peer group.  Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is open please go ahead.  This is Ryan Blicker signing in for Doug. So starting with China, can you provide more color on what you\\'re seeing in China that\\'s giving you increased confidence in your guidance and what level of growth from China is implied in the 2015 guidance? Sure Ryan. I\\'d be happy to offer some commentary on China. So in terms of the overall outlook of the market we see a gradually improving environment in China. It\\'s not a snap back to the types of market growth rates we have seen historically, but a gradually improving market environment. They are investing very heavily -- for example in the environmental areas I outlined in my call notes. We have seen -- as you know there has been a massive consolidation and reorganization of the food ministries in 2014. A lot of that reorganization is behind and we\\'re starting to see some bids for some projects and orders coming through. So the indication is from a total market perspective that the market is improving, albeit on a gradual basis.  But I\\'d say the China story is -- for Agilent is not just a market improvement story, it\\'s also the fact that the operational issues which we\\'ve been very transparent in disclosing to the investment community a while back, that is completely behind us. So we\\'ve got a very strong organization that really is aggressively going after the market in China. So I think it\\'s a combination of both a gradual improvement in market environment and our operational challenges are behind us in China. And we\\'re looking at high to mid-single digit kind of growth rate in China.  And then maybe one more on DGG and some of the recent companion diagnostics announcement. There have been some exciting partnership announcements over the last few months but just trying to think out how this impact 2015 results. Can you quantify what companion diagnostics are as a percent of Agilent or DGG sales now and maybe what you expect them to be as a percent of sales exiting 2015? What we can do is we can describe the rough breakdown of the three divisions that make up the DGG segments. Roughly 60% is in the pathology companion diagnostics reagent partnership space we talked about, 35% in the genomics and about 5% in the nucleic acid solution division. So in terms of additional financial breakdown, we wouldn\\'t be providing that down to the granularity of the companion diagnostics. But what I would do is ask Jacob to share some insight in terms of what exactly is going on with Agilent\\'s business in this space and why we\\'re so excited about the future possibilities here.  Yes thanks for that Mike. I think there is two elements to companion diagnostic. One is of course the fee for service with our pharma partners where we develop the next generation companion diagnostic and I\\'m really excited about all the partnerships that we have and we have plenty more in the pipeline and I really consider us as the leader within IC and FISH companion diagnostic. But obviously the big opportunity is with the companion diagnostic on the market and each market has its own potential. So the best way of looking at this that the usual suspect in the market today is CO2  market which has an overall market opportunity of around I think it\\'s $80 million to $100 million and then you have the other one, the big one, the ALK that has right now a market opportunity around $20 million to $25 million. It is difficult to say what each market will do, but I would imagine that that the companion diagnostic market in the future will be a great growth opportunity, but from launching products and seeing that to be a significant impact on ’15, that I do not consider, but we see substantial up take in our partnerships, that has a great momentum as we speak. Within DGG, just hoping you could expand it down the manufacturing issues that you ran into with the Nucleic Acid business, now I guess how much of the DGG revenue basis that piece comprised? Yes, so as Mike alluded to we have three overall businesses, the former Dako , business, the pathology rating partnership and CDS and we actually saw performance according to our expectation on those businesses. So then we also have the genomics solutions division and then our nucleic acid solution division and in the nucleic acid solution division that’s where we saw the manufacturing chances. And as was alluded to before the genomics, the business is here, the nucleic acid solution business is very small business compared to others, but we have some larger customer and thereby moving the shipment from one quarter to the other actually have a significant impact on our overall performance. And Jacob as I recall, I think our genomics and NASD business is about 40% of the total of your segment. And then Mike or Fred on NMR, it sounds like the wind-down is on track internally there. So I guess curious what the current outlook is like for a sale of those assets, whether you\\'re seeing any interest there from growth in this space? Thanks. I\\'ll ask Patrick to provide some further insight, both in terms of the wind-down from the financial perspective, but also how we’ve been able to work with our customers, who as a result of our decision here and then we’ll double back on the question about the sales of the assets. Mike, as I said we are on track to sustain our ramp-down. We still expect that we have most of our NMR shipments completed by end of Q2. However, some of the MRI and OEM, both take until the end of the year. Also regarding the savings, we are well on track with that as promised over the last conference call which is based on the fact we have ramped down R&D and marketing as planned. When you look at our service capabilities, we have of course make sure that we are capable to service our customers, we are working closely with Mark\\'s organization to make sure we have everything in place to make sure that we can service our customers and our install base. In regards to the question about the aspect on the sale possibility, when I made the decision to exit the NMR hardware business, of course if it qualified buyer would surface and interested in taking on the full aspects and liabilities of the NMR hardware business, we will be quite open to that discussion, but we decided it was in the best interest on the Company to make a decision now to end the leading -- the implications on P&L, allows us to refocus our investment elsewhere and also to have a customer focused mitigation strategy retaining our services capabilities to support our customers. I just have one comment on the benefits of the exit. We committed to save $10 million -- to have $10 million increment operating profit in 2015 and 2016 and we are seeing much better results. So right now we’ve raised high expectations 2015 in the guidance. We expect to save $15 million and then $20 million in 2016 and that’s in our guidance. Want to follow-up with another question on NMR. Really you touched on some of the P&L benefits you\\'re looking for here and of course the organization benefits, but curious if you could maybe look at it a little bit from a working capital standpoint, just given the nature of that business and the extent to which you\\'re looking for some free cash benefits to the profile of your business ones all this is sorted out. Is there something you can quantify for us with regards to the benefits to the working capital and free cash flow? I would say in terms of free cash flow, it\\'s fairly similar to the increase in operating profit that as mentioned perhaps little bit higher, but -- and then for 2015 there is really not much difference in terms of working capital that we have, as Patrick alluded to, even though we\\'ll be -- we\\'ll have finished the production in the first-half, in the second half we’re going to do all kinds of installations and before we can . Then we have time to collect the receivables. Obviously, inventories are coming down now. I can follow-up and give you the exact amount of the reduction of working capital to expect as a consequence of the closing, but I would say it\\'s probably immaterial in the grand scheme of things. Okay. And then just a second one on tax rate. Just wondering if you could quantify some of the opportunity that you see from a long-term here, either in terms of the magnitude of tax rate you could see, and maybe the pacing around it, just the benefits you\\'re looking for if any? Well the situation for the new Agilent is we have a lot more very profitable manufacturing activities in the U.S. with reagents and then the chemistries and also some instrument manufacturing, then proportionally all Agilent that we used to in the past, as Keysight had most of their manufacturing offshore. So the consequence is that it puts pressure on our tax rate and the 20% I see as fairly sustainable over the course of the next two, three years. What we’ll see after that. Obviously there\\'s all kind of debates that I\\'m hopeful in Congress will be to different tax regime, but at this point in time the best is to assume that we will maintain our 20% tax rate in the foreseeable future. In terms of the revenue growth outlook, 200 basis points higher, I\\'m pretty sure you’re probably the Company on the planet raising guidance at this point in the year. What gives you the confidence? What’s changed exactly relative to three months ago, one or two most important things, whether it’s China or new product flow? Can you parse that out for us? Sure, Brandon. Thanks for the question and first of all, I’ll start with the strength of our Analytical Lab business in the first quarter. It has momentum, it grew 6% core growth, 7% without the NMR impact fueled by new product introductions. The new products that we highlighted in our call last several quarters are driving new growth and the operational challenges we have in China are behind us and that’s in a backdrop of a gradually improving overall China market. So point one would be strength in the Analytical Lab business fueled by new product innovations and the addressing of previously disclosed operations in China and the second one is cognizant recovery in our diagnostics and genomics business. As we outlined in our call today, we had some operational issues that are being addressed and we’re quite confident in our ability to right the ship and get that business in the direction we want it to be. So there\\'s the two things I will leave you with, strength in the Analytical Lab business and the cognizant recovery of our diagnostics and genomics business. Okay, that’s helpful. And then Didier, just on the Agilent savings plan. I think you said gross savings expected at $50 million this year. If I just think about the bridge between your prior guidance for revised outlook, can you quantify the buckets between better organic growth, currency lowers, restructuring benefits, just the moving parts? Well, I did provide the currency impact and the rest is really way too many things. We are having good momentum on the restructuring program, the $50 million. Part of $15 million is NMR, $35 million is -- I would call the Agile Agilent programs which is ramping up nicely although there were some benefits already in Q1. There is some volume benefits also. A lot of other programs -- we are also making sure that we invest properly in our businesses to support our expectations to outgrow the market. So there is really lot of things we do and bridge that very carefully within the Company but there is a lot and lot of different factors. Didier this is Mike I would just add inclusive of guiding with continued momentum the assumption our Analytical Lab business and recovery of our diagnostics and genomics business, we are also taking other actions to offset the FX win. So this isn’t just a story of momentum on the organic growth side. It’s also true costs are coming out of our structure to drive our earnings per share and we’re pulling out all stops to address these FX wins without damaging our long term growth prospects. Just want to start with I guess the life science research business here in the U.S. It sounds like the total was a little bit more muted relative to I guess slightly more optimistic commentary from peers. I guess just curious what’s driving that and what you\\'re expectations are for the rest of the year? So we have seen -- as Mike alluded to, the growth in license research this quarter was mainly driven and coming from China and Europe, actually where we have seen higher demand from life science research. In the U.S. I think we are careful optimistic for the second part of the year that some of the funds will get released, but right now that  drive is coming, the momentum is coming out of Europe and China. Okay, and then just one more I guess in getting back to the leverage and cash that you have overseas. I was wondering if you had any thoughts just on what the optimal use of that cash is and then when you’d be able to put it to work. I think as we said earlier in our call today, we’re fully committed to tax effectively returning share to our stockholders. Agilent has a long history of doing that, over $10 billion during Bill\\'s tenure as CEO and we\\'re going to continue that strategy of getting cash back in a tax effective basis to our shareholders. As you heard from Didier, pretty much all of our U.S based cash will be gone by the end of this year, having returned that to our shareholders and D, I don’t know if you have anything else you want to add here? No I\\'m certainly again waiting for some movement in Washington and hopeful and we\\'ll see. If there would be an opportunity internally to repatriate cash under our new tax regime, I would be very much inclined to do so.  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead.  I wonder if we could start with a strategic one on Pharma as an end market. The comments that you made about the growth in biotech and spec Pharma are certainly consistent with what others are saying. I wonder if you are thinking now that the growth of the submarkets in Pharma seems to have diverged. If you\\'re thinking any differently about how to approach the biotech and spec firm segments of Pharma and if you could share with us what any of those strategies might be? So why don\\'t I make a summary comments and then invite Patrick in on this dialogue as well as Jacob. So overall as we reported 6% reported growth and a very strong end market segment for the Company, and as we also have been highlighting the biopharma, the biotech side of that has been a real area of strength as you peel back the segments within Pharma, moving away from the traditional small molecule analytical side. So pinched  in both your perspectives on how you\\'re seeing that to respond to the question.  Happy to. This is Patrick speaking. So if we look at Pharma and total NMR growth comes from, of course we see all this Joe, the strong pockets like biopharma and the midsized companies but I think it would also be fair to say that during Q1 we have seen several large deals of replacement business coming from large Pharma. And as we -- so terms of strategies, there are several things for Pharma to be important. There is a lot of replacement business loss out there in big Pharma and the way we position our instrument, it\\'s making sure that we are 100% backwards compatible, while really deploying and offering the best solutions in the market and the most powerful solutions in the market. Like for example if we do see a  just recently launched this is a story that has been very well received, especially by the large Pharma companies. Now secondly when you look at biopharma, the strategy there for us is clearly working with our customers and looking at their demand, what their needs are as they develop biosimilars and other novel therapeutics, making sure we have not only the right equipment to test it, but also the right software solutions. So they have the right tools on hand to be as efficient and productive as possible.  Yes, so it\\'s our business is somewhat different from Patrick\\'s business here that we have our companion diagnostic which I have already described and then we have our Nucleic Acid solution division, which are developing or manufacturing the active ingredients for pharmaceutical components and we also see very high demand for that. So within the DGG business we continue to see a high demand from the Pharma industry.  Thank you, Jacob. And just to close out this question, just to remind those on the call, Mark\\'s, earlier comments about the growth and the services in the Pharma and how he\\'s approaching that marketplace.  And one this – I suppose this would be for Jacob. If we could just circle back to the new genetic screening kit launches that Mike referenced in his prepared remarks for chromosomal abnormalities and cytogenetics. Where are you seeing the most notable potential demand for these new kits? Is there any expanded promotional effort tied to those launches, just a little color on where you see those products headed? Thanks.  Well I would like to start by saying that we have a very, very attractive business within our array business within the cytogenetics space. This particular product is very much suited for the invitro fertilization  business where you have precious samples obviously and what it really does -- the business here is about low cost, but also about our turnaround that you can do and our product is best in class for that. So we consider this in the range of our array technologies and this particular for the invitro fertilization . Didier, I wanted to ask about some of the sensitivities around the 30% incremental operating margin that you are looking for. If your growth ended up being only 3% or 4% or alternatively if it ended up being 6% or 7%, how would that incremental operating margin change? Yes I mean we have long talked about 30% to 40% range and which to take into account, kind of reasonable low end and reasonable high end in terms of volume increase. Right now we are shooting for even higher percentage this year adjusting for the synergies. So it is sensitive but a lot of the operating margin improvement comes from hard savings and the Agile Agilent program and really kind of sneaky kind of savings. So it would have to -- we would have to face really, really bad market situation, not to deliver on this 30%, and if the market is delivering as per our expectation, if we are delivering as per our expectations, we could go on fairly significantly higher than 30%. Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey, can you give us -- what the organic revenue growth comps are for the three different segments for the second quarter since we don’t have those on historical basis? The second quarter forecast, we expect currency to have an impact of -- negative impact on the year-over-year basis from about 7 points, which mostly it\\'s around 7 points an average. And besides that we expect pretty much all the businesses to grow on a currency adjusted basis about at the same level with LSAG, perhaps one percentage point over the rest of the other two businesses. So very much in line by business with the number that we’ve provided for the Company and LSAG a little bit higher and then the currency impact being 7% impacts pretty much all the businesses of about the same way, DGG little bit more and then ACG and other two beacons. As you go into my prepared remarks, you can tease out the actual reported numbers in Q1 in terms of the corporate by segment, and obviously we would expect to see an acceleration of the growth rate in our DGG business in Q2. Right, I\\'m just trying to get to the Q2 comp, just for modeling purposes on that. And I guess the -- looking short-term at the gross margin there was the big step up like 150 basis points sequentially and year-over-year and the Agilent CrossLab Group on the new breakout. Is that just simply driven by the 10% organic revenue growth is that the volume driven thing or there is something special that went on that margin? It\\'s mostly volume adjusted. It\\'s -- as lot of headwinds and tailwinds, but obviously with 10% revenue growth, it is a big impact. On the negative side DGG is pretty much impacted by the, I mean the currency also, but anyway it is mostly on the volume and then the some programs that market will in place and last year we spent a lot of time and resources and money to deliver the new CRM which will provide a lot more effectiveness to the organization. Mike perhaps can talk a little bit about it, but that is also factor that is we expect to deliver incremental operating margin to have deliver overtime. And Mark maybe you can jump in and could we talked earlier about some of the  even tried to do year and your compares given the synergies. I think that even gives us more positive comments around our performance Q1, but any additional color you can provide here? And it is -- if you will, it\\'s a compare that going forward it’s hard to look in the past and see how these two actually compare and what we -- as Didier has indicated we actually have made investments associated with putting a single system in place to run our business and services and that will actually bring us improvements in our operating. But as being said, the synergies is related the key element of this and we\\'ll continue to work on those operational elements. But in addition to that, we obviously see top-line growth is the area we’ll continue to push forward on to. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, just I\\' wondering this a follow-up on that question, So basically when you see SG&A given the investments you’ve made, the SG&A is up here but you’ve gotten good volume leverage of the gross profit margin line? Are you explaining that? Yes, I was talking about the loss of dynamics. One of the big dynamics that we have is really the way also we allocate our share of infrastructure services, the so called GIO, and because ACG is growing faster than the -- as been growing extremely fast, they got a big lump of that allocation including some of the cost synergies that we’ve talked about over and over. So…. For Mark, is there a -- for Mark, is there opportunity on the CrossLab in the CrossLab business, by that I mean either side of the consumable side? Are we under penetrated in any particular geography? Well, we\\'ve performed well most geographies. I would say our opportunities -- looking our consumables and the chemistry and China is still I think great growth opportunity for us. China in general from a cross line perspective, we’re starting to see customer respond to enterprise services much that we’ve seen in the Western markets and in fact we\\'re seen excellent growth in the pharma segment throughout Shanghai and Beijing. Okay. And then just one last question as a follow-up, you say -- have you seen any competitive disadvantage from a pricing standpoint with the strength in the dollar in particular maybe on the analytical chemical analysis side of the business where those products, food  forensics, maybe there\\'s a little more competition there? Richard, this is Mike. I’ll take that question. Actually no I think it speaks to a couple of things, first of all the strength of the portfolio, but also the fact that with one exception most of the major competitors in this space are dealing the same FX wins. So nobody has any unique pricing power and our Japanese competitor is clearly trying to work on their margins as well. This is James Clark in for Ross. Most of my questions have been answered but I guess a quick one on the 22% margin target by 2017. I\\'m just wondering if you guys have said anything about sort of where you need to get from a segment margin perspective and specifically on the DGG side to hit that 22% If you look at the DGG business historically, this should be a strong double digit operating margin business. We’re going to be low double digits in Q2. So clearly getting to that north of 20% kind of operating margins for that business is part of the plan. And as you’ve heard from Jacob, it’s quite doable, a lot of confidence that as we have our remediation -- we move beyond our remediation efforts, we’ll have the trajectory we need in the business to attain those goals. Okay, and then just a quick one. No one asked but Japan down 6 during the quarter. I know funding has been constrained. We’ve heard some other peers talk about this. But just wondering when you sort of expect to see some clarity there and are you seeing the same dynamics as the peers or is there something specific to Agilent that’s going on in Japan right now? As you may know, I’ve spent 5.5 years of my life in Japan. So I\\'m always a little bit biased in terms of my view on Japan but if you look at what’s unique about Agilent is our position in that marketplace relative to the competition. Number two, right behind -- with obviously some other leading in that marketplace. So I think we’re seeing some of the same currency challenges that our competitors see in this space. And obviously we’re waiting for some of the -- for the budgeting discussions to conclude and get relief. Although you can’t see it in the currency results, because the currency has been such a huge impact in the most recently reported quarter. We believe we\\'re actually making some traction in that marketplace, particularly back in the discussion around services and consumables in our CrossLab site. So we often think about markets in terms of instruments, new instruments in the capital market side or capital budget side of things. But that’s been a source of strength for us. But you just can’t see it right now in the numbers given the overwhelming impact of currency. Most questions have been answered. I just have a clarification on the Diagnostics and Genomics business. It sounds like you are assuming a rebound, including on the revenue side not just the operating margin in the quarters ahead. Can you maybe help us understand what are the actions that have been completed that give you the confidence you can do that and that its turning and what still needs to be done? I guess what are the milestones that you were looking for to see the rebound? So Jacob, why don’t you comment on some of the things that are going on, on the manufacturing side relative to the 40% and what’s going on with the technology side. So thanks for the question Miro and as we also alluded to before, the main reason for our challenges on the operating profit and the revenue side in Q1 was due to some manufacturing challenges we had on our nucleic acid businesses, both genomics business and the nucleic acid solution division. Those have both been dissolved within the quarter and with that we expect to see us coming back to an on-situation in 2Q again. Well, if you look at the profitability we had in Q1 and then we’ve been fairly explicit in terms of our expectations for Q2 to low double digit profitability in Q2. So I think you can perhaps model off those vectors. Okay, thanks. And perhaps I missed it but maybe comment a little bit on the gross margin as well as R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales for the new Agilent, apart from the operating margin I guess. I\\'m not seeing explicit breakdown in the release and how those trended for the new Agilent ex Keysight? Yes. We did not provide the breakdown. We provide an EPS guidance and that we don’t provide the whole -- the full P&L. Clearly with the kind of growth that we expect you would think that our OpEx as a percentage of revenue will come down over time. Our gross margin are going up not just because of the revenue but also because of the actions that we are taking, many actions that are taking. But we don’t provide more granular detail for the guidance. Thank you. I\\'m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to hand the conference back over to the Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Thank you, Siad and thank you everybody joining us today. We appreciate you joining our call and if you have any questions, please give us a call at IR. Thank you. Bye, bye. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\\'s conference.

You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent including Keysight Technologies reported Q4 revenues of $1.81 billion, operating margin of 20.7% and earnings per share of $0.88. Keysight Technologies discussed their performance and outlook in a separate call earlier today. Accordingly, the rest of the numbers we will share today deal exclusively with Agilent’s performance in Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets. New Agilent reported fourth -- record fourth quarter revenues and orders. Revenue of $1.04 billion increased 3% versus last year, orders of $1.15 billion were up 5% over year ago, operating margin was 20.4%, book-to-bill was 1.1. In a moment, Mike and Didier will discuss the details of the Q4 performance and outlook for the new Agilent. However, I\\'d like to highlight three major accomplishments during the quarter. First, we completed the separation of the company. The Keysight and Agilent teams executed a flawless separation of the company without impacting the day-to-day business of either company. With the completion of the separation of the company, we have created two companies with greater strategic and management focus, with each company well-positioned for growth and long-term shareholder value in their respective markets. Second, during the quarter, Agilent retired an additional $500 million of debt, to maintain our leverage at a level consistent with our current investment grade rating. Third, we named a new CEO. In September, we announced that Mike McMullen had been named Agilent’s President, Chief Operating Officer and CEO-Elect. Mike will become CEO on March 18, 2015, the day of the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting. With the separation now complete, this is the perfect time to name the new CEO for the new Agilent. Mike and I are working to ensure the transition is smooth and seamless to the organization, customers and investors. Thanks, Bill. I’d like to share some of the details behind the quarter’s results. To reiterate, LDA or new Agilent’s fourth quarter revenues came in at $1.04 billion, or 3% growth year-over-year. Unfavorable currency, lower NMR revenues and late orders drove the difference from August’s guidance of $1.08 billion at the midpoint. As a reminder, in October, we announced our exit from the NMR instrument business. We are no longer taking NMR instrument orders and our current backlog will ship in 2015. Excluding NMR and currency effects, each having a negative 1 percentage point impact on reported growth, revenues grew 5% and orders grew 8% compared to a year ago. Now, turning to results by end market and growth on a reported basis. Within the Life Sciences and Applied markets, Pharma/Biotech was up 5%, driven by equipment refreshes from large and mid-size pharma customers, and continued specialty pharma demand. Life Sciences Research or academia and government was up 4% again this quarter, driven by improved government spending in the U.S. and China. Government spending particularly in the U.S. and China contributed to growth in Forensics up 6%, Food Testing up 4% and Environmental up 2% over year ago. Chemical and Energy revenues remained relatively flat, growing 1%. Pressure from reduced crude oil and natural gas prices, and continued softness in the industrial market slowed demand. Turning to Clinical and Diagnostics, revenues grew 1%, with solid demand for genomics products related to cancer applications and Mass spec for therapeutic monitoring offset by lower Pathology revenues. Geographically, economic recovery and government spending continued to drive growth in the Americas, up 6%. Asia excluding Japan grew 5%. We saw low single-digit growth from China, led by Life Science Research, Environmental and Food Testing. Europe was flat in the quarter. Continued strength in Eastern Europe and the Middle East was offset by softness in Western Europe. Japan declined 6% due to currency, but grew modestly on a local currency basis, primarily in Applied Markets. Turning to the business segments within LDA, Life Sciences and Diagnostics Group revenues grew 2%, while orders were up 3%. Excluding NMR, revenues were up 4% and orders were up 6%, with strong growth across LDG’s portfolio except pathology. Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5%, down 170 basis points from last year, but up 180 basis points from the previous quarter. Excluding the impact of NMR and FDA incremental expenses, LDG operating margin would have been 20% in Q4. Our Life Sciences team introduced a number of key new products in the past quarter. The 1290 Infinity II LC System sets a new benchmark in analytical, instrument and laboratory efficiency. OpenLAB CDS, Chromatography Data System, will fully support 1290 Infinity II LC System and provides one of the most comprehensive software control systems in the industry. We introduced ClearSeq AML, which is the first in line of NextGen sequencing panels developed for cancer research. And our new family of Sure Select Focused Exome products provides the most comprehensive and high performance NGS solution for post natal research on high throughput and benchtop sequencers. Turning to the chemical analysis group, revenues grew 5% while orders were up 8%. Operating margin for the quarter was strong at 24.5% flat a year ago and up 120 basis points from Q3. Our chemical analysis team also had a number of key new product introductions, including a new 7010 Triple Quad GCMS and 7200 GC/Q - TOF which expands pesticide screening beyond the capabilities of any other GC/Q - TOF System. We strengthened our industry-leading atomic Spectroscopy portfolio with the launch of the Agilent’s 5100 ICP-OES. This sets a new standard for optical emission spectroscopy and has been extremely well received by the market. Among its many innovations, analysis can be run 55% faster using 50% less gas per sample than competitive systems. In addition, the design changes have led to a 20 percentage point gross margin improvement over the previous product. As we launched the new Agilent and enter the new fiscal year, we have free focus areas for the company. Grow organically at the high-end of the market, aggressively expand operating margins, deploy capital for long-term shareholder value. First, we will focus on sustaining share growth within the core analytical lab. We will continue to bring innovative new offerings to the marketplace and expand our lab-wide services and consumables with a truly differentiated customer experience. We will leverage this strength in Analytical Lab to drive growth in the fast-growing genomics, clinical research and diagnostics markets. Second, we will focus on aggressively growing our adjusted operating margins with our portfolio and order fulfillment transformation programs. We will leverage SG&A and R&D investments, and reduce cost dis-synergies resulting from the separation of Keysight. Keep in mind that fiscal 2015 is a transition year for Agilent. Year one cost dis-synergies are the highest following the company separation. And NMR and FDA remediation work will continue to weigh on our results. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I have the highest confidence in our ability to meet Agilent’s long-term operating goals. Third, we will deploy capital for long-term shareholder value with expected return of $500 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2015. This includes a combination of cash dividends, approximately $135 million in opportunistic share buybacks. Turning to guidance, Agilent’s revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 are expected to range from $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion or 2.2% reported growth or 4.9% core growth at the midpoint. We expect first quarter earnings per share from $0.39 to $0.43. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range from $4.12 billion to $4.18 billion and earnings per share from $1.68 to $1.78. Thank you for being on the call. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent’s financial results and guidance. Thank you, Mike and hello, everyone. Bill and Mike have already covered Q4 orders, revenues and EPS. I will add that LDA’s 20.4% operating margin is in line with our volume-adjusted midpoint guidance. Also, please note that we spent an incremental $9 million in Q4 to address the FDA warning letter. Without this expense and assuming we had already exited the NMR related business, therefore saving $15 million on an annualized basis, LDA’s Q4 operating margin would be about 22%. Finally, we redeemed $500 million of debt in Q4 and generated $166 million in operating cash flow. This is lower than traditional for three main reasons. First, we paid $80 million for the redemption of the 2017 notes and also prepaid the current interest on the note. Second, pre-separation expenses amounted to $70 million. Third, we paid $41 million in taxes related to the spin. Also note, that we booked mostly non-cash charges related to the exit of the NMR-related business of $68 million. I’ll now turn to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. Our fiscal year ‘15 revenue guidance of $4.12 billion to $4.18 billion assumes the economy will pick up moderately in the second half of our fiscal year. At midpoint, our year-over-year growth will be 2.5% on a reported basis but 4.9% on a core basis, the difference due to currency. We project fiscal year ‘15 EPS to range from $1.68 to $1.78 with a midpoint of a $1.73 as per our October 17 guidance. As you update yours model for fiscal year ‘15, please consider the following, First, annual salary increases will be less effective December 1, 2014. Second, stock-based compensation would be about $65 million. As we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense would be about $26 million. Third, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth, net interest expense is forecasted at $63 million and other income at $29 million. About $26 million of other income comes from services billed to Keysights, $12 million for IT services in the first half and $14 million for ongoing rental income. And as we have previously communicated, the corresponding expenses are reflected in operating profit. So you will need to increase the reported operating profit with the value of those services billed to Keysight if you want to make year-over-year comparison of our operating profit. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $500 million in capital to shareholders, including $135 million in dividends and $365 million in opportunistic buybacks. The buybacks will occur from time to time on the open market with consideration given to our stock price. Seventh, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed diluted share count of 340 million shares. But we could achieve lower diluted share count of about 335 million shares, would we execute the buyback program in full. Eight, we expect operating cash flow of $600 million and capital expenditures of $120 million. The operating cash flow reflects post separation expenses of $50 million and separation related taxes of $40 million, both will be pro forma. Finally, moving to the guidance for fourth quarter, we expect Q1 revenues of $1.02 billion -- of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion and EPS of $0.39 to $0.43. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% year-over-year, or 4.9% on a core basis, the difference again, as a result of currency. As customary, Q1 EPS is still negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. Hi. This is   filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. It appears as though that China pressures haven’t completely subsided despite the low single-digit growth in the quarter. From your commentary, it sounds like it outpaced your expectations, but you sounded very positive on the spending environment in China in the quarter. Can you talk about what are you seeing in the marketplace, as well as what relative growth from China is baked into your current 2015 guidance? Brian, this is Mike. I will field the question on China. So, I guess, I think your read through in the commentary is correct. We saw low single-digit revenue growth, but we are encouraged by the overall strength of the order performance in the quarter with 7%, 8% order growth for the quarter. And what we saw happening in China was a return to levels of improved, albeit still subdued government spending, which fueled our growth in life sciences research, environmental testing and food businesses. Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe one high-level question. So over the past few years you have invested pretty materially above your peer group in terms of R&D for the LDA segment. How should we assess the related return on investment looking forward and more specifically where do you expect to pick up share and at what pace? I know you mentioned in some presentations early in the year, you are beginning to leverage some of the R&D investments in 2015. At what point should we think about R&D starting to become maybe a lower percentage of sales? Thank you. Just a follow-up commentary and the question, again, this is Mike. Relative to the comments you saw in my narrative in my early comments, we talked about leveraging the investments we’ve made in R&D. In particular, we have invested quite heavily to build our portfolio out in the life sciences space, and we\\'ve also invested to build out a sales channel, focused on our life sciences’ customer base. So you would expect that we continue to be able to outgrow the market in these parts of the portfolio. In particular, I would tell you that we had real strong strength in our separations, our chromatography and mass spectrometry business in the fourth quarter across liquid separations, gas phase separations and the metals analysis side of the business, ICP-MS. So, I think those core product categories would continue to fuel above market growth and has been a recipient to a lot of our investments that we talked about earlier. Hey. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the leverage question. As we are thinking about operating margins, either Mike or Bill, can you maybe just talk about, give little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin leverage, particular on the order fulfillment and portfolio aspect and do you in fact expect SG&A leverage in ‘15 as well? Yeah. So, I think, this is Mike. There is three drivers behind the overall operating margin improvement and as you may have seen already, we committed to a three point operating margin improvement over the next three years, hitting 22% by 17%. And as we\\'ve also indicated, FY ‘15 is a significant transition year for us in terms of working all the synergies but also significant in terms of underlying improvement to the operating performance of the company. And the three key components of our margin improvement plan. One is the portfolio transformation that I highlighted earlier in my comments. And one example of that is the new ICP-OES, which through new product design and capability has a 20 point better gross margin position than its predecessor product. So you will continue to see us coming to market and driving, not only topline growth with improved offerings, but also a better margin structure just based on the inherent design and platform design of the product. The order fulfillment transformation program is still centered on what you saw at the March Analyst Meeting last year, where Henrik is driving overall consolidation of manufacturing sites and more importantly a drive towards lower cost of our supply chain, as we have moved our manufacturing into low-cost parts of the world, such as Penang, Malaysia where the next phase of that program is to start to move our material supply chain, which as you know, represents actually a higher element of cost of the manufacture products. And the third aspect of the plan is SG&A and R&D. R&D cost structure leverage and you will start to see in FY ‘15, particularly on the SG&A line, as we leverage that and it starts to decline as percent of overall revenue, again, adjusting for the synergies will absorb in year one. Okay. And in the comments you called out some of the pathology headwinds, can you maybe just talk a little bit about when you think those bottom out and how much of the headwind was impacting the quarter? If you don’t mind, I think I will pass this question over to Fred. I’m so sorry. I’m going to pass this over to Fred Strohmeier and Fred, the question was related -- the question was related to the pathology business. When did you see the headwinds perhaps turning on that business, Fred? Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think in pathology, we are seeing at the moment a flat revenue, closer if you look through the last two quarters and I think particularly in Q4, we have a tough compare in Europe. I think we are seeing a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe and due to healthcare reforms, lower investment and also consolidation of lapse and also in AsiA - Pacific, stricter regulatory controls. And internally as Mike already mentioned, we are seeing also some reflection of our FDA program on the revenues we are seeing in Q4. But we are optimistic that we are able to turn the situation around for next year. The companion diagnostic is doing quite well, so it’s growing nicely, OEM is on plan, OEM and other reagent partnership is on plan. And what we are hearing from our customers in the fields concerning on this and our products is pretty encouraging. Okay. And then lastly, you left M&A out of the capital deployment discussion, any reason you wouldn’t consider tuck-ins that became available? Yeah. Our focus really in FY ‘15 is really to launch the new Agilent Technologies, really go after some of the operational opportunities. We are improving I discussed earlier. And as you heard from Didier and myself, we do have a plan to return capital to the shareholders this year. Good afternoon. Thank you. A question for you on capital allocation. There was obviously a focus on shareholder returns, as it relates to repurchasing dividend but wondering if you can comment a little bit about your interest and appetite for M&A. if we look across the portfolio, there are some gaps. My view particularly in diagnostics and genomics where you theoretically deploy some investment dollars to round out your offering, so just curios, how are you thinking about M&A in the near to medium-term? I will go ahead and take those questions. So, as I mentioned earlier, we’ve made a sizeable bet in our Dako acquisition and we think it has a tremendous amount of promise working through some short-term operational challenges. So our focus right now for FY15 is not to pursue large M&A but really to focus on -- realize the potential of the acquisition we have made. Great. And then if I could just ask one question on the shorter-term basis regarding some of the regional trends. I think you mentioned some softness in, I think Europe. And then in food safety, I think it was the mid-single-digit growth rate. And curious on the latter item in particular, it seems like in China, the industry in general this quarter has seen a little bit of pressure, mostly tied to some reshuffling in the government, though hopefully be a transient issue. So I was just wondering if number one, you share that view on China, and then secondly in Europe, can you maybe give us a mark-to-market on how that trended at the end of the quarter? Thank you. Sure, Isaac. So let me make some comment first on China. Just back about six weeks ago from visit at China and how the opportunity to kind of see firsthand and draw my own conclusions on what’s happening in the marketplace, and I think a characterization is spot on in terms of there\\'s been a significant reshuffling of ministries within the food safety arena. And I think it\\'s a temporal slowdown that we’ve seen in this space. And as we pointed to an earlier call, this actually had a pretty significant pull down in terms of overall order growth rate. We did see in the fourth quarter some initial signs that we maybe transitioning to some higher levels of growth in the food space in China. I would caution it is still subdued but is trending in the right direction. So I think this is clearly an area of great interest in Chinese government, but they also want to make sure that they\\'re investing efficiently. And I think they had drawn the conclusion they had way too many ministries kind of overlapping one another in terms of jurisdictions. So they are getting themselves better organized, but I do believe you\\'ll start to see a return to growth and investment in the food space. I would also add that the prospects for investment in the environmental testing in life science research are also bullish longer-term in China. The pull-through on Europe is continued sluggish conditions in Western Europe. But as we report the number, our European business also includes what we call the idea or Eastern Europe part of the world as well as the Middle East. And despite some of the political noise that you see in terms of what\\'s going on in the Middle East, our business is holding up quite well there and has continued to be a area of strength for us. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Didier on the warning letter for Dako manufacturing with the $9 million this quarter, is that issue now behind you from a P&L perspective or should we look for some of that to carry over into 2015? No, we are planning in, in our guidance. We are including some further expenses throughout 2015, obviously from a lower -- going lower after Q1. But the expenses will be flat in Q1 and potential in the Q2 from the Q4 run rate that we have. Situation in Denmark is complicated. There have been quite a few warning letters more than us inside of Denmark. And as a result of that, we\\'ve had to source resources from other parts of Europe and even from the U.S. to help out on the mitigation. And so the expenses will continue into Q1. Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up, wondering if you can comment on manufacturing and how that factors into gross margin improvement? I guess if you look across next year to with what you have going on, how much of gross margin gain that you think you\\'ll see is expected to come from what you might consider fix for a particular issue, whether it would be NMR or Dako versus what you just come from more opportunities to become incrementally more efficient? Yes, it’s a great question. And this is Mike. And that’s why I pointed to three aspects of the programs under operating margin, the supply chain transformation which you’re referring to, the portfolio transformation and then our rationalization and leverage of SG&A and R&D investments. I think it\\'s probably legal spread across the three. It’s a little bit hard to quantify. Hi, good afternoon, guys. So can you just give a little sense on the order pacing? You talked a little bit about some late orders and such. And just give a sense for how if the NMR announcement also had any impact on any of the other legacy spectroscopy businesses? Hey, Ross, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. And to maybe address the last part of your question first. No impact at all on the other aspects of the portfolio growth rates from the NMR announcement. In fact, we had a really fantastic quarter in terms of topline order growth in our spectroscopy business fueled by introduction of the new products I mentioned to you earlier. In terms of the overall order flow through the quarter, we were actually quite pleased with how the quarter finished. Orders coming in higher than forecast, and so always bit hard to project exactly what your win loss ratios maybe in a particular deal situation, but obviously we are pleased with the win loss ratios where we’re higher than we had forecast. And new products were above targeted ramp rates. And then as I mentioned earlier, the China orders were solid at 8%. So I think there was a geographic dimension as well to our order flow. Great. And maybe if you guys could just give us sort of a first flush of where the pro forma balance sheet is now, obviously a number of moving parts in the quarter in terms of debt paid out and how think about the optimized kind of leverage ratio for this business? Well, right now, as I said in my comments that the leverage in the company is consistent with our present credit rating and we feel very comfortable with where we are between BBB and BBB+. And I will remind all of the investors in the last five years, we have returned 62% of our free cash through dividends and share repurchases. So the framework of where we are is I think very, very solid and we have a proven track record of tax effectively returning excess cash to our shareholders. Thanks. I was just hoping maybe because we didn’t get any pro forma balance sheet, et cetera. If you could just give us a sense of where kind of the net cash or the leverage is just on a rough dollar basis? Absolutely. So for Newedge loans, we have about a little bit over $2.2 billion in cash and $1,650 million in that. And as Bill mentioned, our adjusted leverage is about little over 2.1, 2.2 adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio. Yes, 80% of the cash is trapped overseas. We have about $400 million in the U.S. The rest is trapped overseas. Hi, thank you. I wanted to return to the diagnostics business for just a second. You guys have forecasted that you expect that market to grow 8% to 10%. This year you certainly didn’t get there. And obviously there are some issues happening, including the warning letter but also some things that are out of your control on a regulatory front and reimbursement front. What gives you the confidence that you can get back to that high-single-digit growth rate which I guess is kind of what it would take to get to the appropriate hurdle rates that you need on a Dako acquisition? Thank you. I think this is a very good question. I think first of all, I believe, we will get back to the goals by the promise we had made over the last couple of quarters to automate the pathology business, I think we are really good on the consumables piece, I think the automation will be key of it -- will be key, so Omnis will be one of the element. And we have seen a couple of really good responses in the meantime. One of the biggest regions just as an example in Denmark has picked Omnis as the prime diagnostic tool in order to cancel diagnostic, number one. Number two, I think we are also making really progress with our new products we have introduces like the SureFISH, which has been growing in this quarter about over 100% really significant. We have a couple of new products on the market like the ClearSeq AML, this is leukemia cancer diagnostic tool, which is looking at cancer variations and cancer research that is the new HER2 FISH-IQ on Omnis available in the meantime, which allows another set of cancer diagnostic test. So from the product perspective, I think, we are fueling the pipeline in order to grow the business overtime. Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question for Didier. When did those transitional services for Keysight and how exactly do they wind down post 2015? So the IT services will wind down by the end of -- before the end of our fiscal year -- first half of fiscal year ’15, so by April. And then the rental services, those are about $15 million and those are ongoing. And by the way, Keysight, we are also buying from Keysight an equivalent of the $15 million also of rental services. I’ll remind you the way we want about splitting our real estate is more less balance, one of the two companies ended up being the landlord and in each side there was one of the two companies ended up being the landlord and subleasing some of the space to the other company if needed. And the two things offset each other will be receiving of about $15 million of rental income and we’ll pay about $15 million of rental expense to Keysight. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if you could build on, some of the commentary that you made here on the call, regarding some of the new product launch traction? Could you give us a sense in fiscal ’15, not necessarily byproduct, but maybe with the focus on geographies or customer types, where future product launches will be targeted most directly? Yes. Sure, Steve. So this is Mike. I’ll provide some color on some of the instrumentation around our separations and mass spectrometry offerings, and then, Fred, I’d ask you to jump in and talk little bit about some of the diagnostics and genomics products that come out. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in our core liquid chromatography, our leading platform the 1290 was replaced by an even stronger platform the 1290 Infinity II series. This allows the capture opportunities in Pharma, Biotech and across the implied markets space. So this is a broad-based tool that will go across all of our key end markets. The GC Triple Quad, the GC/Q - TOF, the mass spectrometry products that discussed are heavily focused towards food safety, pesticide analysis, environmental testing, but also increasing adoption in the Life Sciences Research arena as well. And then, finally, the new ICP-OES is targeted toward the Environmental, Pharma and Material Science space and in terms of -- that would be in terms of the end market usage. Obviously, we’re encouraged by what we saw as an uptick in growth in China because these products will play very strongly into this geography, as well as replace the market in the U.S. and Europe. And Fred, maybe some additional comments on the LDG side? Yeah. Maybe, I just made a couple of comments on the new products on the pathology side. I think, just what I want to mention is, once we are improving the situation around the FDA letter, that by itself will stimulate some further growth, number one. Number two, I believe it is very important that we are launching products in where we are using the synergy with other things we have in our product line, which are the genomics product. But I think putting those things in a meaningful way together that we’re creating work flows which make a difference to the customer is one of the themes for next year. But I think a couple of those things we have started launching a new PCR, qPCR instrumentation, which will be in this market. We have launched some editing tools of synthetic biology or genome editing tools for synthetic biology the CRISPR/Cas solution, which come to the markets and is introduced to the market, which will pick up next year. Thanks. Very helpful. And then one for Didier on currency. Historically, the company has had a pretty effective natural hedge, so the translation from the topline into the P&L was relatively muted. Is that still true for new Agilent? And if not, are there any currencies that we should look out for as potentially having an impact on margins? Thanks so much. Yeah. It is still true. We have only one of the smaller flow through I would say of longer peer group, about -- with the current mix about 20% to 25%, so for reduction of a dollar in the topline $0.20 to $0.25 impact on the bottomline. It is not zero, even though we are structurally heads because we have a presence, well right presence. And we also have our financial hedging, but the financial hedging doesn’t provide one full year. So it really covers 100% of the coming quarter and then 75%, 50%, 25%. But overall, we believe, we are properly hedged knowing that the hedges, the financial hedges cannot really cover you forever. And then in terms of the mix, it’s clearly -- our flow through is even smaller in Europe for example where we have a strong presence with only 10% versus Japan where we have less of the presence. And therefore, an impact on the topline will not be totally offset by an impact to OpEx and cost of sales. So there is a mix difference, but on the present mix, it\\'s about 20% to 25% flow through. Good morning. As I do the back out on the capital redeployment, you\\'re talking maybe 5 million decline in shares outstanding, which I think implies $165 million share comp number. Is that share comp number a little high because of the spin? And what should that share comp number be? The math is a little bit complicated, but the speed is pretty much has no impact on our share count. What you have to consider every year is that the share count evolves because of grants of RSUs or long-term performance plans or exercise of stock options or the employee stock purchase plan. It also changes with the changes in valuation of our stock price or our TSR versus our peer group. And then we do buyback shares, so it’s a little bit complicated but no impact from the split. Didier earlier in the call, you had mentioned that you kind of were talking about a 22% pro forma operating margin net-net. Do you think you’ll be talking 22% and higher same discussion as FY ‘15 rolls out? So no -- Mike mentioned where we are extremely committed to improving our operating margins to 23% by 2017. But this is three years plan. Q4’s operating margin is always stronger because it’s where we have to realize the highest volume and the number that I have provided excluded the impact of NMR. I assume the NMR is exited and as Mike mentioned, we want to exit NMR until the end of 2015 and also it’s assumed it’s basically backed out the expenses related to addressing the FDA issues. And as we have also talked, we all spend money in 2015 to continue to spend money to address those issues. And last Mike, what did you see or do at chemical analysis that you think you can do with the rest of Agilent? Thanks Paul. Appreciate the question. And I think its really -- Bill and I have talked about this as well, which is to really take a view of the focus bets that you are going to make, be very selective on the bets you make. And I try to highlight a few of those earlier. And then drive an operational excellence around those focused bets and then couple that with what we’ve done historically which was meaningful M&A in the variant deal, for example. But I really think it’s all about picking right focus bets getting the organization aligned on those focus areas then drive in operational excellence around the activities. Hi Bill. Hi Mike. Hi Didier. Let me just start with the question on the academic markets. It seems like you are seeing some improvement there for the second quarter interval. I was wondering if you could comment if you’re seeing the funds flow in the second half of the year, the calendar year? And you do have unlike others in the industry, you have had the month of October in your quarter. So I am wondering if it is too early to speculate on a possible year end budget flush? Yeah, this is Mike. I’ll jump in with my perspective then Fred, feel free to add your view as well. But I think the answer to your question, Miro, I think it’s too early to call a year end budget flush, if you will. We were encouraged by the results but keep in mind the U.S. government closes off at September a lot of their spending. And we also had a closing of our own sales cycle at the end of October, which sometimes doesn\\'t always mimic the spending patterns of our customers. So while encouraged, I think it’s too early to call a significant global recovery here in this segment. And Fred, I don’t know what you are hearing from your field teams. Yeah. Our field team is pretty consistent with what I\\'m hearing. I think academia and government markets remain soft even so we are seeing a gradual improvement. And the result we are seeing at the moment are impacted predominantly by NMR as such because this is going mainly through the academia and government market, we see a funding growth in China as Mike pointed out the results are showing that. So this is certainly impacting the growth in next year. We see a stable funding in SAPK. Japan is weak and maybe remains weak given in all of the missing stimulus from last year. You are seeing demand in HPLC, GC-MS and LCMS, what’s really hard to sub checks and this is probably driving some of the growths next year, cell biology, stem cell research and next generation sequencing. These are areas which will drive some of the growth. NaH is spending about plus 2%. This year, hopefully, we see something like that next year as well. Europe already, we heard about it, very tight. And if you look to the distribution of the countries, it’s a completely mixed bag. China reorganizing even so, I talked about the growth is reorganizing the academia of the Chinese Academy of Science, which certainly also will have some impact on the spending pattern and we talked about Japan already. Okay. Thank you. And secondly on the gross margin it did decline slightly year-over-year, I was wondering if you could help us understand the puts and takes? And for the neoadjuvant going forward, despite the dys-synergies that you have this coming year, can you drive margin, gross margin expansion in ‘15? Didier, why don’t I make some initial comments and then you can build on it. So if you look our year-on-year gross margin, I believe the FDA remediation work is part of our cost to sales number. I also would point to a change in our overall business model. We haven’t talked about in this call yet. But with the creation of the CrossLab services, consumer informatics group, you are going to hear me talk a lot more about what’s going on across the enterprise in our laboratories and our services business is becoming an increasingly larger part of the company. It’s got a very nice operating margin story. But as the mix changes, it does have a different gross margin structure relative to instrument business. So when you look at just at the gross margin line, you are going to see a mix effect of the increasing portion of our business coming from services. Didier, I don’t know if there is something else you would add to that? Yeah. I mean, in terms of the gross margin, I will say, I mean, the other negatives you mentioned are the dis-synergies and as we already talked about the impact of currency on a year-over-year basis. And so that would be the main reasons why on a gross margin bases, on an adjusted operating margin basis, we are going to see some slight improvement year-over-year even with all those negative, all those headwinds. But on the gross margin, it’s going to be slightly down year-over-year. Yeah. I don’t know whether I really clearly answered the other part of your question. This is Mike again, which is we do see, we have the ability to improve our overall gross margins and move forward because obviously we are going to get the FDA remediation work behind us. We talked earlier about the new products coming out and as well as our supply chain transformation. So we do believe that we can improve our overall gross margins, but we are also working through some one-time transition challenges around NMR, the FDA industry, the separation, if you will to synergies. Currency has a particularly big impact on gross margins because it’s offset by the lower operating expenses. So when I said, $400 million, you have net-net $20 million to $25 million impact to the bottom line. The impact to the gross margin is more significant and then this offset in OpEx. Yes. Good afternoon. Mike, could you just talk for a minute or two about the petrochem energy chemical markets? I think you mentioned they were up 1% in the quarter and quite frankly all year, they’ve been low single-digit. But maybe, what\\'s your assessment there as we move into ’15, are we in early innings of our commodity driven down cycle there in demand, or were orders and orders better in the fourth quarter here heading into ‘15? Yeah. Richard, thanks for the question. And this has been a -- I have to say, a segment of the market has been quite curious for me over the last several quarters because at the very macro level, you would expect to have seen stronger business here as you think about particularly United States where you’ve had lower feedstock cost coming down and some of our major customers actually taking about investment in the plant and infrastructure and new capacity in the U.S. So, I think what we saw in this most recent fiscal year, and a continuation of the quarter was continued challenges in industrial side of the Chinese economy where we haven\\'t seen as much capacity been out of that we had seen in prior quarters. I believe the real wild card and this is why I think we’ll start to see some moderate return to growth in FY ‘15 in this segment is the replacement market in the private sector particularly in the U.S. The industry outside of the exploration side is actually finding itself much more profitable, the age of the assets and equipment has really moved up over the last several years. So we think that the combination of the aged assets plus the lot of our customers, who are going to need to move on to new data system because of the obsolescent by Microsoft of several of their core operating systems. I think this would point to an improved replacement market in FY ‘15 albeit I said it’s been much slower to develop than I had anticipated. Okay. All right. And when I look at the CAG business and LDG business heading into ‘15 and I know the core growth is kind of -- at the midpoint is 4.9%, call it 5%. Is the LDG business expected to grow above that number and CAG kind of low single digits. So how do you see the mix by end market playing to that 5% core growth number? Richard, a great question. I think you really picked up the insights we were trying to share on the call today which was the strength of the underlying core business you strip out such as the business such as NMR. So Fred and I haven’t compared exact growth rate assumptions between the two segments. But I would say in general, we’d expect both to enjoy growth. But we’d expect to see high levels of growth in the life sciences side of the house just given what we seem to be a stronger backdrop of pharma, biopharma, some government spending and just our overall share position in those segments. And again also keep in mind that part of the story here isn’t just instruments and technology, part of the story here is the services business. And in fact, after Fred makes a few comments, I’ll invite Mark, you’re not going to get away from this call without making some comments on your first call to talk about what’s going on the pharma space, life sciences relative to the services business. So Fred, if you would, maybe just add a little bit additional color. Yeah. I mean, the pharma industry is only at the moment growing in the area of around 3% to 5%. I mean we are seeing a lot of instrument refresh as Mike explained it out. That’s particular in pharma, a huge opportunity for services and consumables. The most growing segment within that is at the moment the biological -- biologics, which is growing about 18% and the overall size is about 20% of the entire pharmaceutical market. I think we are well-positioned with all products. Mike has just highlighted before our core products in LC, LC MS. So I think this is fueling the growth. The refresh in this business I think it’s not as homogeneous as ours. I mean, Americas has a difficult compare because we had a good business last year. I think Europe is picking up at this point in time also on generics. So overall, I think this is one of the drivers and academy and government you talked about before, I think this is also certainly slightly picking up. So from that perspective, this should fuel across the next year. And Mark, just closing off this question, just your view on what\\'s going on in the services side in pharma in particular? Sure, Mike. And as you alluded to, I think we see both the areas across CAG and LDK being strong, but in the pharma area in particular continued strong demand for our enterprise services and those particularly targeted at helping customers with operational efficiencies. And to that end also, if you add the consumables side of it too, a continued focus on our biocolumns and sample prep area that I think heading into next year we will continue to service well. Thanks. Does the op profit contribution of flow through today to Agilent’s P&L, is it north of 20% on the services side? I don’t know whether we’ve disclosed the actual operating percentages externally, but I would just say we’re in the range of our instrument business. So it’s not a drag on company performance. You want to see us grow our business here. Okay. And then I am sorry one last question, the NMR business year-over-year in the fourth quarter, was there a revenue delta that was meaningful fourth quarter of \\'14 versus fourth quarter of \\'13? On a year-over-year basis, it’s about -- there a 22% reduction in revenue for the full year and on the quarterly basis, it was 49%. Hi. Good afternoon. It’s Rafael in for Derik and thanks for the questions. Just first on 2015 guidance, just wondering what the expectation for growth is by geography on the Americas, Europe, AsiA - Pac and China as well? Thanks. Rafael, this is Mike. Just make a few comments. I think you first of all saw in Didier’s narrative, he talked about an overall gradually improving economic environment in the second half of ’15, that’s sort of the backdrop behind my comments. What I’m just going to share with you at this general trend, I wouldn’t want to be able to present myself with being able to predict exactly the growth rates in every of the geographic markets. But the backdrop of our forecast beyond this gradually improving second half environment in ‘15 is we see an improving U.S., China and India, which we’ve not talked about today, continued weakness in Western Europe, Brazil and Japan. So what\\'s really driving this is the overall continuation of the improvements in the U.S., China and India marketplace. Okay. I appreciate that color. And just after exiting the NMR business, how should we think about the company\\'s portfolio of review strategy and whether the company\\'s planning on exiting on the other product lines in the near-term just thinking, I guess bigger picture of how content the company is with its existing portfolio? Thanks. Sure. Great question. As Paul asked me earlier, when we talked about the experience I had, on the chemical analysis group was, we always constantly reviewed where our portfolio was, was it meeting expectations, did we see a path for to a viable business. So that discipline that we’ve had in the prior years in the chemical analysis business that will be carried forward with the new Agilent. And I think you saw one example of that with our decision around NMR, which we really didn\\'t see a path forward to a viable attractive business for Agilent. I’m very satisfied and happy with the portfolio we have. But what I will commit to is a continued rigorous ongoing review of our portfolio relative to our expectations. Hi. Good afternoon. Just in terms of the NMR exit, can you frame that in terms of the duration of the topline impact and then also the cost too coming out of that business? The topline from 2015 will not be fundamentally much lower than really what we\\'ve seen in 2014 because we do have a big backlog, not just NMR business, but also the OEM business that we exited one year ago, we would say, we still have backlog to flush for big part of 2015. And then, the bottomline impact we have indicated that it is on an annualized basis its about $15 million, next year it will be about $10 million opening profit improvements because of the exit and $15 million in 2016. And then, in terms of the topline in 2016, are you -- and maybe even ’17, are you still going to be delivering orders there or? No, no. We are -- we will be done in 2015 with flushing the backlog and we are not taking any order. That’s an important build to Didier’s comments. We will retain the profitable NMR service business, both in terms of -- making sure we have the business continuity for our customers, as well as an attractive business segment for us as well. Yes. Good afternoon. Didier, just one question for you, in terms of the free cash flow guidance implies about $480 million of free cash flow? I think, going back to the Analyst Day, you kind of pointed to more like a $620 million number? Can you just walk us through what the factors are there in terms of the delta in the free cash flow outlook? Yeah. So, the $600 million of opening cash flow that we are projecting is after paying about $50 million of post-separation expenses and also $40 million of taxes related to the separation. So there is $90 million which will be pro forma, but there will be cash outlays in 2015. So really on the sustainable basis, you are talking $690 million. Yeah. Because it was excluding the one-time items, really it was -- the sustainable cash flow contributions and we talked about 15% of revenues on an ongoing basis of three years period, excluding those one-time separation related items. They are both separation related items. Okay. And one more on the NMR business, would you -- can you quantify the operating loss incurred from that business in ’14 for us? Well, what happens is it will be misleading because it includes a lot of costs now basically absorbed from the share allocated from the shared services, but what we have stated this -- the exit will basically improve operating profit by $10 million next year and $15 million in 2016. Thank you, Patrick. And thank you everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR and we\\'d like to wish you all a good day. Thank you. Ronald S. Nersesian - Executive Vice President, Chief Executive Officer of Electronic Measurement Group and President of Electronic Measurement Group Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Inc. Fiscal Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note, today\\'s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Karen, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s Third Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2014. With me are: Bill Sullivan, Agilent President and CEO; Ron Nersesian, Keysight President and CEO; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier\\'s comments will be the Presidents of Agilent\\'s Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets, or LDA, businesses, Mike McMullen and Fred Strohmeier. Also joining from Keysight will be Neil Dougherty, CFO; and Guy Séné, Senior Vice President of Measurement Solutions and Worldwide Sales. You can find the press release and information to supplement today\\'s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an investor presentation, along with revenue breakouts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent\\'s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today\\'s comments by Bill, Ron and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company and the separation of the Electronic Measurement business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Lastly, we expect this to be the final quarter in which we conduct a joint conference call for both Agilent and Keysight. We expect the company\\'s separation to be finalized in early November, after which Keysight will operate and report as an independent company. And now I\\'d like to turn the call over to Bill. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported third quarter revenues of $1.77 billion, an increase of 7% versus last year and above the high end of guidance. Orders of $1.74 billion were up 9% over a year ago. Adjusted earnings of $0.78 per share also exceeded the high end of guidance and increased 15% over last year. Operating margin was 19.2%, up 90 basis points from the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Both Keysight and LDA delivered on revenue and earnings commitments. In most end markets, we saw continued improvement and good order growth across both businesses. Our work to split the company continues to go very well. On August 1, Keysight began operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. We expect the separation of the company to be completed by early November as planned. Today, I will share performance highlights of LDA, or the life science, diagnostics and applied market businesses that comprise Agilent moving forward. Following my remarks, Ron will share performance highlights for Keysight. Finally, Didier will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\\'s overall financial results, as well as our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Turning to LDA. Third quarter revenues came in at $1.01 billion, up 6% over a year ago or 5% on a core basis. Orders grew 10% to $1.02 billion or 9% on a core basis. Operating margin was 19%, up 50 basis points from last year. In our Diagnostics and Clinical markets, revenue grew 6%, with strength in array CGH, target enrichment, as well as demand for pathology products in the U.S. and Europe. Revenue from analytical lab markets also grew 6% in Q3. We were pleased with the growth we saw across our instruments, services and consumables portfolio fueled by new offerings to the marketplace. Within the Life Science and Applied markets that make up Analytical Laboratories, Pharma/Biotech was up 8%, led by midsized and specialized Pharma customers. Life Sciences Research was up 4%, posting the best year-over-year growth in 2 years. Results were driven by increased government spending on capital equipment in the U.S. and Europe. Government spending also was the catalyst behind 16% growth in Environmental and 12% growth in Forensics. In Food, revenues were up 4% over last year as results in the U.S. and Europe were offset by the impact of the FDA restructuring in China. Chemical and Energy revenues were relatively flat, growing 1%, largely due to softer demand from China versus a year ago. Geographically, economic recovery and government funding drove growth in the Americas and Europe, up 6% and 8%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 4%. China continues to work through government agency reorganizations, which is resulting in a longer approval cycle. Turning to the business segments within LDA. Life Science and Diagnostics Group\\'s revenue grew 5%. Orders grew 11%, with broad strength across LDG products. Operating margin was almost 16%, down slightly from last year and up 260 basis points from last quarter. LDG introduced a number of new products in the quarter. One highlight was the 6495 LC Triple Quad Mass Spectrometer which provides higher sensitivity, robustness and reliability. Another highlight was the introduction of the IQFISH work flow for bone marrow and custom FISH service through Sure Design. Both FISH products provide high-quality results with significantly shorter turnaround times -- from 16 hours to 2.5 hours in the case of the IQFISH. LDG also signed a development and commercialization agreement with Merck & Co. for a companion diagnostics device, using Dako\\'s IHC solutions with Merck & Co.\\'s anti-PD-L1 cancer drug. In the Chemical Analysis Group, revenues and orders increased 8%. Operating margin was over 23%, up 180 basis points from a year ago. CAG announced the 5100 ICP-OES in July. The new product runs analyses 55% faster and uses 50% less gas per sample than competitive systems. The 5100 is suited to applications in Environmental, Food, Energy and Pharmaceutical markets. CAG\\'s recently introduced 7010 GC Triple-Quad Mass Spectrometer, targeted for the Food Safety market, lowers costs and improves ease of use compared to current high-resolution mass spec systems. The 7010 significantly strengthens Agilent\\'s market position with a range of pricing options, performance and productivity benefits. In July, the Cary 700 Universal Spectrophotometer was named a 2014 R&D 100 Award winner. The award recognizes the 100 most technically significant products introduced in the marketplace over the past year. This award marks the third consecutive year Agilent\\'s spectrophotometers have been recognized as R&D 100 Award winners. In 2013, the Agilent 8800 Triple Quad ICP-MS won the award and the Agilent 4100 Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrophotometer won in 2012. These awards demonstrate the benefit of our investment in spectroscopy. Looking forward to Q4, we expect mid single-digit growth across LDA as we continue to build on our order momentum, gain traction with new products and drive manufacturing cost reduction. We remain committed to creating shareholder value through: increasing our organic growth rate by leveraging Agilent\\'s strength in the analytical lab into the fast-growing genomics and diagnostic markets; continuing to differentiate through best-in-class tools, workflow solutions and customer experience; and finally, expanding operating margins and return on invested capital consistent with our long-term operating model. Turning to guidance, LDA revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 are expected to be between $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion or 6.2% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 21.1%. For the full year, we expect LDA revenue in a range from $4.07 billion to $4.09 billion, with operating margins at the midpoint of 19%. Didier will provide additional details in his remarks. Thank you for being on the call. I will now turn it over to Ron to talk about Keysight and the Electronic Measurement business. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. I\\'m pleased to report that Keysight had a very good quarter and we continue to focus on returning to market growth rates while meeting operating margin expectations. Turning to our performance, I will start by highlighting 3 key headlines from Keysight\\'s third quarter. First, Q3 revenues came in at the top end of our guidance range and operating margins were above expectations. Second, our overall outlook and forecast for the second half remains unchanged despite potential disruption from geopolitical, macroeconomic and company-separation risks. And third as Bill mentioned, we began operating as Keysight Technologies on August 1 and remain on track to be fully separate from Agilent in November. Now let\\'s move to the specifics. Keysight revenues of $757 million increased 8% year-over-year while orders of $722 million were up 7%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95. Keysight continues to deliver solid profit margins, generating operating profit of $149 million for the quarter, which corresponds to an operating margin of 20%. Last quarter, we highlighted the operational separation of Keysight that occurred on August 1. This was a massive step that had the potential to impact the timing of customer shipments. In fact, some customers requested early deliveries to ensure no delays during our transition, and this moved some revenue from Q4 into Q3. As we have consistently noted throughout the year, we expected our Aerospace and Defense and Communications markets to grow in the second half. These markets were the drivers of Keysight\\'s Q3 growth, but strength in these markets were offset in the Industrial and Computer markets. Aerospace and Defense revenue grew 13% this quarter with strengths in both government and prime contractor business as well as regional strength in the Americas and Asia. Communications revenue grew 16% in Q3. Wireless basestation and component manufacturing were strong. However, handset manufacturing was weak as customer buying power and increased competition accelerated price erosion in that business. Industrial Computers and Semiconductor revenue was flat year-over-year. Continued strength in semiconductor end markets was offset by the softer computer business. On a regional basis, revenues grew year-over-year in all regions, with the exception of Japan. Europe grew 16% versus a soft compare last year; Asia Pacific excluding Japan, improved 11%, with positive growth across nearly all segments; the Americas grew 8%; while Japan declined 13% due to declines in government aerospace and defense spending. Overall, Keysight continues to invest in the transformation of our product portfolio with a focus on modular, software and certain wireless solutions. Aligned with this focus, in Q3, Keysight was awarded the Global Frost & Sullivan Award for Growth Excellence Leadership in the PXI instrumentation market. We also announced a strategic partnership to collaborate in early 5G research with China Mobile, the world\\'s largest mobile network operator, and we announced participation in the Korea 5G Forum. Keysight introduced new products in the quarter, including our modular Bit Error Rate Tester, which provides a new level of scalability and flexibility for the fast-paced, high-speed digital markets. In addition, in July, we began volume shipments of our PXI vector signal analyzer. It is the world\\'s fastest and most accurate microwave vector signal analyzer that significantly reduces test times across a wide range of applications and markets. As you know, Keysight began operating as a subsidiary of Agilent on August 1 and we expect to complete the spinoff in early November. Our focus throughout this journey is to make this significant transition as seamless as possible for our customers. Our successful results to date are due to the hard work of our employees, who are implementing a separation plan that includes working closely with thousands of customers to coordinate our shipments and delivery plans in this transition period. I am very pleased with their achievement so far. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are facing several headwinds in a handful of areas, most notably Russia. Our sales to Russia have represented 3% of Keysight\\'s total revenue. The volatile political environment, as well as new export restrictions on certain products, may halt growth in one of our fastest-growing regions. Despite the geopolitical, macroeconomic and company-separation risks, we are reiterating our second half and annual guidance. We expect the FY \\'14 revenues to be in the range of $2.91 billion to $2.95 billion which represents 2% core growth at the midpoint. We have tightened the range but the midpoint is the same as we have communicated last quarter. Similarly, our expectation for full year operating margin remains unchanged at 18.9% at the midpoint. This implies Q4 revenues are expected to be in the range of $740 million to $780 million with operating margins at the midpoint of 20.5%. Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, orders grew 9% year-over-year, revenues grew 7%, and our revenue of $1.766 billion operating margin of 19.2% and EPS of $0.78 were all higher than the high end of our guidance. Please note that Q3 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported in the slide deck posted on our website. This quarter, currency added about 0.6 percentage points to our year-over-year revenue growth and acquisitions had no material impact. We bought back $50 million of stock in Q3, redeemed $500 million of debt and generated $28 million in operating cash flow. This is lower than traditional for 3 main reasons: number one, we prepaid about $60 million of supplier invoices at the end of July as we will not make any payment in the early part of August; number two, we paid $29 million for the redemption of the 2015 notes and also prepaid the current interest on that note; and number three, pre-separation expenses amounted to over $60 million. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.81 billion to $1.85 billion and EPS of $0.87 to $0.91. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.5% and EPS, 10%. Our 21% projected operating margin at midpoint will be 180 basis points higher than Q3 fiscal year \\'14 and 60 basis points higher than Q4 of last year. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we\\'re also investing in key growth initiatives. We expect to generate about -- over $300 million of operating cash flow in Q4 and incur about $60 million of pre-separation costs. Now to the fiscal year 2014. The fiscal year \\'14 guidance at midpoint remains the same as previously communicated, but we are narrowing the range. We expect fiscal year \\'14 revenues to range from $6.99 billion to $7.03 billion and fiscal year \\'14 EPS to range from $3.04 to $3.08. Great. I just want to clarify, it\\'s unclear what your expectation for Russia is -- unclear to me what your expectation for Russia is in the Keysight guidance. Are you reiterating that you can deliver guidance even if Russia -- business in Russia halts? Or are you retreating the guidance while cautioning us that Russia could drive downside? We can deliver -- our plan is to deliver the guidance with the Russia halt. This quarter, we saw very good revenue growth in Russia and we saw negative order growth in Russia. But we have taken that into consideration in our guidance. Got it. And my follow-up question. In the Agilent business, you have a competitor which is exiting the gas chromatography market. Is there any way you can quantify what this means to your opportunity in that market, either from a revenue or a margin perspective? Agilent Technologies is a leader in gas chromatography, and we will do everything we can to support our existing customers and future customers as we go forward. Just a quick question. When you look at China in total, and maybe, Ron, I\\'m thinking more on the Key  side of the business. Could you just kind of speak to the tone in China and in Japan as well, just Asia in general, and how that looks over the next 3 to 6 months? Sure. First, I\\'ll start with China. We\\'ve seen hot basestation manufacturing orders as -- and we\\'ve also seen strong orders for components. On the handset side and handset manufacturing, there has been considerable price pressure and that market has undergone some real price erosion. But overall in China, our business looks pretty solid. We have seen some increases on export restrictions for China, as well as Russia, and that has affected our business a little bit. With regard to Japan, the government has not been funding any new programs that we\\'re aware of for satellites or defense work, and that has led to a continued soft environment. And just one thought is this -- as you know, Apple -- I know we don\\'t talk customers, but the last time there were some fairly significant share shift. It was attributed to Apple basically. And as they ramp up on the iPhone 6, can you -- is the test content into that automation and production run, which they want to start in September, is the test content considerably less than it was as they ramped up on the previous generation? Or has pricing eroded to a point where it does not have as significant of an impact on the industry in general? Okay. And then just -- well, let me just ask, the PXI VSA that you just started shipping, that is a bench top instrument. No, it\\'s a PXI modular instrument that could be married with other instruments in a modular form factor. It could be used on the bench or it could be used in production. I guess, Ron, your 4Q op margin guidance for Keysight of 20.5% is above the high end of your market growth model that you laid out at the Analyst Day, and I\\'m wondering if you could discuss what dynamics are driving this upside. And I assume mix is helping and then can you talk about the sustainability of this elevated margin? Sure. Well overall, first of all, we had predicted 8% growth in the second half. We delivered 8% in Q3 and if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it\\'s 8% in Q4. We did have very high incrementals above the middle of our guidance during this last quarter, but we do need to still invest in this multiyear transformation to get our product line growing at market and then eventually above market. But the guidance that we just gave right now factors everything in place. Don\\'t forget Q4 is seasonally a strong quarter which basically when you have a significant amount of fixed costs drives higher margins. Great, and then just shifting gears to basestation strength that you talked about in your prepared remarks. Can you talk about that on a geographic basis, and when we look at LTE and TD LTE markets in China, I\\'m curious how this market is faring relative to expectations and the kind of visibility or duration that you\\'re expecting from these deployments. Sure. Well, first of all, the basestation build that is obviously 4G and TD LTE for China, et cetera, and FTE  for the rest of the world. But we see players in Europe and in Asia that are doing this. So when you look at some of the major players that are centered out of Europe, we see strength and then we also see strength in China in Asia in the basestation market. Well, the only other thing I could add on is the fact that especially the whole -- the 3 operators in China are now starting to deploy 4G. So that\\'s the trend that is going to be here for probably a few years, but with ups and downs at the capacity we\\'ll have to build. Bill, I wanted to start with the LDA side. It looks like the order growth in the core business there was really solid, and wanted to kind of get a little bit more color from you on the product specifics there. It really seems like you guys are taking at least a little bit of market share from your competitors just given their growth rates versus yours. It\\'ll be helpful to see a little bit of color on where you think you\\'re doing the best. Yes, I\\'ll give an overview comment and then turn it over to Mike and Fred to comment in their respective businesses. But my first warning is, I\\'ve always had, is you really have to look at the overall performance of the marketplace as a rolling 4 quarters, and again, we\\'re very happy with the performance in Q3. I\\'m particularly pleased with the rebound from Fred\\'s business from last quarter. I mean, if there is anything in the last quarter that we had is that the growth in revenue in the Life Science side was below expectations. And so that\\'s really the story from my mind is that we\\'ve got great order momentum across all of Fred\\'s product lines going forward, and I\\'ll have him comment on that. And of course, Mike\\'s business just continues to roll along. I mean, we are the leader in the applied side of the market. We have a lot of competition because people see that but his team is just doing an outstanding job of holding and if not growing position. But I\\'ll turn it over to Fred, and I\\'m going to flip the order, put -- go to Fred, because it really is the biggest change sequentially, and then turn it over to Mike. Thanks, Bill. I think we are very pleased with the results we\\'re seeing from all the platforms, I mean, almost across the board, starting on the top, I mean, the LC/MS growth rebounded quite significantly over the last 4 to 5 months after a pretty difficult fiscal year \\'13. And so we are confident that the new products are really pushing our business forward, starting with the new triple quad which we have introduced at ASMS. And also the single quad which we introduced is keeping up very well against the competition, by the way, really nice growth there. Secondly, we are seeing informatics as a key element. And as we have talked several times about it, increased investments there, informatics is really growing along with that and is pulling instrumentation with it. And third piece is in the classic instrumentation piece is the LCs, which are growing nicely as well from a revenue perspective. And turning to the pieces actually Mike owns but assigned to the Life Science business. Consumables and services were strong as well. So turning over to the genomics and diagnostics space, we saw really significant growth in the genomics space, predominantly driven by the target enrichment of the assembly preparation  for next-generation sequencing. We saw solid growth in the space of pathology, mainly driven by the IQFISH with a few things we have introduced there, which are real significant advantage from a customer\\'s perspective. And we also saw the companion diagnostic rolling at the rate we were expecting. And finally, the companion diagnostic. Also the contract with Merck, they have signed, but we are seeing an increasing demand on companion diagnostic, which is in line with what we are seeing in the market in general. That\\'s helpful. And just maybe one other if I may. On China, you guys mentioned some of the changes with the SFDA. And now that, that\\'s behind us, can you maybe give us a sense of what\\'s baked into your outlook for China both in LDA, as well as EMG for the balance of the year? I\\'m going to turn it back to Mike, if you don\\'t mind, to answer the first question, because again, he\\'s got a great story on the applied side from a market perspective. And then our China business for LDA was flat. Again, Asia was up 4%, China down -- or Japan down a little bit, China, flat. And so we obviously had a very strong non-China Asia performance. I\\'m going to have Mike talk a little about his products and then comment on China because a lot of his is in China. But our China business was flat for LDA in the context of overall strong Asia that was up 4%. Obviously, China dominates that performance. And then after Mike answers, I\\'ll have it turn it over to Ron to talk about China specifically for Keysight. Thanks, Isaac, for the earlier question. So first of all building on Fred\\'s commentary about the drivers for a quarter which we\\'re very pleased with in terms of both the revenue and the incoming order rate, we saw this strong services and consumables performance in this CAG segment space for Q3. But we\\'re also seeing the growth being driven by the new product introductions we have been making over the last several quarters and the past year or so, from our introductions in the mass spectrometry area, on GC/MS and ICP-MS, and as you saw in the earnings call, we highlighted that we got one other what I believe to be an award-winning product in the spectroscopy area. So we saw strong growth in the mass spectrometry business both gas space and inorganic side, as well as our base of spectroscopy business. So the innovative products we\\'re bringing to market are actually driving growth, and this was in an environment where we had a challenged market situation in China. So I think it\\'s fairly well publicized. The food ministries, reorganizations are underway. I think it\\'s taking longer for those to settle out and for them to get organized and really get the procurement side going in terms of the new purchases. So we were delighted with the results of these type of growth rates and in a market, as Bill described, it was relatively flat in China. Ron? As far as China, our revenue growth was a little bit over 20% for the quarter, but our order growth was 5%. Mike, just back on that same question. Could you give us a sense to how orders performed in China in the period if there was any delta between the revenue experience and the order experience? Yes, thanks, Brandon, for the question. So slightly better view, about 2% order growth in Q3. And I will again reemphasize, I think the long-term growth prospects in China remain strong. And we see some of these challenges we\\'re seeing right now in the food market as just really, kind of a temporal kind of thing as they get their agencies organized, but a slightly better view on the order growth rate, but I\\'ll also say that we finished the quarter very strong in China. And then one more for Bill or Didier. Is there an opportunity for share repurchase activity to accelerate for LDA, post-spin here going forward? Our stated strategy to date as we had talked about is to, first of all, ensure that we keep our bondholders whole and reduce the debt to ensure that we can maintain our investment grade. We\\'re also committed to making a dividend payment of $130 million, which we believe will be roughly the same percentage dividend as what it was before under Agilent. Stating that, the new Agilent is very, very profitable and has very high cash flow. Our priority continues to be to look on ways to invest in the business. But I\\'ve been very clear that we have to digest a lot with the separation, the acquisitions that we have made, and we will continue to work with the Board of Directors to figure out the best way to return cash back to our shareholders. Maybe, Ron, starting on the sort of basestation and more so focused on the U.S. business. It seemed like a number of peers called out weakness at a number of the large carriers here. Could you just maybe talk about sort of what you\\'ve seen from the demand base from those folks and maybe how your business differs from some of the others where they\\'ve seen weakness, like in the business you sold to JDS. Sure. Obviously, we have a major difference in what we do in communications where some of the competitors obviously look at network monitoring and features that are basically, let\\'s say, software testing of higher levels. We\\'re testing R&D and manufacturing processes. So that is a significant difference. But I\\'ll let Guy add a little bit of color commentary. Yes, Ross, I would add that we have a very strong position in R&D and manufacturing with all the infrastructure OEMs, basestation builders. And as this market has been strong in Q3, you\\'ll see the results in our wireless numbers. Great. And maybe just, Didier, quickly on the cash flow. Could you just -- I know some of the moving parts for the quarter, but could you just remind us some of the key headwinds of why this is sort of a sub-par a year on cash flow versus what we would be used to given the sort of top line and profit results. Yes. I mean, on the year-over-year basis, most of the reduction in the cash flow from 2013 to 2014 will come from the separation cost, about $180 million, and debt redemption cost, these pluses and minuses. Also we are ending the year -- we are planning to end the year very, very strong. And even though we have best-in-class DSO of about 47, 48 days, that basically -- last year, we had a positive impact on receivables. This year we just need to -- we are building receivables, we are planning to build receivables at the end of the year to support basically, the much higher revenue growth expectation. Then again, we have best-in-class DSO so there\\'s no deterioration of DSO just applied to a higher revenue in Q4. So those are some of the main things. Just a question on the improvement in the academic and government spending. Was that a late quarter phenomenon or did you see pretty steady improvement during the quarter, just trying to get a feel for the pacing there a bit. Yes, what we are seeing is, in general, a rebound in the different geographies. I think the business is coming back honestly on easy compare relative to last year. I mean, I just can give you a few numbers. Worldwide academic research spending is pretty much flat in Europe, according to our information. China is spending about 12% growth in government funding. However, all  to the things Mike was highlighting, this picture is distorted, so that probably some of the money is spent towards the later part of the year and the U.S. is growing in about 2%. So overall I think it is a situation where we can say that it\\'s a relief in this market overall and we are seeing that in our order pattern as well. Okay. Great. And then just curious what you\\'re seeing in large pharma. You guys had called out spec and midsized companies as being strong. But I think last quarter, it sounded like order patterns had been disrupted a bit. So I guess, as the big deal speculation dies down a bit are you seeing things loosen somewhat or not really? That\\'s a good question. We still see big pharma still not loosening their clutches completely. I mean, we are done seeing the big deals we have seen in the past. I think the growth, as Bill has outlined, is coming off of mid to small companies. I mean, the reason for that is they are still in the situation of potential consolidation going on. But there\\'s also the patent cliff for small molecules. Even that is almost over and we are seeing a new trend in Europe, for example, that companies, traditional companies, are starting generic businesses after a lot of that business has been moved to India. And this helps, of course, the pharma market in general. But your specific question about big pharma, I would say this is not yet completely there. Just I guess a quick cleanup on the China dynamic. Would you be willing to quantify what percentage of total sales is exposed to this government-related, as well as the, I guess, the China FDA reorganization challenges in China. I\\'ll give you an opinion. The problem is, as you know, in China, is what do you define as government and what do you define as private? Because quite technically, all of the big chem companies, even though they\\'re held as a company, are effectively owned by the government. So I think that from our perspective and where Agilent is, essentially all of the issues are related to impact of government decisions. And I\\'m again just defining anything the government effectively controls, the investment strategy is effectively government-owned. And again if you look at -- I mean, the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the chemical industry, it\\'s all highly government-impacted. And so they really do make those fundamental decisions at the end of the day. And so if you take our definition, then it is essentially 100% driven by government decision. Okay. And then I just want to I guess follow up on that by asking, I guess on one hand, it doesn\\'t sound like you\\'re expecting that to come back in Q4. On the other hand, at the end of last quarter, you talked about strong order momentum in China. You said that again I think this quarter. I believe you typically don\\'t count something as an order unless you expect it to be fulfilled within about 6 months. So I\\'m just trying to reconcile these seemingly contradictory dynamics. And if my understanding is correct, are you trying to basically say that you do expect China to come back, but it may not be this quarter, it may be, say, Q1 of next year based on what you\\'re seeing from an order standpoint? Yes, I think that all of us are in the conventional wisdom that -- or a conventional view of thought that organizational changes are relatively straightforward. And that China continues to be the most -- the country with the greatest growth opportunities that we have. Every quarter, you\\'re a little bit disappointed. I think as Mike said, exactly right, I mean, we\\'re confident in the future, you just never know how the funding breaks. And you see that in the defense business, in Ron\\'s business. So I think we\\'re in a position of -- the guidance that we have is our best forecast of what\\'s going to happen in China, so we\\'re not expecting obviously any miracles, and we\\'ll just have to play it out. The good news is, is that in Asia overall, our business is pretty good. In other parts of Asia, we\\'ve been quite successful. And we\\'ll keep our fingers crossed and hope that Q4, the bottleneck breaks and we get stronger momentum going into \\'15. Okay and one last one. You\\'ve been tracking a bit ahead of plan thus far this year. If we think about that in the context of what you talked about in terms of dis-synergies on the new Agilent side going back to your March Analyst Day, has the fact that you\\'ve done a little bit better than expected provided you any opportunity to maybe pull some of that required investment forward and maybe benefit you from a dis-synergy standpoint next year? It\\'s actually working the opposite direction. Ron and the team and our whole core of a  team is doing so well for them to become independent that we have the risk of increasing the dis-synergies. As we said in -- and again, by dis-synergies, that\\'s meaning there\\'s more residual left over in Agilent to be able to manage through. However, and you see it based on our debt -- buying down our debt, we are still quite confident that first order dis-synergies in the new Agilent going forward will be offset by lower interest payments. Can I just spend a minute on gross margin? I\\'m wondering if kind of by each business, by LDG, by Chemical and by EMG. I\\'m just kind of looking at absolute revenues. I know for you guys, given the mix of business and the instrumentation, never occurred  whether to look year-over-year or sequentially, but if I just look at absolute revenues in LDG and then EMG in particular, you\\'re still not back to the kind of gross margins that you were at previously, and chemical doing a little bit better. So can you maybe just talk about gross margin trends by business and kind of where you\\'re at in your journey there? I\\'ll have Ron start on Keysight, again obviously, a lot of mix impact depending on what type of deals he takes. And then we\\'ll talk about the LDA going forward. Yes, so I would echo exactly what Bill just said. So as we move from quarter-to-quarter, the mix of our products, the mix of our sales has a pretty significant impact on our gross margins. And the other point that\\'s certainly relevant, as Ron mentioned in the script, is the price erosion that we see in certain markets, most notably in the wireless manufacturing space over the past several years, if you\\'re looking at multiple-year trends, has impacted gross margins. And I\\'ll just make some high-level comments, again, Jon, if you have additional details, the guys can give an answer. But LDG is by far the most competitive market that we have. I mean, our base comes from the applied. I think we continue to make great progress in Life Science and Diagnostics. The overall gross margin is solid. I would say very, very competitive in the market. But it is the most competitive market that we have moving forward. We have to win. I\\'m absolutely convinced this will continue to be the long-term growth engine of the company. But this is where the investment is, this is where by far, the most competition is. Fortunately on Mike\\'s team, on the Applied side, continues to do a superlative job. And you can really see the investment that we have made in spectroscopy and again, I alluded to it, and I\\'ll put the plug in, we have systematically redesigned every Varian product line that we received since 2010. And so the NMR, as we said in the past, which is counted in Fred\\'s gross margin, is behind that. We\\'ve introduced one product but we really have to turn the product line one more time. But spectroscopy, we\\'re basically done, not only did we spend the money to do it right, secondly, the market sees it. We\\'re winning the awards that indicate how successful we have with the Varian engineers working together with the Agilent engineers to really develop a great product. And so I think in summary, I think the differential change has been the progress we made on the spectroscopy side. I guess, just to follow up quickly on that, Bill. I guess, thinking about LDA overall as you go forward, I guess my question was around, you highlighted that there are a lot of opportunities on the gross margin side there given, in particular some of the other product lines that you just mentioned from Varian. Are we -- I guess, kind of has anything changed in terms of what you think the potential of that could be over the next 2 to 3 years, given what you\\'re seeing rolling now? Or is it going to take a little bit longer or is everything on track? I\\'m just trying to understand I guess the timing of these improvements. Okay. And then if I can quickly, Ron, can you, on the Electronic Measurement side, I know -- the way a lot of people have reported and it\\'s always hard as you already alluded to in earlier comments to compare one company to another depending on their mix and other pieces of business. But you guys obviously have a lot easier comps than others did in terms of what they were doing a year ago, you had some customer losses and things like that. I guess how would you just overall describe the environment and the overall test measurement market kind of putting aside all of these individual company issues? Maybe just give us a sense of how you describe the overall market. Sure. If you look at the -- sure, I\\'ll just break down by some of the segments. The semiconductor market looks good as they moved to some 20-nanometer pitches. The industrial market looks relatively flattish. The computer market itself is not growing very rapidly from all of the tablet conversion from PCs. In communications, we are seeing a buildout of the infrastructure in basestations, and that certainly helps as people move over to 4G. But there is massive handset manufacturing test pressure on pricing. As more people have entered into the market and people have been very, very aggressive on pricing, that really affects the attractiveness of that market. In aerospace/defense as we saw a nice rebound, a 13% growth in this past quarter, that\\'s from a free up from some of the spending that we saw last quarter and we expect to continue into Q4 with the end of the U.S. fiscal year. So overall on the markets, what we had talked about last year, we see communications a little bit better than the 2% growth that we outlined last quarter for fiscal year \\'14. We see also the aerospace/defense doing a little bit better than what we had outlined, but we do not see the industrial and computer segment tracking to the 5% that we outlined. So 2 segments are a little bit up, 1 segment is down and net-net, that gives us to our 8% growth for the half. We believe the market growth for next year will be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range, and we\\'re trying to get back to that growth rate. This is actually Bryan Kipp, on behalf of Paul. First one, I think I just want to piggyback on an earlier question on the specialty pharma growth. What\\'s really underlying that? I mean, there\\'s been commentary that there\\'s been an uptick in India. And I wonder if that\\'s kind of supporting some of the growth there. And is it additional products that you guys are seeing, is it focused in one area and one vertical for your business, or is it multiple? Just color on that will be helpful. I think we are seeing, as I said before, we are seeing pharma, in general, the big pharma probably more restrained than the smaller ones. I think the product portfolio we have at the moment is really ideally suited at this point in time to enter this market. I think with the new introductions in the LC space and in the LC/MS space, I think we have made inroads in that and the driving force is increasing productivity. These are the reasons why customers even under tight pressure are deciding to move on to purchase instruments in these times. And I think particular in India, I think we\\'re seeing an uptick. The growth in the market overall, we are seeing there the total market is probably at double-digit market growth at this point in time. And so yes, we are hoping that and are optimistic that the big pharma spending starts continuing towards the end of this year. Okay, and you think that the tail for the specialty pharma investment, especially I mean, the 11% you alluded to in India, do you think that has some longevity to it? And I guess in addition, I think there\\'s a question on pacing for academic and government especially in Europe, how do you guys see that pace throughout the quarter? Do you see -- I know you said rebound overall, but did it get stronger month over month? The rates, yes, I believe even so that the spending as I said before is relatively flat, I think that the batches  is released and we are seeing continuous investments being made by the institutions and just one fact, in Europe, the European Parliament has just released a fund of about $5 billion for the next 10 years for bio-related research. Okay. And then, Mike, if I can do a quick follow-up. I know U.S. refining capacity has been pretty strong to start the year. U.S. is I think you guys have alluded to, has been not robust but it\\'s has been steady grower for you all to start the year, hasn\\'t been too crazy. Color around that and then I didn\\'t see anything on the Middle East. Is that starting to fall off a little bit or be more flat, are you still seeing support there? Yes, great question. Thanks for the opportunity to provide additional color. So let\\'s maybe start with the Middle East. That part of the world continues to be a very strong growth region for us. They\\'re investing in capacity in-country, moving -- trying to move higher end of the value chain of refined products. So that area is growing nicely for us. And in the U.S., I think the commentary is still relatively the same as last quarter, which was overall, the industry has probably never been healthier in the U.S. fueled by the low-cost of the fuel stocks from shale gas. And we\\'re seeing plans by our major customers to add infrastructure, build capacity. That hasn\\'t yet come online and translated into new business. So the business is still a steady grower, but I think as the profit pools continue to grow and invest, I think we could look toward a healthier investment environment for us down the road. Actually, I sort of have a mechanics question, and just sort of looking more in terms of how you\\'re going to report fourth quarter. And I just want to make sure I understand. So you basically said you\\'re just going to report the Agilent LDA business as it sort of stands and no commentary on Keysight, is that correct? No. We will report Agilent results with Keysight in Q4. We will discuss in the earnings call the new Agilent going forward. And Ron and team will have a separate investor call afterwards to talk about the results of Q4 and their guidance for FY \\'15. So for Agilent, no change except that obviously, in terms of our financial report, but obviously the focus of the presentation will solely be on LDA. And then on -- at the same time about Keysight will present their financial results and provide their report on their business separately from Agilent. Okay great. Just want to clarify that. So you\\'d mentioned some strengths in the single quad market. Is that the new 6120 that you\\'re talking about? Yes, okay. And then I mean, that goes against -- I mean, you\\'re targeting that for the chromatography market, and that\\'s going against one of your competitor\\'s product, the QDa, on that. Is that -- is that wins against gap products in that market, or just a little bit dynamics on what you\\'re seeing since that\\'s obviously a new sort of instrument for that sort of chromatographic researcher standpoint. I think that\\'s actually a good question. I think we are winning against our competitors at the moment, particularly the product is refilling  just by the fact that our product is more universally usable, and it\\'s more flexible in the application space. It can be deployed and I think that\\'s the major difference between the product, which actually is also from a price perspective, very competitive, and I think those 2 factors are driving the growth in the total single quad market, but also particular against this instrument. I would say it\\'s driving also new instruments in the LC space, particular where these single quads are used in more routine applications, pharma clearly. This is one of the reasons why we are seeing small -- in the small pharma space, small company pharma space, we are seeing this growth rates. Great. And then just one quick question. On the PDL1 ligand, the companion diagnostic. How do we -- I\\'ve had a number of questions from investors about how to sort of think about the size of that market and that opportunity for companion diagnostic. Can you give us some color around that, and I guess relate that to maybe what your experience was sort of with the  I mean, it is -- yes, sorry, good question as well. I think it is very difficult to say how big the market is because there is no real commercial product at the market at the moment. At the moment, Agilent is providing services, development services, for products which are not yet on the market. And I think this is the value proposition at this point in time. However, once those products -- I mean, I\\'m talking about the pharmaceutical products, make it through the value chain, I think, then we can talk about markets that is why it is very difficult at the moment to assess that. And again, I think as Fred said, just look at it as a service opportunity, that we\\'re providing services, and the big payoff is, if we\\'re lucky enough to -- and skillful enough to partner with somebody that they will deliver a differential product in the marketplace, we will get the additional revenue from supporting those reagents and instruments. I mean just one anecdotal information, if you look to the development of new drugs at the moment, I think a big part of the drugs, and if you correlate that with the success of the drugs in the clinics, it\\'s correlating with companion diagnostic, which is codeveloped basically with the drug itself. And I think this is the opportunity afterwards beyond the service business, as Bill just said. Ron, I\\'m wondering, you mentioned revenue pull forward for Keysight ahead of the official go live date on August 1. Is there any way you can quantify that? Okay. And then is there any chance you guys might be wanting to comment at all on \\'15? I mean if we look -- the Street\\'s, I think, 5% core for LDG and 5.5% for EMG. Ron, you just talked about the market growing 2.5% to 3%. So as we think out there for next year any preliminary thoughts? We\\'re going to have to wait to next earnings call before we give the \\'15 guidance moving forward. And also I think it\\'s important not speaking for Ron, but working with his new board to make sure that everyone\\'s aligned for their guidance in \\'15, and likewise with our board. Okay. And then lastly, you explicitly in the pathology talked about Europe being strong. Can you maybe just talk to the dynamics there and then what was going on in the U.S. and if there was a reason that wasn\\'t called out today? Yes, well, Fred\\'s clearly the expert in Europe, so I\\'ll have Fred talk about again, the continued strength that we have in Europe both from a product standpoint and a customer standpoint. I think you see a tremendous tick-up in our sales in Europe and this is mainly driven through the product categories I have been talking about. And it\\'s across the market, so including Mike\\'s markets as well. And we see the academia  government for the reasons I have given before also picking up. And I believe it is the pharmaceutical industry which drives growth, even though we don\\'t see the full potential yet, so I\\'m optimistic that this trend really continues. And Fred, this is Mike. If I can maybe just build on your comments and maybe add a geographic perspective. Within Europe, we often think of Europe as being Western Europe. But if you look to what we call the IDO, the Eastern Europe part of our business, it actually is growing quite strongly as well, so there\\'s both a economic, geographic dimension sort of under the covers if you will in our European numbers. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Thank you, Karen. And on behalf of the management team and myself, I\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please call us at IR and we\\'ll be happy to get back to you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day. Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Agilent Technologies’ Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  Please note, today’s conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, please go ahead. Thank you, Karen, and welcome everyone to Agilent’s second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2014. With me are Bill Sullivan, Agilent’s President and CEO; Ron Nersesian, CEO of Keysight Technologies; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Didier’s comments will be the presidents of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics groups, Mike McMullen and Fred Strohmeier. Also joining from Keysight will be Neil Dougherty, CFO; and Guy Séné, Senior Vice President of R&D and Sales. You can find the press release and information to supplement today’s discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an investor presentation along with revenue breakouts, business segment results, and historical financials for Agilent’s operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today’s comments by Bill, Ron, and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company and the separation of the electronic measurement business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Lastly, as we expect the third quarter to be the final quarter before Agilent’s Electronic Measurement Group begins operating as Keysight Technologies, comments today will also refer to the Electronic Measurement Group as Keysight. Thanks, Alicia, and hello everyone. Today, Agilent reported second quarter revenues and EPS in line with commitments, with solid growth in orders. Revenues of $1.73 billion were unchanged from a year ago. Q2 orders of $1.81 billion were up 7% over last year. Adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share were at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 18.2%. Keysight revenues came in at the high end of expectations. LDA revenues were slightly below the low end of our guidance. Both businesses built backlog as orders accelerated late in the quarter. Book-to-bill for Agilent was 1.05 positioning us well as we move into Q3. Our work to split the company continues to proceed smoothly. By the beginning of August, we expect Keysight to operate independently as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. We continue to expect the separation to be completed by early November. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science, diagnostics and applied markets that will become the new Agilent. Following my remarks, Ron will discuss electronic measurement markets that will become Keysight. Finally, Didier will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent’s overall financial results, as well as our guidance for fiscal Q3 and fiscal year. Turning to LDA, second quarter revenue of $988 million grew 2% year-over-year on both a reported and core basis. We saw good growth across pharma, clinical and diagnostics, energy and food businesses tempered by the results in academic and government and environmental markets. Orders accelerated at the end of the quarter as we built backlog. Book-to-bill for LDA was 1.04, with orders of $1.03 billion, up 4% or 5% on a core basis over last year. Operating margins, adjusted to revenue, were in line with guidance. Turning now to performance by end market, in life sciences, we saw strength in pharma/biotech, up 4% led by demand from midsized and specialized pharma customers. Diagnostics and clinical revenues were up 7% driven by record companion diagnostics growth and strong demand for CGH arrays and target enrichment solutions. Academic and government remained soft, down 6% year-over-year as government spending delays in the U.S. and China pressured results. In the applied markets Food Testing was up 10% with globalization of the food supply and brand protection continuing to drive strong demand. Energy grew 2% led by the U.S. and refinery projects in the Middle East conversely environmental and forensics were down 5% impacted by government funding. On a regional basis LDA performance was mixed. Double digit growth in Europe was broad based across markets. In the Americas revenues were down 2% on delays in U.S. government spending and softness in Latin America. Asia-Pacific was down 3% affected by slower government funding and lengthened approval cycles in China. We saw improvement in China towards the end of the quarter. Within LDA our life science and diagnostic group had Q2 revenue of $577 million, up 1% from a year ago as recurring revenues offset softness in instrumentation. Orders of $598 million were up 3% year-over-year, operating margin was 13% for the quarter. In early May LDG recently announced the latest version of chromatography data systems CDS software called OpenLAB CDS. New features include flexible data capture, improved automation and faster data analysis. We also introduced a range of new LC products during this quarter’s HPLC 2014 in New Orleans. Announcements include a new next generation UHP-LC multi-sampler which sets a new benchmark in throughput, speed and carryover. We also introduced an updated two dimensional LC system for higher resolution applications. And we are launching a series of new LC/MS and GC/MS products at ASMS next month. These solutions are differentiated by higher performance and lower cost of ownership making them ideally suited for the applications in our core markets. The chemical analysis group had Q2 revenues of $411 million, up 3% and led by strong demand for GC/MS and ICP-MS and services. Orders of $432 million grew 6% year-over-year. Operating margin was 22% for the quarter. The ultra high performance of 7200 GC/Q-TOF continues to exceed expectations with Europe leading all regions for the adaption of high-resolution, accurate GC/MS. CAG recently signed a major contract with a leading environmental company in Beijing. Agilent will supply GC/MS technology for online air monitoring systems, related to ozone and other air pollution – airborne pollutants. Looking forward, LDA’s outlook remains positive, supported by our backlog build, a robust pipeline of new products and expectations for increased flows in government spending. We remain committed to creating shareholder value by increasing our organic growth rate, delivering complete workflow solutions for our customers and growing earnings faster than revenues. Moving forward, our priorities are to continue our late-Q2 order momentum into Q3, launch a series of new products and continue to drive our manufacturing cost reduction programs. LDA revenues for the fiscal third quarter of FY ‘14 are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.02 billion, or nearly 5% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 18.5%. For the full year, we now expect LDA revenues to range from $4.02 billion to $4.12 billion with operating margins at the midpoint of 19.3%. Didier will provide additional details in his commentary. Thank you for being on the call. Now I will turn it over to Ron to talk about Keysight and the Electronic Measurement business. Thank you, Bill and hello everyone. I have three key headlines for you regarding Keysight’s performance in Q2. First, Keysight came in at the top end of its revenue and operating profit margin guidance. Second, Keysight orders returned to growth in Q2. And third, Keysight is on track with its plans to separate from Agilent. Now, moving to the specifics, revenue of $743 million declined 2% or 1% on a core basis, while orders of $782 million were up 11% year-over-year. This resulted in a book to bill ratio of 1.05. Keysight continued to not only effectively manage gross margins and spending, but also had a favorable mix profile this quarter. Keysight generated operating profit of $148 million and an operating margin of 20% for the quarter. Looking to our end market performance, aerospace and defense revenues declined 6% year-over-year. With U.S. budget approvals in place, direct government demand has improved, while prime contractor business in the U.S. remains soft. International aerospace and defense demand was mixed but steady. Industrial computers and semiconductors revenues increased 3% year-over-year, investments in next generation semiconductor process technologies continued in the second quarter, while computer markets remains soft. Communications revenue declined 6% year-over-year. We continue to see strength in 4G base station infrastructure demand, while handset device manufacturing remains moderate. On a regional basis, we saw very good growth in Asia excluding Japan, which grew over 20% with strength across most market segments. The Americas region was down double-digits year-over-year versus the strong compare. Decline – Japan declined 12% or down 4% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency. Europe was essentially flat year-over-year. As I discussed during our Analyst Day in March, Keysight is transforming its product portfolio with the goal of returning to market growth rates. This quarter, we began shipping both UXM wireless test set for R&D and the EXM wireless test set for manufacturing. The EXM wireless test set won 2013 Product of the Year award from the Electronic Products China. In April, Keysight expanded its performance network analyzer series with a low price model targeted at low cost RF components used in handsets and consumer products. Keysight also introduced two high performance portable oscilloscopes deploying next generation technology. One set a new standard for signal integrity and the other set a new standard for price performance. We expect Keysight to begin operating as a subsidiary of Agilent on August 1, and to complete the spin-off in early November. As part of our journey, we are announcing today that we expect Keysight common stock to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KEYS. In addition, at the end of this quarter we will implement an operational cut over of our IT systems. This transition requires tight coordination of our shipment and delivery plans. We are working with customers on the cut over which could cause some revenue to ship between the quarters. As Bill had said, it takes a lot of work to create two great companies from one. Along with all of the excellent internal work, we continue to focus on our customers and all of their measurement solutions needs. Turning to the outlook for Q3, we expect Keysight to return to revenue growth with revenues in the range of $720 million to $760 million. We project core growth at the midpoint to be 5% and operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.4%. For the full year, we expect revenues in the range of $2.86 billion to $3 billion, which represents 2% core growth at the midpoint. Operating margins for the full year are expected to be 18.9% at the midpoint. Thank you, Ron, and hello everyone. To recap the quarter, our revenue of $1,731 million, operating margin of 18.2% and earnings per share of $0.72 were all at the midpoint of our guidance. Orders exceeded our expectations, but the quarter end orders queue was also higher than usual. By business, most of the operating profit variance versus the midpoint of our guidance was due to volume and mix. Please note that Q2 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported on the slide deck posted on our website. This quarter, currency subtracted about 0.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth, and acquisitions had no material impact. Finally, we bought back $50 million of stock in Q2 and generated $272 million in free cash flow, slightly higher than last year. I will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion and EPS of $0.72 to $0.74. At midpoint, revenue will grow 5% on a core basis. Our 18.5% projected operating margin at midpoint will be 30 basis points higher than Q2 fiscal year ‘14 and 20 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. Now, remember that we initiated a drastic cut in discretionary expenses early February of last year that resulted in significant expense reductions in the ensuing months. So, we face a tough compare. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we are also investing in key growth initiatives. Now, to the guidance for fiscal year 2014, we are confirming the guidance we provided last quarter for both revenue and EPS. And as a reminder, we expect fiscal year ‘14 revenues to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and fiscal year ‘14 EPS to range from $2.96 to $3.16. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe for both Bill and Ron, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the kind of the pacing in the quarter, I think you made some comments that orders picked up towards the end of the quarter, in particular in China that some of the delay you start to see materialize. I don’t know if that was more just an LDA comment or if that was also a Keysight comment? And then can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the other emerging markets and whether you are seeing any impact in countries like Russia or Eastern Europe given the environment over there? Yes, I will just make a couple of comments, Jon, regarding LDA and then turn it over to Ron, because the real start of the quarter in my mind is the fantastic order performance of Keysight will maintain their operational excellence. As Didier alluded to, the orders in LDA came in late in the quarter, which is atypical given that half the business is in consumables and parts that it tends to have a more uniform order pattern than you typically see in Keysight. So, we had a back end bias, that obviously affect our revenue. Our revenue was below our own internal expectations and external guidance moving forward. The good news is the orders were there. And as we guided going forward, I think we are in solid position moving into Q3, but we really did have a surge of orders at the end that was out of typical sequence moving forward. And I will rather turn it over to Ron and talk about Keysight. And Jon, if you have any other questions, I can have Mike and Fred talk specifically in terms of what they saw in their respective businesses. Ron? The story was a little bit different in Keysight where we saw orders that were a little bit more balanced throughout the quarter. Clearly with wireless manufacturing, the orders are lumpy. And the good news is that with the wireless manufacturing and semiconductor business that we had, we achieved more orders towards the first two-thirds of the quarter and that enabled us to exceed our revenue guidance. As far as the emerging markets, Russia is the biggest wildcard that we have given that everything of that is going on over there politically. We actually had a decent quarter, but we are cautiously watching what will happen as we look in Q3. We expect our performance in Q3 in Russia to be flat and all signs so far on a local level appear to be consistent with that. I will just follow up, Jon. And maybe Mike, you could make some comments with the order pattern on the applied side and then Fred on the life science and diagnostics side. Yes, sure, Bill. Jon, it’s Mike McMullen. I just had some additional commentary on the quarter, very pleased with the overall order rate for the business. And I think you can see the backlog we have built and the difference between the growth rate of our segment orders versus revenue and particularly pleased by a return to really solid growth in our core instrumentation platforms. And as you know, that’s been an area of struggle in the last several quarters, where you have been looking for this churn on in the replacement market. So, what we are seeing is warming up of the replacement market and signs of return of spending on some of the government side, particularly in the U.S. and promises in China. So, very encouraged by the overall global results, in particular how we have finished the quarter in China. Yes, let me just add also couple of comments. If you look to the different markets we saw strength in the pharmaceutical market as Bill has pointed out on the one side even so the consolidation puts some hold on it and the growth rate was predominantly coming from smaller pharma companies. I think if you look to the geographies, I think China was a little bit behind I think with a bit suffering in the U.S. I think Europe was doing quite well and specifically to the comment on Russia, even so there is impact, I think the size of the business from an LDG perspective is rather marginal, so minor impact from that perspective. Okay. And maybe just kind of two quick follow-ups on, from the LDA side, just to be clear maybe what did you grow in China in the quarter and what’s your expectation for the year? And then for Ron, on the Keysight side, I think you guided to 5% core growth in the third quarter, I think in the – at your Analyst Day, you kind of commented on high single-digit growth for Keysight in the second half of the year. So, I am just curious if that guidance still stands as well? Thanks. They give you an indication in round numbers. China’s business was down mid single-digits. The flipside orders were up mid single-digits. And on the Keysight, our guidance from last quarter still stands and we had expected 5% in Q3 and then that accelerates in Q4. Hi, good afternoon. So you essentially reiterated LDA revenue and you guided the July revenue quarter about in line with what we were expecting. So all-in-all, no real change in guidance or quarterly placing to revenue. However, your fiscal Q2 operating performance in LDA was much weaker than expected and you guided fiscal Q3 op margin for the group a bit below our expectations. So, this implies that fiscal Q4 operating margin I think gets up to somewhere between 21.5% and 22% assuming them doing the math right? And if so this implies an incremental above 30%, so year-over-year, this doesn’t seem Herculean, but it does arguably represent a pretty material level of improvement over the last two quarters of the year relative to what was a weak quarter this quarter. So, can you talk about how confident you are in this guidance and more specifically what makes you so confident that you can get to those levels subsequent to this performance? And I think as you are talking about this, I think to be fair, you guys didn’t spend a lot of time explaining why the margins in LDA came in, in these levels in the quarter. So maybe you can talk a little bit more about that? So, hi Doug, this is Didier. I was talking about the numbers and then probably my colleagues will want to talk about their confidence to achieve the second half, but in terms of Q2 what happened is yes, LDA’s operating profit was below the guidance that is very much in line with our revenue mix, which again was due to orders being skewed towards the end of the quarter. And therefore, we will recover that mix into the second half. And that explains the second half patterns. So, basically nothing fundamental, nothing special in Q2, the only – the main reason by far for the operating margins performed below the guidance is volume and mix and as we are recovering because we have a high backlog go into Q3, obviously we will see that the offset in the second half. Now within the second half, there is no doubt that Q4 I mean even the second half even though there is an expectation of a significant improvement in operating margin between Q2 and Q3 for LDA, there is further improvement expected from Q3 to Q4 in line with the revenue growth. I will just add on to Didier and it goes back,  is correct Q4 is our strongest quarter of the year, very typical and at companies like ours that last quarter tends to be strong. And if you go back in 2013 LG went from Q3 to Q4 from 60% operating profit to 19% and the chemical analysis went from 21.5% to 25%. So again we are not forecasting anything that is we have not seen in the past and obviously both Mike and Fred have committed to meet this guidance. Okay. Alright, thank you for that. That’s helpful and if I could ask one more, I think it’s interesting that you noted challenges for LDA in China within the academic government end market due to the release of budgets, over the course of the recent earnings season, we have really heard this only from Waters, I mean we heard a little bit from others, but they didn’t really call it out as notably as you and Waters have. And I am pointing the companies like Thermo, Danaher, PKI and Bruker to name a few, so on the surface the common denominator here seems to be maybe instrument mix as a percentage of sales and possibly more exposure to LC, I am just curious if you would speak to what specifically you are seeing in terms of what’s slowing down in China within the academic government end market and what isn’t, I think it would just be helpful to sort of contextualize what is going on and why this seems to be specifically impacting some more than others? Thank you. Yes. One of these – I will have both Fred and Mike comment on that and again the China FDA is in major reorganization and parts of the business they regulate we have very large market shares. And but I will have Fred start on the academic research and then also Mike can chime in on some of the applied and food areas where we have very strong positions. Yes. Thank you, Bill. Let me make one statement about the growth in China overall. If you look to the second quarter and compare that to this year’s second quarter and you compare that to the second quarter last year, I think the growth in general has slowed as such, so that’s the general observation. Secondly, I think if you look to the pharmaceutical industry, there has been quality regulation imposed to the pharmaceutical industry in the GMP space, good manufacturing practices. And this why is the part of the consolidation in India, China – in the China pharmaceutical industry which means another investment is retarded quite a bit. So China academic spending as Bill already pointed out I think this has been also a temporary slow down due to some regulations, which have been put in place in terms of anticorruption, which is also something which probably will go away over time once the process has been installed. And finally, as Bill also pointed out, China FDA is at the moment restructuring the food testing labs. And until this restructuring has been completed, I think we will see a shorter investment pattern of the food labs which probably is in the order of a couple of $10 million a quarter. And I think this will – as soon as this has been removed although it will stimulate the orders again. I am just building on Fred’s comments specific to the food market, it’s a heavy platform usage of LC in the food market where Agilent as you know has a leadership position. So where the double-edged sword where we really are affected when see budgets shift to latter part of the year, I think there is a heavy concentration of liquids base used in that market segment. And again that’s why in the early part of the call I indicated I was very delighted by our performance in Q2 from the order perspective because despite the challenges that were highlighting here in terms of timing of the food orders in China. We saw a very strong growth in the environmental side as well as expanding in the petrochemical and chemical side, in the private sector side of the marketplace. So that’s why we’re looking ahead to second half 2014 you’re getting a positive view overall about the business. Just one final comment with regards to China I mean it’s slightly different in this space of genomics and diagnostic, this is where we saw a different pattern and we saw pronounced close beyond the instrumentation Mike and I were talking before. Yes. Just Bill could you just kind of address I think when you were talking about LDA in total you commented about revenue out of Europe being plus double-digits with pretty much Americas and Asia-Pac softer. Could you just be a little bit more specific, is that end-markets are – what was as strong in Europe? Well Europe is as strong as I had noted across all markets and again Fred having – living in Europe talk a little bit about it and then Mike chime in. But our Europe team just did an outstanding job across all of our products to be able to grow in the low teens growth rate in orders. Fred. Yes. I think Europe is as we see the recovery particularly in the academia and government royalty we’re seeing a stimulus of the autos. And if you look to the different industries and then Mike can comment on the chemical analysis side. We saw a significant pickup in the pharmaceutical industry, these are pretty successful particularly that was the LC/MS and I believe this will continue in the second half. And just to build on Fred’s comments what a difference a year makes. So Europe was a real area of strength for us in the quarter. As Bill mentioned our team is doing an outstanding job driving share in what is now a growing market for us and we started to see an uptake in the chemical energy space in terms of replacement side of the business, investments in the food area continue to be very strong in Europe as well as in the forensic area. Okay. And then just a quick question on Keysight, when we look at the order growth the 12% order growth year-over-year, I’m curious if – Ron can you give a picture of is that order growth strengthened significantly in either any of these three pieces in particular comps or A&D and is there some recapture of market share that you could – that you can identify? First of all, 11% order growth was driven with two main areas. As you know the wireless manufacturing business is a lumpy business and we’re very successful in that area in the base station growth as we mentioned. The second thing we talked about last quarter as well as today is in the semiconductor expansion as they move to new technologies and again that was something that also drove our business. I was pleased to see double-digit order growth in all of our major regions except Japan which is having some problems, so that is a nice point that led to our 11% growth. Ron, one of the things that we kind of picked up in the channel in the A&D business in particular on the defense side, the Department of Defense, U.S. they I believe they’ve changed the way they are purchasing and previously they had purchased test equipment and pushed that test equipment down to the vendors stating the protocol and providing the test equipment. And our understanding is that, that has switched around now the DoD is asking the vendors to purchase the equipment and I’m curious is that changed anything in the channel for instance lease verse purchase or.. No, we’ve always seen a mix between direct government purchases and purchases by the prime contractors. As I mentioned earlier the direct government purchases has picked up but the prime purchasing has not. And if you look at the financial results of the prime contractors in the U.S. that would sort of explain it. Internationally there was no significant change there that business was roughly consistent with where it was before. Great. Thank you. Could you speak to the order trends in large pharma, I know you mentioned mid-size and I think specialty pharma was strong, but I’m asking because there was an increase in M&A chatter towards the end of the quarter. And I’m wondering if it has put any freeze on ordering? Look we’re seeing in the pharmaceutical market at this point in time that the consolidation talks between the big pharmas like Pfizer and AstraZeneca is certainly putting some hold on the whole investment pattern in the pharmaceutical industry. I think as I said before the smaller pharma companies are driving the growth at this point in time and I think over time as soon as this situation has speed up I think we will see that those big companies will go to single vendor their concepts and I think our opportunity there is to be a systems provider for those big pharmaceutical companies. That’s helpful. And Didier a follow-up on Doug’s question from earlier. Can you elaborate a bit more on the negative mix component in LDG and still trying to get my arms around since it was the lowest performance in a couple of years? Yes, I mean I won’t go into the detail but when you do the math we have about you would expect 65% contribution margin versus the variable cost of sales. So if you do the math on the reduction in revenue versus the guidance that we provided and you still get 65% of the reduction in revenue will fold to the bottom line basically it was flat it’s like $4 million to $5 million and doing the analysis and again we have plenty, plenty of products and the markets and the product lines like that. Whatever it is not explained by peer volume which is about $4 million we could explain it mostly by mix factor. Thank you. And then finally a really quick one. Did you notice anything in the Life Science and Diagnostic and Chemical Analysis businesses? Did you notice anything unusual about the revenue or ordering patterns from Japan in the quarter, and I ask because there has been some discussion that a tax change for one might have shipped it around some purchasing and you guys with in April and quarters should have – could have some insight into that? I think the one – I think it was in March, I think we saw a pretty good month because this was just before the tax rate and I think this good all the way got partially compensated by the April, by the fact that there was a higher sales tax. And but in general if you look to LDG I think you have exhibited some overall growth in Japan. Hi, thanks for taking the question. EMG came in at the high end of guidance. Can you talk to maybe where you’re most surprised to the upside? And then looking ahead you did have a competitor that’s talking about in handset testing another $300 million or so coming out of that market, you maybe just talk us whether you still think flat growth to that market is the right assumption? Sure. The semiconductor market or the semiconductor test equipment market was very hot and we have very high margins in that business and accordingly that helped us and that’s why we had such outstanding incremental above the midpoint of the guidance over 80%, but that’s not something that we expect to repeat. We had been seeing a lot of price pressure in the handset wireless manufacturing segment, that is why our strategy continues to be to move more and more to R&D, but that pressure that is there on the pricing continues to accelerate. So if you take a mix of high let’s just call it a lot of semiconductor shipments and very little or less handset manufacturing shipments you get the very, very strong incrementals. As we go to next quarter we expect to have a much more normal balance as we move from Q2 to Q3. And your view on just kind of the overall handset testing market I mean do you think that, that market remains flat or or do you see it consolidating in fact? I think there is enough – there is significant price pressure as that market has become crowded and manufactures continue to look for simpler ways to test their products. It’s all about cost per test. The market is very competitive and it’s one of the lower margin areas or one of the lower margin businesses that are there. We are seeing competitors will be acting more desperate ways on the pricing side and we are doing the right thing for the shareholder and making sure we are going to return in everything that we invest in and where we put our effort. And then for LDA it sounds like environmental front  kind of the delta relative to the expectation, can you maybe just talk to it, it sounds like you are expecting a recovery in that business for the back half of the calendar year, is that driving the potential upside. And then you had previously called out some delays I think in pathology did those come through this quarter? I will jump right in and my perspective here. So the environmental and forensic business was down in Q2. The story here remains the weakness in government spending particularly in the more developed countries and economies. When I look to the second half, we are expecting to see improvement in the area as some of the government budgets are released let’s say in the U.S. So we are expecting some uptick in the second half in those areas, both at the federal and state level. But I also think the bigger driver is China as the overall global food market and the growth in the chemical energy space, our major customers are now talking about and in investing in capacity in the U.S. because of the lower feedstocks making their overall operations much more profitable. So clearly there is an element of recovery building around the environmental forensics market, but I also expect strong growth in other two larger markets. And then Bill, can you just comment on that, did you have some policy orders that came through from the prior quarter? Yes. This is – it looks like you are right I think we had a really strong quarter for diagnostics and genomics. And particular the diagnostics piece was growing mid-single digits and it’s driven by the pathology business and even more so by the companion diagnostics which we believe was outstanding as Bill mentioned at his initial comments, I think genomics we see a pronounced need in the market at the moment I think its growing about mid-digit to high-mid digit range. And it’s predominantly driven by cytogenetics and the CGH race. And secondly the target enrichment business, which is going very nicely were also relative to our competitors. Thanks for taking the question, actually, Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Ron, I just wanted to start on EMG. I know its kind have been discussed throughout some additional question here you talked about wireless manufacturing orders and semiconductor orders starting off pretty strong and then pull through in the quarter. Where it’s some of those orders stuff you expected in the second – I guess in the third quarter. I know you said that 5% expect progress anyway and then in addition to that first quarter growth obviously has to be in that high end of prior guidance the second half alluded to 8%. What’s really driving that for I know you mentioned strength in the wireless or semiconductor demand but is it new products some existing products legacy products. Just to give more clarity on that? Sure. First of all, there was nothing pulled up to when we look at the 5% nothing was pulled into Q3 that would make that Q3 looked weaker that’s probably this components with the 5%. We’ve always assumed an economic outlook that would pick-up towards the end of the year that’s where as a low level base line and top of that’s a government which has not been purchasing very much obviously during sequestration, they finally are getting their act together on getting money out to the people that make to decisions. So we expect the government business to accelerate towards the end of the fiscal year for the government in September in the U.S. On top that our seasonally high quarter is always Q4 so Q4 is our strongest quarter and if you look at what we did last year $705 million in Q4 was a relatively low compare. So if you take a look at the low compare you look at your 780 ish million dollars in orders in Q2 we typically see Q2 and Q4 be strong against a compare of $705 million you can do the math and get there pretty quickly with any type of economic strength or slow recovery and with some new products that are coming out. I mentioned the UXM and EXM where our competitive position is very strong, it’s as strong as it has been in years in those areas but will continue to build on those. Yes. I appreciate it. And then I guess just an additional follow-up on the chemical side. You cited  office a strong adoption in Europe, I think it since consecutive quarters of strong refinery demand in the Middle East. The order bookings were plus 7% on a core basis is to be driven by broader QC adoption and demand or what’s really driving that core order growth there? Great question. So thanks for that. So, on the mass spectrometry side there continued to be demand particularly for technologies that allow you look for unknown. This has become an increasingly desired capability both in the food but also in the forensics area and that’s why I spoke earlier to some bright spots in terms of forensics coming up. So the demand from mass spectrometry is really been driven by – continuing to driven by the food market but also there is emerging requirement to identify unknown both in the food supply as well as in designer drugs for forensics. And then you hit the nail really in the head in terms of what’s going out in terms of Middle East we’re seeing infrastructure build-out, major projects coming to fruition and Agilent is very strong in this space and we’re getting the business. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if on the LDA side just wanted to talk a little bit more into the weakness this quarter on revenue. Was there any meaningful impact from your exit last year from the high end NMR markets? I’m just trying to get a sense of whether that was a factor and just as we move to the balance of the year maybe you could put some color around that wakened your expectations just given we’ll be lapping through the exit on that business but at the same time you had a pretty healthy order dynamic this quarter? Yes. Our shortfall in revenue in the quarter as we have said is really directed to the late orders that came in they were atypical. The NMR business was non-material to that issue at all. And as you can hear from the comments for every place that we had some good news we had some offsetting bad news. And so quite frankly it was the mixed quarter and I think the message is the orders ended up being strong and we feel comfortable with the guidance that we’ve given as we move into the second half of the year. Got it. And I apologize if you guys gave the number, but just hoping for the overall growth rate in China, if you could speak to that, I know you guys gave a consolidated Asia Japan number, but maybe try to tease out China on the growth rate and looking what you’re expecting for the balance of the year there? Thank you. On the LDA side the business was down mid single digits, orders were up mid single digits moving forward. And for us to be able to grow 5% in the second half we have to continue to see the order momentum in China as we move forward I think both Mike and Fred talked about where we think that there will be opportunity as the government reorganizations and focus are completed. And that was indicative of stronger orders in China at the end of the quarter. Thanks. Good afternoon. Bill, in terms of the late 2Q order surge, was it attributable to any particular end market customer or geography or would you characterize it as more broad-based? Mike and Fred make a comment from an aggregate it was broad-base, but Mike and Fred probably a little more insight, if there is any nuances, I am not sure statistically there is a lot of variation. We do tend to have a surge of orders at the end of every year on the LDA side as I had mentioned, it’s because only half the business at capital equipment, it tends not be as high as you typically see in Keysight, but Mike if you have some thoughts and then Fred. Yes. Just to build on Bill’s comments, geographically I think the story we have already talked about China and the strong close there. We also saw in the United States and in Europe. And I think those three geographies really drove the results for the quarter. And just to repeat some of the earlier commentary in terms of strength in the food market, which continues to globally very strong market for us, even with the government push-up in China in terms of major projects. And I said earlier, the return to growth in the chemical and energy space is really promising to see. Yes. Also building on the Mike’s comments, I think we talked about the pharmaceutical industry and I think you will see a slight uptick in the second half. I mean, we talked about the academia and government market, we believe there will be some relief of the budgets that we can participate. And I think Europe in general as Mike said was going quite well. So, from that perspective, I think we are positive that we can deliver the results Didier was referring to. Thanks. And then Didier, I didn’t hear you mentioned our expected share count for end of the year. Should we still expect about 100 million of share repurchase activity in the back half? We have – last time at the analyst meeting we talked about spending $400 million over the next, I mean this year – over this year and next. So far, we have got $115 million this fiscal year and we will see. In terms of the share count, you can assume for the projections 338 million shares in Q3 and 339 million shares in Q4. Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. This is Robert for Patrick this afternoon. Couple of questions. We talked a lot about China and LDA. I am just wondering, Ron, if you could perhaps decide on how EMG fared in China, any impacts from the LTE rollout? We, as I mentioned earlier on a broad basis that we did very well in base station infrastructure build. There is a lot of manufacturing that goes on in that area, but nothing unique in China this quarter. So, we continue to be very competitive in that space, but nothing significant to report. Great, thank you for that. And sort of staying on the kind of EMG tales, I am wondering if you can provide any update on UXM and how – has that led to an improvement in your position in wireless or have you see any gain in share of the customers you had previously lost share in? Yes. By adding the UXM, which is the R&D wireless test set, we have actually been involved in much more direct conversations, more bids in winning more business than we have done previously. The way it’s typically done is someone will test out the box, figure out if it has the right type of coverage or testing capability. And then it’s a like it enough with one product, they will start using it and then that gets replicated. The response on UXM has been excellent, but the R&D market is not like the manufacturing market, where someone likes it, they will go buy 2,000 of them at once that will rollout in a much slower area. So, R&D, we see a much steadier pace not as volatile, not as fast up, not as fast down, but we are very pleased with both the UXM and the EXM in their competitiveness. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Thank you, Karen. And I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today and wish you all a good day. If you have any questions, please call us at IR and we will be happy to give them an answer. Thank you.

Before turning the call over to Bill, I’d like to remind you that will host its annual analysts meeting in New York City on March 6. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website two weeks prior to that date. Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported first quarter orders of $1.68 billion, down 2% from last year and flat on a core basis. Q1 revenues of $1.68 billion were unchanged from a year ago, up 1% on a core basis. While revenues came in at the low end of guidance, adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share were at the high end of the guidance, up 8% from a year ago. Operating margin was 17.6%.  We saw a mixed business environment with continued steady growth in life science and applied markets. This was offset by continued weakness in our electronic measurement markets, particularly in aerospace and defense. Despite some ongoing economic headwinds, we continue to benefit from our commitment to manage expenses and reduce manufacturing costs.  We also continue to make excellent progress in preparing for the split of the company. On January 7, we announced Keysight Technologies as the name of the new EM company. We expect the separation to be completed by early November. As I indicated last quarter, Agilent will increasingly differentiate our electronic measurement and LDA businesses in preparation for the company’s separation. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science diagnostics and applied markets. These businesses will be the focus of the new Agilent, as the company continues under my leadership.  Following my remarks, Ron Nersesian will discuss our electronic measurement performance, which will be the focus of the new spinoff company under his leadership. Finally, Didier Hirsch will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent’s overall financial results as well as our guidance for fiscal second quarter and the full year. Turning to LDA, our first quarter performance continued to show solid revenue growth across instruments, services, and consumables. Q1 revenues of $1 billion increased 5% year over year, reflecting strength across most end markets and a healthy Q4 backlog. Q1 orders of $979 million increased 2% over last year. The slowing in the order growth is driven by weaker demand in academic and government markets. Operating margins were up 210 basis points to 19.2%, consistent with our margin expansion goals for the businesses. We continue to focus on attractive end markets, our leading product portfolio, and significant operational leverage. Our end market performance in LDA was particularly strong in pharmaceutical, biotech, clinical, food, and forensics. Pharma revenue grew 8% year over year, with strength in Europe and Japan offsetting slow demand in the U.S. Food revenues were up 14% over last year, as globalization of the industry continued to drive demand for food safety. Forensics grew 26%, driven by the need to identify and characterize new designer drugs entering the global market. And  was up 3%, led by Europe and large refinery projects in the Middle East.  Conversely, academic and government markets declined 10% year over year. Research spending remains constrained, impacted by slow budget releases, particularly in the U.S. and China. Diagnostics and clinical revenues were up 10%. The  was slow, due to a very slow start for the quarter, but the clinical business was robust, driven by CGH arrays and target enrichment. On a regional basis, LDA performance was mixed. Europe continued to see the strongest regional performance, driven by strength in pharma and services. Asia, ex-Japan, also showed strong growth, while Japan was down primarily due to weak currency. Americas was up slightly, constrained by delayed budget releases in Canada and the United States. Within LDA, our life science and diagnostic group, or LDG, had Q1 revenues of $592 million, up 5% from a year ago. Orders of $554 million were flat year over year, reflecting softer instrument demand in the Americas and China. Operating margin was 17%. We signed a new companion diagnostics agreement with Merck . Development projects will include treatments for lung, breast, and gastric cancer. And LDG released the third version of our intelligent system emulation technology for our 1290 Infinity LC systems. The new  allows for emulation of competitors’ systems. Our chemical analysis business continues to show strength across both its instruments and reoccurring revenue portfolios. Q1 revenue grew 6% to $417 million, driven by chemical and energy, as well as non-government food safety markets. Q1 orders grew 4% to $412 million. Operating margin was 23%. In the quarter, chemical analysis launched two spectroscopy systems. The new ICP-MS and MP-AES systems introduced more streamlined operational features and a user-friendly interface. This will enable a wider range of applications and improve accessibility to a broader range of lab personnel. LDA’s outlook for fiscal FY2014 remains positive, as the world economy continues to improve and budgets are settled. While the comparisons will get more difficult starting in Q2, we expect growth trends to continue. Our gross margin proven initiatives continue to progress well, and we see additional opportunities to grow share with new product releases in the pipeline. Our priorities will continue to be centered on improving the customer experience, driving organic growth, increasing our margins, and improving our return on invested capital. LDA revenues for the second fiscal quarter of FY14 are expected to be between $995 million to $1.02 billion, or 4.1% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 18.1%. For the full year, we project a revenue range for LDA of $4.03 billion to $4.13 billion. At the midpoint, LDA’s operating margin is expected to be 19.5%. Didier will provide additional details in his commentary. Thank you for being on the call. Now I’ll turn it over to Ron to talk about the electronic measurement business. Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. For the first quarter, the electronic measurement group reported orders of $699 million, down 7% year over year. EMG revenues also declined 7% in the quarter to $671 million. While orders were consistent with expectations, the impact of Lunar New Year on our ability to recognize revenue late in the quarter was greater than anticipated.  This resulted in revenues that were below our guidance. The book to bill ratio was 1.04 for the quarter. Despite lower than expected revenues, solid gross margin management and disciplined expense control yielded an operating margin of 15.2%.  Taking a closer look at our end market performance, aerospace and defense revenue declined 27% year over year against a tough compare. The first quarter of FY13 was the peak of our aerospace and defense business, prior to U.S. sequestration budget reductions.  Consistent with the positive signals that I noted last quarter, industrial computers and semiconductor revenue increased 4% year over year, driven by investments in next-generation semiconductor process technologies. Communications revenue declined 5% year over year due to softness in wireless R&D and broadband spending. Wireless manufacturing was up 1% year over year. Long term growth drivers remain intact. Wireless standards continue to evolve, driving investment in emerging network technologies. As a result of two key product introductions, EMG is well-positioned to capitalize on these macro trends. As I’ve said before, we are committed to winning in the wireless ecosystem. In November, we introduced a new modular wireless manufacturing test platform called EXM. It is getting strong reviews for both cellular and wireless land tests, and just two weeks ago, we introduced a major new wireless R&D platform called UXM. Both the manufacturing and R&D platforms have multiformat architectures to support 4G standards and can be upgraded as standards evolve. Another key part of our product strategy is to build a modular product offering that leverages our technology leadership in feature-rich instrumentation. Our modular business continues to gain momentum, with orders for PXI and AXIe offerings again showing strong double-digit growth in Q1.  Shifting from Q1 results, we remain focused on our FY14 priorities which are to launch ourselves as an independent company, focus solely on electronic measurement customers, strengthen our position in wireless communications and modular solutions, and to continue to generate strong profit margins for our shareholders. As Bill commented about the split, I am pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to separate EMG from Agilent. On January 7, we announced the name of our new company as Keysight Technologies. As we plan to begin operating under the Keysight Technologies name as a subsidiary of Agilent, effective August 1, the spinoff is expected to occur in November. Despite the extensive work involved with the separation, we remain intensely focused on managing our business without interruption and delivering the quality, innovation, and service that our customers deserve and expect. Turning to our outlook for Q2, Keysight revenues are expected to be in the range of $705 million and $745 million. We expect operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.2%. With expected growth of approximately 8% in the second half of FY14, revenues are now expected to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $3.0 billion, or 2% core growth at the midpoint for FY14. We expect operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.7%. Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our revenue, adjusted for $5 million of unfavorable currency, was $6 million, or 0.4%, below the midpoint of our guidance, but our EPS was $0.01 over. Once again, we were able to deliver on our EPS commitment thanks to our disciplined management of expenses, in line with our operating model. Please note that that Q1 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported in the slide deck, posted on our website. This quarter, currency subtracted about 1.5 percentage points from our year over year revenue growth and acquisitions had no material impact. A final note on Q1, we bought back $100 million of stock in Q1, and therefore completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized by the board in May of 2013. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our second quarter. We expect Q2 revenues of $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion and EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. At the midpoint, revenue will grow 1% on a core basis. Our 18.2% projected operating margin at the midpoint will be 60 basis points higher than in Q1, and 110 basis points lower than Q2 of last year.  Remember that we initiated a drastic cut in discretionary expenses early February of last year that resulted in over $30 million of expense savings in Q2 last year, so we face a tough compare. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we’re also investing in key growth initiatives.  Now to the revised guidance for fiscal year 2014. We’re now expecting fiscal year ’14 revenues to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and at the midpoint this translates into 3.6% core revenue growth. As stated by Ron, EMG has revised down its midpoint revenue guidance by $55 million, to a year over year core growth of 2%. Midpoint operating profit guidance for EMG has been reduced by $35 million and operating margin guidance at the midpoint is 18.7%. At the same time, LDA has increased its midpoint revenue guidance by $5 million to a year over year core growth of 5%. Midpoint operating profit guidance is increased by $4 million, leading to an operating margin midpoint of 19.5%. Agilent EPS is now projected to range from $2.96 to $3.16 and the midpoint of $3.06 is down $0.12 from the November guidance, which represents a reduction of $0.13 coming from EMG offset by an increase of $0.01 from LDA. I’m trying to walk through the math on guidance here. You’ve cut revenues by $15 million. If you assume maybe a 6% decremental, then you’re talking $25 million to EBIT or $0.06. So why are you cutting the bottom line so much? Maybe just talk about why you don’t have additional leverage you could call to maybe offset some of the impact on earnings? As I mentioned, the $55 million revenue decline for EM triggers $35 million operating profit decline. And I’ll let Ron just talk about the incremental decremental. With regards to the decremental, we’ve looked at that closely, and we are anticipating growth of 8% in the second half. And accordingly, we are continuing to invest to bring up new platforms that we think will drive that growth in the second half. And just to follow up, Ron, in your comments you talked about the latest from the Chinese, that looked bigger. Can you maybe just talk to us about whether things have picked up post the quarter and do you expect those delays to come through in the first half? Our orders were right on expectation at $699 million. What happened was we built about $15 million in pipeline due to Lunar New Year. So this is basically products that we’ve received orders for, we shipped, but we’re not able to recognize revenue because of the way Lunar New Year fell. We anticipated and forecasted that to a certain extent, but it was greater than what we thought. We plan to flush that backlog, that $15 million worth of backlog in Q2, as well as have a sequential increase of $39 million to bring our revenue up $54 million in Q2.  Ron, could you elaborate a little more just on the puts and takes to the EMG guidance takedown? What are you factoring for the aerospace and defense business? And if you could give us a view around the comms segment, that would be helpful. For the aerospace and defense segment, that is the biggest segment that really is driving the change. We had expected that to be flat. It actually was down 27% because of the tough compare. So in particular for the year, we’re moving it from flat for the year to down 5%. The comms business, we were forecasting 3% growth before, and now for the year 2% growth. And industrial computer and semi, we were forecasting 5% growth, and we still are. And that business has been turning, especially in the semiconductor space. So the decline is basically driven in the aerospace defense spending. Even though the budget was approved in September, it’s been a slow start. We have seen more acceleration towards the end of Q1 on quote activity and orders start to pick up, but we do believe that there’s a bit of a lag in that recovery.  Could you talk about the  PXI and the dynamics surrounding PXI versus the box business. You know, double digit PXI would suggest you’re, I guess, keeping share. But is the market on the box side coming down? And so can you talk a little bit about share and also the dynamics of box versus PXI? The box business is much greater than the PXI or the modular business, and it continues to be so, but we are building our modular offering because that provides advantages for certain customers. Our modular business is relatively small, and it continues to grow. We’ve stated that it’s roughly $100 million in the past. Last quarter we saw approximately 50% growth and this quarter it was well into double digits, getting close to that same 50% number. So we are seeing traction. At first we brought out some of the infrastructure products, and now we’re coming out with core RF and wireless products to go forward.  As a matter of fact, the platform that we had for manufacturing is a modular platform that we just introduced, and the reviews on that product are very, very good. We’re very pleased with it.  Where do you think market share is? Any change? Is there a gain? Is there a loss? What’s your thought there? We’re definitely gaining share in the PXI market. There’s no doubt about it. I believe our growth is quicker at roughly 50% the last two quarters. But we will continue to work on that. That is a multiyear strategy that we’ll continue to drive over the next five plus years, until we’re number one. On the academic budgets, I want to ask a little bit about the comments there. It seemed like across the rest of the industry in life sciences there was decent fourth quarter budget flushes. So if you could put some color beyond the geographic comments you made there, that would be helpful. I’ll make a comment about China, which is more difficult, then turn it over to Fred to talk about the U.S. Again, a lot of these is who your customer base is, and exactly where you are in the process. Clearly, in China and there, our belief in January was a slowdown in terms of commitments in academic and research. And that was impacted by the Lunar New Year. So I don’t think that we’re going to get a really solid feel to exactly where our position will be in academic and research until Q2. And I’ll have Fred comment about the U.S., which is obviously a large market.  I think, you know, the NIH , if you look at the NIH , we’ve defended it for a large piece of the spending. You see that this is below the spending of 2012. And if you look to the pattern of things which are sold at the moment, there is some hesitation to spend the money on instrumentation as well as on services and consumables, and this is a consideration as we see it at the moment. And I’ll put my editorial on it again. Not to make an excuse, but every time Lunar New Year is in our January, or our Q1, we have a lot of anomalies that are difficult, and unfortunately it only shows up every three or four years. But if you go back over that period of time, it is always an interesting quarter to describe when we have this event. And then just as a follow up, if I could, on Dako, I don’t think I heard it, but if you could give the growth in the quarter there, that would be great. And just if you had any updated views regarding long term strategy here, on moving the  business in there along with diagnostics. And wondering if we might see some meaningful updates to the strategy for that combined asset base before the deal closes. Again, we combined the two organizations between the clinical and our pathology. We’re absolutely convinced our array CGH business as well as our target enrichment is going, and we had a very, very robust growth rate. But we did have a slow quarter versus our Q4. I’ll have Fred make a couple of comments about the pathology specifically, and any other color commentary regarding genomics. The pathology business, as Bill said, was indeed a bit weak. We have pulled in a lot of orders in Q4 of last year. That was one effect. And quite honestly, if you look to the first quarter of fiscal year ’13, this also was impacted by an artifact so that at the moment, Q1 looks a bit low. I think we believe the demand for pathology is pretty robust, and in particular, as Bill mentioned, we see a lot, in particular in the clinical space, I think the micro arrays are outgrowing by far, at the moment, our competitors. Sure  is making inroads into the market, and by the way, also the microfluidics business is growing double digits, mid double digits, and this together gives a good footprint in the clinical space with the genomics products we are providing.  I guess I’m still struggling a little bit in some of the deltas for the quarter, particularly as we look at aerospace and defense. We sort of came into the year, as you said,  flat, and now we’re down 5, but we just had a down 27, when I think last quarter we were down at about 11. So it was a pretty big deterioration. I’m just trying to get a sense for how something like that is so difficult to forecast. Or did it come in closer to where your forecast is and then the comps are going to drive it, etc.? I’m just not sure I totally understand. I know the Lunar New Year and some of the other factors, but I’m just trying to see what transpired maybe from a pacing perspective to where this was so difficult to sort out. Our forecast was to exceed the midrange of the guidance all the way up towards the end of the quarter. And right near the middle of January, the middle to second half of January, we received a very substantial number of requests to delay delivery until after Chinese New Year. That happened in China. We also saw some of that in other areas.  In aerospace/defense, the budget was signed in December, but at first what was happening, the end users didn’t know how much money they were going to get, because it wasn’t passed out to them. We actually saw nice acceleration in aerospace/defense right at the end of the quarter, but obviously that did not translate into revenue.  And don’t forget that Q1 ’13 was the largest quarter that we had in over eight quarters, where in Q4 of ’12, people were placing their last orders before sequestration and then we shipped that, about $195 million, in Q1 of ’13. So we had a very high compare on that standpoint. So aerospace/defense, basically it was a very slow start to spending the money that picked up at the end of the quarter, and then in China, we saw some pushouts, and two orders alone accounted for $11 million worth of the delta. On the guide, the two things that are sort of perplexing to me, or I would say three, one, it seems like some of the issues we had were temporal and there are some assumptions of improvement, and yet sort of the guide, it doesn’t feel as if it reflects all of that. It seems as if you sort of took it down, at least on the revenue side, by more than the delta. So I’m a little bit confused there.  And then on the dropdown, again, to Tycho’s point, it seems like the decrementals are pretty substantial, just relative to the revenue change. Was there any thought process to maybe do more on the cost side? I know it’s always tough, but we’re sort of looking at an earnings picture here that’s similar to where we were four years ago.  So it’s been a pretty frustrating period, I know. Just trying to sense the temporal versus structural nature of some of this, because the guidance implies some of it’s temporal and some of it’s not. So I’m trying to sort out how you thought through that.  From a management perspective, the thinking was very straightforward. Recovery of electronic measurement or  was in the second half of the year. That was the assumption of the guidance. We had a difficult Q1 to interpret. So we’re going into Q2 with quite frankly a fair amount of uncertainty because of the issue that Ron outlined very, very well.  So then the question that comes in is if we don’t change the guidance, then the second half recovery is just enormous, and I think that that would set wrong expectations. So we said if Q2 is what we think it’s going to be, then the second half snap back can’t make up the difference from the first half. So that’s logic number one, and hope we’re wrong, but that’s the logic path that we went in.  On the expense side, we’re in a big Catch 22. We have to win in modules. We have to win in communication. We’ve got to get these new products out. LDA has a whole string of products, and so to take draconian expense cuts, given this uncertainty that we have, also is I don’t think the right answer. And so we made those two tradeoffs moving forward, and try to lay out to investors the best we can what we think will happen, given the problems that we had in Q1 in electronic measurement and the continued uncertainty going forward. And just one follow up. What about on the repo side? You’ve obviously got some flexibility. Stock will be down 5%. I think it’s over that now. I mean, I know there was a lot of hesitance to do that before the split. How much will the volatility and what we’re seeing here, if you do believe somewhat in the recovery thesis, how much does that sort of push you to consider maybe ramping that up a bit? We have been authorized by the board to maintain our share count at I believe it’s 335, and this quarter we’re actually at 338. So yes, we have the cash available, and yes, we have the authorization to continue to make stock repurchases. Let me just make sure that I understand, just to follow up on Ross’s question, the surprises in the quarter were really twofold, one being the Lunar New Year pushouts, and one being the weakness in the aerospace and defense market. Is that correct? Yes. In the short term, the Lunar New Year had a $15 million effect, and we were $19 million off the center of guidance and $9 million off the low end of the range, and the aerospace/defense picture, we believe, will be a slower recovery than we had anticipated before.   And I guess Ron, I think you mentioned that your orders were actually in line with expectations. I’m just trying to square those two comments in my mind. Yes, orders were fine, and that means that our Q2 guidance we could have met if we didn’t have the $15 million delays in the actual revenue recognition or customer acceptance. Longer term, for the second half, we just think that the aerospace/defense market, given its hole in Q1, and given where it’s coming from, is going to be a little bit slower.  So as Bill had mentioned, we have a real hockey stick, from roughly 7% decline in Q1, and we’re forecasting an 8% increase in growth in the second half, so we are expecting a significant upturn. And we’ve seen things like Europe. Europe has posted growth for seven months in a row. That feels very good. The semiconductor market overall feels very good. But there are other mix things that would cause us not to count on more than 8% growth in the second half. So just sort of looking at some of your more government exposed spending, correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe that your environmental forensics, core was down like 7% in Q3 ’13, it was flat Q4, up 7%. You know, is that environmental that’s rebounding there? Or if it is environmental, is it outside of the U.S. that’s doing that? I’m just curious, that also does have some government exposure to it. As you know, we report the combined environmental forensic number externally. The story there actually, and it was a nice surprise, is the strength of the forensics business. And it was up fairly significantly in Q1. A lot of it is being driven by concerns about designer drugs and drugs abuse testing on a global basis, particularly we’re doing very well with various police and security authorities globally. So that’s been a real area of strength for us in the first quarter.  I would tell you that in the more developed countries, particularly in the United States, budgets remain quite sluggish. But I will tell you it’s a different picture than it was last year, which was we knew we were facing sequestration. This year we know the budgets have been restored in certain agencies such as the EPA. We haven’t yet seen those budgets being released. So I hope that gives you some clarity. Yes, the OMIX platform is picking up as we speak. We have shipped a couple of dozen in the latest quarter. The feedback we are getting back from our customers remains positive. And we have put a couple of new assays during the quarter on the platform as well. We are just rolling the product out as the others come in.  And just one final question, have you done any more work in terms of looking at the tax implications of the spend, and just how the tax rates are going to fall? Yes, we have. I apologize for not answering it directly, but we will share that in the Mach analyst day meeting. But we are very, very close to determining essentially what the tax rate will be for the new Agilent moving forward, and the range for our key sites in there. But please wait until March, and we will have that.  I think it’s important that I don’t give the number now, because the Form 10 will be published right before that, and then you will get a historical perspective of what the actual tax rates have been for what the two companies have been if they were independent. So I think it’s good to see the total answer in context moving forward. I continue to say that we are taking the opportunity to look at ways to ensure that we have sufficient cash in the U.S. Obviously Keysight has to have sufficient cash in the U.S. moving forward, and so there will be some tweaking of the overall tax rate. Bill, on the first quarter, on the LDA side, the area of life science and diagnostics, if we look at the gap between order and revenues, trying to go back in history a little bit, it looks a little bit out of the ordinary from a historical perspective. You mentioned you had  demand in the U.S. and China, but anything else that kind of ends up  in terms of the orders ? No, I think as Fred said, there’s clearly a lot of orders that were pulled into the last month of our Q4. The start off in November was terrible. We ended in January, I think, quite fine, I think a 7% growth rate, but we had a terrible start to the quarter. And I don’t know if we’ve trained all of our new employees about how the compensation system works at Agilent, for many, many decades, but nonetheless, we just had a terrible start to Q1.  January was fine, so basically some of the order shortfall in November got booked in October is basically what I’m saying, and we exited the quarter on the runway, and we think that we’re going to have solid growth as we move forward. But we did have a slow start to our Q1. Hey, Bill, can I add some initial commentary from the chemical analysis side, which is, as you know, we have a large footprint of our businesses in Asia, so the story of Chinese New Year really did impact us, because we lost basically a good week or so worth of quarter end orders. And then also, back to the comments on U.S. government spending, I know earlier we were focusing on the life science implications of the U.S. government spending, but also it had a material impact on the results for CA in terms of the order rates coming in for the first quarter, albeit it’s a much different story than it was a year ago, because budgets have been restored, and we just need to wait for them to be released. And then, if I could just ask the question, maybe a little bit of a two-parter here, you talked about emerging markets like they’re one country. Obviously they’re all individual countries. Historically Agilent has had a nice, strong presence there.  has been a little bit less robust recently, so I guess one, can you give us some color about how you’re seeing the forecast in those markets for you for the rest of your ’14?  And then maybe tying that into strong EM business, maybe help me understand what gives you confidence that you will see that 8% growth in the second half. Historically, I know there’s always been a bit of a hockey stick, but talking to competitors now, everyone seems to say that they’re not seeing it yet, and I guess what are the major drivers this time around? I’ll make a couple of comments on the LDA side, and then turn it over to Ron on the Keysight side. Again, our non-GAAP in East Asia business grew 8%. Obviously China/Korea was very, very strong for us in the quarter. India continues to struggle. I think in the Americas, Brazil has its challenges moving forward. And so there are issues out there that we have to address, but quite frankly China just dominates the position for LDA. So how China goes, that’s how our emerging markets will go. As far as emerging markets, we sell in aerospace/defense to some of the emerging markets, in particular Russia, a little bit to India, and some to China. And we saw those markets were soft. As a matter of fact, if you add them up, like some other competitors have announced previously, our orders were off 16% in Q1 in the emerging markets. And again, that’s an overlay with aerospace/defense in certain areas. So that’s the environment that we’re seeing there, which tends to correlate with the guidance that we have going forward. The things that make us excited is when we look at the second half, Europe continues to be strong, from the standpoint that it’s grown seven months in a row. And we had two major product platforms that we’ll start shipping in the second half. One is the wireless manufacturing platform, which is a modular based platform that’s getting excellent reviews, and the latest is the new one that we just announced a couple of weeks ago, which is a new wireless R&D platform. And just to give you an idea, this platform is the latest and greatest. It’s up there, and customers have been giving us reviews saying it’s the best platform that exists on the market. It handles LTE advanced and category six data rates up to 300 megabits. It does carrier aggregations, all the latest things. And it has integrated fading, which is typically something that someone would have to buy a  product and hook it up with their wireless product in order to make the solution happen.  So when we take a look at the strength of the products, the feedback that we’ve had in these areas, how Europe has turned around, and also how things are starting to pick up in some other areas, that gives us the confidence for the second half. Ron, one clarification. You sized your PSI business at roughly $100 million. I’m curious if that’s a trailing 12-month basis, or is that from annualizing current quarterly results? And I guess I was curious, when you talked about the drivers for the  in the second half, you didn’t mention necessarily the Chinese opportunity, and you didn’t really mention wireless test directly. I guess you did talk about your two major product lines. So I’m curious, can you update us on timing or opportunity with China Mobile? I think you previously sized that at, I think, a $30 million annual opportunity. And can you talk about wireless test and expectations there? There’s no doubt with our new platform that’s coming out, we are gaining momentum. If you look at two areas where we probably had the biggest product holes on a competitive basis, it was in the wireless manufacturing and wireless R&D platforms. And we have really come a very long way in those areas within the past year. With regard to China Mobile, for the TDD/LTE spectrum, it was awarded to all three players ahead of schedule. Commercial licenses have been issued, and China Mobile plans to put in place 500,000 LTE base stations in 340 Chinese cities. And we’re very much engaged in that. Obviously Ericsson is number one in share, Huawei two, NSM three, and Alcatel Lucent four, and we are very strong in the base station area, and will continue to try to win that business. And I guess going back to the wireless test side, you had a competitor that said that the market compressed from about a $1.3 billion opportunity to $1 billion since 2013. Do you agree with that assessment? And two, do you expect that the competition is going to continue to compress that market in 2014? Or should that industry come back to growth? We see growth in communications for us. We have forecasted a 2% growth for the year. The market’s probably flat. There are two things that are going on there. We’re obviously seeing the unit volume increases from 1.8 billion phones or the 1 billion smartphones that are being produced today.  But you also do see some price erosion that goes on as we’ve seen more consolidation in the marketplace, and you’ve seen a couple of the smartphone manufacturers actually put a little bit more pressure on the market.  The good thing about this market is these standards continue to evolve. They are very highly complex technical challenges, and accordingly, we seem to offset that with our business in R&D or by having leading edge technology. But looking at all that, we still see that 2% growth when you factor in the unit growth and the pricing situation.  And last one, I guess for Bill, there’s some components and subsystem suppliers in your academic and government food chain that are seeing an uptick in demand, especially in North America, given the Ryan Murray budget deal. And although you reported this area as being a soft area for you in the quarter, I’m curious if you’ve seen any impact at all from the budget deal. I’m not sure that I know. No, there’s nothing for us. Again, we’ve been a late entry into that market since our program that we made in triple quad and , and obviously in our genomics area. And so I’m not sure that our own issues are somewhat unique to what our investment strategy is and exactly who those customers are. So we’re not of knowledge that any particular impact good or bad, versus the  that you had asked about. My first question is on the decrementals again. I mean, the decrementals implied in the EMG guidance are, to be fair, pretty surprising. If we go back 12 to 18 months, you said you couldn’t cut spending any more in  without cutting into bone. Then last year you found ways to cut a lot more than people expected. Now it doesn’t seem like you’re getting to the leverage one would have expected to see if the cuts you had made in the second half of last year were sustainable. In hindsight, did you guys cut too far last year? And has something changed that suggest that you now need to invest more in what appears to be a more challenging environment than you had anticipated? There’s no doubt we cut very deeply, and I would say that we were on edge. There are a couple of product areas where we really needed to invest and win. It’s as simple as that. The wireless one box testers, we talked about those key products. And again, we’re in this for the long haul. We don’t want to be short sighted. If we didn’t anticipate an upturn that would be coming within quarters, we would potentially do something different. But given how important it is for us to be number one, and given what we see coming, we believe that this is in the best interest of the shareholders and they’ll be happy for it over time. The last few quarters you talked about picking up share in areas like LC and to an extent mass-spec. And looking at your results, it’s not clear that that continued into Q1, especially when you look at your growth and how it compares to your peers. And related to this, it doesn’t seem like your pharma growth was nearly as robust as some of your peers. What was different this quarter for you? Again, be very careful comparing quarter to quarter, particularly given our quarter is off all of our competitors. We had a very strong end of the year. Our competitors had a very strong close at their end of the year. You really have to look at the rolling four quarters when you look at Agilent moving forward.  If you in fact look at the organic growth rate, the last four, we’re basically at the overall market. I would argue the second half of the last two quarters we have been slightly above that. At the beginning of the year we were slightly below that moving forward.  But again, I’d be very cautious of making those comparisons, because I’m sure that many people ask our competitors, how come Agilent had such a great four? And again, I think you’ve got to really normalize it on a calendar day to really get a true view of what the true organic growth rate is. Bottom line is, last four quarters we were basically growing at the overall market, which we believe is about 5% organic growth rate. And even this quarter, we’ve grown 6.4% on the currency adjusted. Taking into account the fact that we had China New Year, which our competitors don’t, and last year it wasn’t there, it was in February. All good points, but to be fair, you guys were the ones who proactively said you were picking up share in some of these areas. Do you still believe you’re picking up share? I am very cautious on market share. All the comment was is that our growth in the fiscal year was higher at that point in time than the competition. Then they ended their fiscal year and you saw that little bit of shift moving forward. We are very, very cautious on doing it. The competition is very, very good. They have their up and down quarters, we have our up and down quarters, specifically in areas that we have done well, such as the LC, other areas that we have been below the market. And so in aggregate, right now, if you look at where everyone is today, plus our additional month, we’re roughly, non currency adjusted, at a 5% organic growth rate, which is the weighted average of the market.  And last question, and I think it’s an important one, even though right now it’s not a huge part of your business, as we look ahead, and we think about the company post-split, one of the things that’s got people excited about the story is the prospects of life sciences being an above-market grower with the potential to really expand margins at your growth levels. But one important component of that is really anatomical pathology growing strongly, and you guys did talk about not having a great quarter there. And again, one quarter doesn’t make a trend, but can you tell us, were autostainer placements about where you expected them to be, or was that a source of weakness in the quarter relative to plan? No, as Fred said, our placement is going exactly as we want it to do. I’ve also been very clear that we are taking a very deliberate path to install, to ensure that the equipment works, that there aren’t issues moving forward, that we have the right products that are validated on it, that we have new releases. And again, we’ve said this for many years, this is going to be a slow, methodical process. We did not want to get ourselves in a situation where we overextend ourselves, we get placements in place that aren’t performing to what we believe the instrument can perform. So we are systematically engaging, as Fred said, and installing a dozen systems every quarter. Maybe just two on the cost within the P&L. In the past, you guys have talked a little bit about your ability to, within your model, take down fixed costs in addition to some of the variable portions if you do need to. How much of a lever are you actually finding that to be at this point? And I guess the follow up, what portion of the cost structure is actually variable at this point? I’m going to go back to the broad strategic decision. We, based on our guidance, given the uncertainty, are not going to pull the trigger right this moment to dramatically reduce our variable spending. We could do that, Didier talked about it. We did a year ago and took $30 million out. All of the triggers that we have in place still exist. There is too much uncertainty in the quarter to execute that.  The issue clearly is in Keysight. , soon to be a large shareholder, is all about growth, and we have to continue to execute on the programs that we have had. And obviously Ron and the team, as they move forward the new board - in fact, if you don’t have the , you can pull those triggers. So we can do that tomorrow. It is quite easy to pull the triggers. All the variable components that we have in place are exactly the way they were in the past. But just given the outlook it is, I’m in 100% support of Ron and his decision to continue to execute the plan and be realistic on what the second half recovery can be, and not just sit here today at the beginning of the year and hope for somehow you’re going to get a huge growth in the second half of the year. And I just don’t want to set unrealistic expectations.  Any split costs you guys have in your assumptions for guidance for the rest of the year? Or is it probably the same thing, the 25 that you saw this quarter and the pull through? No, we’ll give more detail in the March meeting. But in terms of the split cost, what we will say is that the one-time separation costs will be higher than what we said before. We’re doing two things. One is we’re accelerating and expanding the branding of Keysight, and I think that’s clearly a worthwhile investment. And we are making greater progress on the separation than we had alluded to. The outcome of that will be that the synergy costs on the Keysight side are going to be minimal, and the synergies on the Agilent side are going to be higher, just because of the great job the team has done in separating. As a result of that, for example, the service agreements that Agilent was soon to provide to Keysight, there are not going to be that many service sites. Again, we are making superb progress in setting up the IT systems, separating the real estate, setting up all the systems to ensure that Keysight can be a very credible, established company from the get go. But other than the shift back and forth, there isn’t any substantive material change than what we’ve talked about, in my opinion.   Thank you, operator, and just wanted to say thank you, everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I’d like to wish you a good day. '"
